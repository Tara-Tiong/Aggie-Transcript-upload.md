		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Rayan Kaakati, Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior

Being born female automatically registers you in a game of Russian roulette: one out of eight women will have invasive breast cancer during their lives. Breast cancer is a disease that starts in the tissues of the breast and is statistically fatal for about one in thirty-six women (Breast Cancer Facts), but that does not mean it is a walk in the park for its survivors or even for women who end up not developing the disease. <!--more--> My closest experience with breast cancer has been with my Aunt Hala, who was born in Lebanon in 1962 and still lives there. Hala was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. To Lebanese, cancer is referred to as “The malicious disease” or, reminiscent of Lord Voldemort, “the-not-to-be-named disease.” People refuse to even mention the word cancer (“sarattan” in Arabic), and many who get it are kept in the dark about what is afflicting them. They pass away unaware of their real condition, thinking they have a bad cold instead of lung cancer or a bad intestinal infection or an ulcer rather than gastrointestinal cancer, and so on.  However, this silence is not the case with breast cancer; everyone is aware that once you have a lump, you end up losing your entire breast through a mastectomy, as in Hala’s case, or if you’re “lucky”, then you end up having a lumpectomy and only a portion of your breast is removed. And if the odds aren’t in your favor, you may end up losing your life all together.

Hala, the youngest among five sisters, initially ignored her lump. The thought of having the disease was stressful enough to send her into complete denial. By the time she casually mentioned it to one of her sisters a few weeks after discovering what felt like a “hard lump” in her right breast, hoping the older sister would also be nonchalant about it, the disease was at stage three. The denial phase of cancer is common for most women, as studies show that more than one third of women who feel a lump in their breast postpone going to the doctor for at least three months (Jauhar). This could be due to multiple reasons, such as the cost of cancer treatment, fear of a mastectomy, the terror of chemotherapy, or the thought of death.

Soon after her first doctor’s visit, Hala went from denial to acceptance; the anger stage never came. She put up a strong front that helped all of us cope with this dreaded intruder into the family. Aisha, the eldest of the sisters, had a hard time accepting that Hala had cancer and kept hoping it would be benign until the mastectomy. Another aunt insisted that she should not accept the surgeon’s recommendation of “carving her up” and kept referring to the surgeon as the “butcher.” Others unknowingly opted for a worse approach—not talking about the issue at all—giving Hala the feeling that the Angel of Death had parked his chariot outside her door.

It is stressful enough for a person to be diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, but what is overlooked is the barrage of issues that surface that forces you to look at your illness as only one of many issues that unfold.  You are forced to alleviate the pain and worries of others as they worry not only about you, but also about themselves, because you having cancer makes the Russian roulette game even more dangerous for them. I could only imagine how my other aunts felt as they watched Hala battle cancer, as the doctor informed them during the six chemotherapy and twenty-five radiation sessions that the risk of them developing breast cancer doubles automatically since they now have a close blood relative— their baby sister— with the disease. The barrel was now staring them hard in the chest, and the troubles of searching for the best doctors and hospitals with the latest medical equipment and treatments only added to their worries.  Hala’s main worries came from informing relatives overseas, receiving constant phone calls and visits from well-wishers, and pondering over the the big brain teasers of “what if’s.”

The “what if’s” invaded Hala’s thoughts day and night: what if I lose both of my breasts, or the cancer is metastatic and spreads to other parts of my body, or what if the cancer I have is not responsive to chemotherapy, or worse, what if I have prolonged illness and my body wilts away?

Women who get the disease worry about the hardship of treatment, the dreaded five-year wait before you can be blessed with the “in remission” certificate, and the lifelong uncertainty about whether the disease will resurrect itself. One year after her mastectomy, the doctors reassessed her progress and recommended an oophorectomy, which is the removal of the ovaries in order to reduce the amount of steroid hormones, progesterone and estrogen, circulating in the system (Eldor and Spiegel, 81). Hala’s doctor explained to her that estrogen was to tumor cells what fertilizer is to weeds. As a consequence of the oophorectomy, she developed osteoporosis, which is the weakening and dissolving of the bones caused by a lack of estrogen. Currently, Hala still has osteoporosis and is taking Provila once a month to strengthen her bones, in addition to the calcium supplement she takes every day. Hala and her sisters were grateful to her doctor for taking the time to inform them about the disease. Consequently, mammograms have become an annual tradition in my family that was never strictly adhered to before Hala’s ordeal. In Hala’s words, “by understanding my disease and available treatment options, I voluntarily accepted the poisonous medications the doctor prescribed me.”

Hala described her medications as “poisonous” after experiencing the bouts of vomiting, lack of appetite, weakness, and severe nausea every time she would take them (this is not to mention the burning feeling, after each one of the twenty-five radiation sessions Hala attended, that would only go away once she rubbed a pound of Biafine ointment on her breast).  In fact, every time Hala came near the Rezk Hospital in Beirut for her chemotherapy session, she would automatically show “anticipatory nausea and vomiting.” This phenomenon occurs at the sight, smell, and sound of the treatment center that reminds patients of previous chemotherapy sessions (National Cancer Institute). Once the stomach-twisting feeling of nausea crept over her, not even the prescribed Zofran could stop it. There came a time when Hala felt so defeated during the chemotherapy sessions that she wondered whether it was easier to succumb to the disease than to withstand the punishment of the medications. Her six chemotherapy sessions, twenty-one days apart, strangled the life out of her, and in the words of Hala: “The doctors will strangle you and the disease to the brink of death—hoping the disease will surrender first”.

The breast of a woman signifies the bounty of a crop, the generosity of a rain cloud over a thirsty land yearning to be quenched.  Humans are born to suckle the juice of life from the breast the minute they exit the womb, when cancer targets that organ, an afflicted woman cannot help but feel an onslaught upon her being. Nature, for some unknown reason, has thrown a poison into her wellspring, and modern medicine’s “cure,” to date, is as cruel as the disease itself.

While many studies have characterized those affected by breast cancer, based on age, drinks per day, smoking, race, breast-feeding, etc, a cure or a vaccination for the disease has not been discovered yet.  Women are still waiting for a quantum leap in the field of medicine, where gene therapy or manipulation of various amino acids will eventually replace chemotherapy, radiation, and the surgical carving up of patients. Nine years after her breast and ovaries were taken from her,  Hala still stands strong as a powerful symbol to all women. By enduring through the physical, mental, and spiritual tribulations of cancer, Hala has been a positive impact on her family and community as she openly discusses her experience battling cancer and is an avid promoter and participant of regular breast cancer screening—and most importantly—she is a survivor.<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

Sjogren’s syndrome, like other autoimmune diseases, can be difficult to diagnose definitively, and often relies on a handful of signs and symptoms that can vary substantially from case to case. The only signs considered markers for Sjogren’s are anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, and while anti-SSB is more specific, elevated levels of anti-SSB are actually less common in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome than anti-SSA, leading to some ambiguity in diagnosis.

A seventeen year old female patient presented with a large, soft, sublingual cyst on the left side of the floor of her mouth. While she reported no pain, the cyst was first spotted about a year earlier, and had been growing steadily. Visible swelling was observed on the left side of her face under her jaw line. Surgery was performed to remove the cyst, and an adjacent salivary gland was removed as well. The otorhinolaryngologist took a tissue sample, and histology confirmed a benign growth. The surgeon ordered a blood panel to evaluate antibody levels that might indicate an autoimmune disease. The patient’s serum was negative for rheumatoid factor, anti-SSB antibodies, and anti-nuclear antibodies. However, she was positive for anti-SSA antibodies, with a level of 50 U/ml. Bacterial cultures were negative for oral infection, and an X-ray was negative for sarcoidosis. Patient was discharged after surgery with no medications indicated, as she was not experiencing any other symptoms.

<!--more-->

At age twenty, the patient again noticed a sublingual cyst on the floor of her mouth, this time on her right side. Upon inspection, the otorhinolaryngologist confirmed the presence of a lymphangioma. Two months later, it had grown and caused the adjacent sublingual salivary gland to rupture, resulting in a ranula at the floor of her mouth. The patient sought treatment, and the otorhinolaryngologist ordered an MRI to examine the ranula. The lymphangioma was found to be growing towards another salivary gland, presumably causing the sialadenitis observed in that gland. The ranula and the ruptured sublingual salivary gland were then surgically excised. Histology again ruled out malignancy, but suggested Sjogren’s syndrome or another autoimmune disease.

The ENT surgeon referred the patient to a rheumatologist, who performed a blood panel to rule out other autoimmune disorders. The patient was again negative for rheumatoid factor and her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal. However, her IgG subclass 4 levels were 253 mg/ml, well beyond the normal range of 0-150 mg/ml.

The rheumatologist also tested for other signs and symptoms of Sjogren’s. The patient was negative for dry skin, dry mouth, joint pain, circulation or perfusion issues, and general fatigue. Family history was mostly negative for any signs or symptoms of Sjogren’s aside from the patient’s mother having dry eyes. The mother reported no other symptoms and was not tested for Sjogren’s syndrome. No other additional abnormalities were observed.<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

The patient was sent home but placed under observation with biannual checkups for three years after the second surgical removal of the cyst, and annual checkups indefinitely after that. Three months later, she complained of mild to moderate skin dryness, and was prescribed Lac-Hydrin 12% lotion and urea 40% lotion. An optometrist noticed mildly dry eyes, but no treatment was suggested. The patient currently lives otherwise symptom-free and has not had any recurrence of abnormal growths in her mouth.

<b>Discussion</b>

Sjogren’s syndrome (SS), named after the Swedish ophthalmologist who first reported on the condition, is a relatively common autoimmune disease, affecting up to 2 million people in the United States. In patients with SS, the immune system attacks the salivary and lacrimal glands, causing dry mouth and dry eyes, respectively. There is no known cause of Sjogren’s syndrome, and no preventative treatment is known. However, genetic factors and environmental factors are suspected of playing a role in the development of the syndrome. There is some indication of high gluten sensitivity in patients with Sjogren's syndrome, which can be related to the inflammation that gluten is known to potentially cause. Viral infections may also potentially increase the likelihood of SS through molecular mimicry that triggers autoimmunity.

Common symptoms of SS are dry mouth, dry eyes, dry skin, and less often, general fatigue, rashes, and joint pain. The most typical symptoms are dry eyes and dry mouth, which range in severity. Some patients have mild discomfort, while others can experience blurry vision and chronic eye irritation, and patients with dry mouth can have difficulty swallowing or eating dry foods and an increased likelihood of tooth decay. Most patients with the disorder have mild to moderate symptoms, but in rare cases, SS can cause organ failure. Patients are also more susceptible to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the white blood cells. About 5% of patients with Sjogren’s syndrome will have a malignant growth, but overall, the mortality rates of patients with SS are very similar to the normal population. While the symptoms are usually well managed and patients can live comfortably, patients who get pregnant have an increased risk of their elevated antibodies crossing the placenta and causing neonatal lupus erythematosus with a congenital heart block that requires a pacemaker.

While treatments of the condition are currently not known, drugs that help manage symptoms can be prescribed to patients with moderate to severe symptoms. Artificial tears or eye lubricants can be used to alleviate dry eyes, and cyclosporine can reduce loss of eye moisture by reducing ocular inflammation that can inhibit secretion of tears. A punctal plug can also be inserted to slow the rate of tear drainage and allow tears to continue lubricating the eye for a longer time.  Several OTC mouthwashes are available to reduce oral dryness, and cevimeline can be used to stimulate salivation. Hydroxychloroquine can be used to treat joint pain and rashes on a symptomatic basis. More severe systemic symptoms, especially of the internal organs, can be treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs, but must be used with caution due to increased risk of infections. Patients, particularly those with dry mouth, must be regularly monitored for tooth decay, as dental caries are quite common and can progress to severe decay if left untreated.

Like other autoimmune disorders, Sjogren’s syndrome is difficult to diagnose definitively, and relies on antibody levels, physical signs, and patient symptoms. The oral cavity in particular must be examined for any growths associated with salivary gland occlusion or blockage. Elevated levels of anti-nuclear antibodies can indicate SS, and are present in about 70% of patients. Rheumatoid factor is also common in SS patients (60-70%) but can be indicative of other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels of IgG subclass 4 are also commonly found in SS patients but are not specific. The antibodies that are considered actual markers for SS are anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies. While elevated anti-SSA antibodies are more common than anti-SSB antibodies in SS patients (about 70% vs 40%), the latter is a more specific marker for SS, while the former can also indicate systemic lupus erythematosus.

Since Sjogren’s syndrome can be secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, it is essential for healthcare providers to rule out these potentially more severe diseases. Diagnosing them, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, can be difficult since there are not any exact, definitive markers or tests available. A rheumatoid factor assay is essential on any blood panel, since that is an indicator of rheumatoid arthritis, and an x-ray to rule out sarcoidosis in the lungs is recommended to avoid missing an underlying cause of rheumatoid arthritis that may look like simply SS on a blood test. The SS markers anti-SSA and anti-SSB must be included on the blood panel as well, but since anti-SSA is also indicative of lupus, caution should be used in diagnosing a patient with SS until other antibody levels are assessed and a thorough physical examination is performed.

What do you picture when you think about surgery? Most likely, you imagine a person having their body cut open, and then a surgeon performing what is necessary to fix the problem, whether that be removing a damaged organ or tissue, repairing damages internally, or performing some other procedure. In all of these cases, it is expected that the doctor makes a cut large enough so that he or she can see what is inside of the body and operates. However, a new method of surgery takes a radically different approach. Laparoscopic surgery, also called minimally invasive surgery, Band-Aid surgery, or keyhole surgery, is a relatively new surgical technique that is revolutionizing the surgical field. Traditionally, surgery is performed by making a large incision in order to directly view and operate on the tissues, organs, and other structures of interest inside of the body. In contrast, with laparoscopic surgery, a series of small incisions, typically of .5 cm to 1.5 cm, are made along the abdomen.<!--more--> At each incision, commonly referred to as a port, a small tube called a trocar is inserted, and it essentially serves as an entrance for other materials that are necessary for the surgery. First, carbon dioxide gas must be inserted into the abdomen to inflate it, allowing space for the surgeon to view inside and perform the necessary work. Then, a camera attached to a laparoscope is inserted into the body and transmits images to a viewing screen in the room, which enables the surgeon to see what is necessary to perform the surgery. Other devices, such as surgical stapling devices and energy sources, are also passed through the trocars for other uses inside the body.  While most incisions for laparoscopic surgery are fairly small, often, a larger incision, ranging from 2 to 4 inches, must be made to allow removal of tissue. Additionally, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is sometimes used. In this method, a larger incision is made, allowing for  the surgeon to insert his or her hand into the abdomen and thus directly perform the surgery, while still using the same devices as laparoscopic surgery (Peters, 2012). After the surgery is complete, the carbon dioxide is removed from abdomen, the devices inside are removed, and stitches are used to close the incisions.

Although laparoscopic surgery is a relatively new technique and thus not entirely commonplace, there are many procedures that commonly use this method. Most of the procedures that utilize it are centered near the abdomen, as this is the area most easily accessible through the small incisions. The most common procedure using laparoscopic surgery is cholecystectomy, which is removal of the gallbladder. In fact, almost all gallbladder removals in the U.S. are now performed by laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, it is used for a variety of other procedures, examples being gastric bypass surgery, hernia repair, anti-reflux surgery, liver and biliary disease treatment, hiatal hernia treatment, splenectomy, colon and intestinal disorders, ulcer surgery, appendix removal, and adrenal gland removal (Saber, 2014). While traditional surgical procedures are still more common than the laparoscopic methods in some of these examples, there is a trend in increasing utilizing laparoscopic surgical techniques. Additionally, these are just the most common examples of laparoscopic procedures, and there are other procedures that utilize laparoscopic methods.

There are many measures taken to ensure the safety of this procedure. To start, before the surgery is considered, the patient must undergo an abdomen inspection to ensure that they are a candidate for laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, previous health conditions are considered, as some conditions may put a patient at risk during the procedure. This measure decreases the likelihood of the patient experiencing any problems during the procedure. However, if there are problems during the operation, there are ways to prevent further damage. For instance, if there is too much inflammation, a larger incision will be made to complete the surgery. Additionally, if anything else goes wrong the surgeon can always modify the procedure to make sure it remains safe (Peters, 2012).

There are a number of advantages to laparoscopic surgery as opposed to traditional surgery. To start, the small size of the incision provides a variety of benefits. First, it reduces the risk of blood loss and hemorrhaging, since the area being cut open is much smaller. This, in turn, reduces the need for blood transfusions, which minimizes the potential for infections. Additionally, internal organs are less externally exposed, also reducing the risk for infection. Beyond the advantages during the surgery, there are also advantages after the surgery is complete. To start, scarring is minimized, since the incisions are not as large. Additionally, the small incision size reduces the pain that the patient feels following the procedure, so he or she is able to return to their normal daily routine sooner. Lastly, the shorter recovery time allows for a shorter hospital stay, which both reduces hospital bills and decreases the amount of time that the patient is exposed to the possible infections associated with hospital stays (Mandal, 2010).

Overall, laparoscopic surgery is a new advancement in medicine that allows for new methods of surgery that require fewer incisions and less pain. The procedure is just as safe as traditional surgery, and also provides a number of advantages to the patient, both during and following the procedure. For these reasons, laparoscopic surgery is becoming more popular, and once technology advances even further, it may take the place of traditional surgery almost entirely.

<strong>Scope</strong>

This article was inspired by a friend who is an International Relations and Economics major. She was interested in the science behind HIV and AIDS because she only knew about the stigma carried with being infected with HIV and that it is an incurable virus. After talking to my friend for a few hours, I realized that many people don’t know too much about HIV besides how it spreads and that there is no current cure. My friend was amazed by how complicated HIV was and hopes that future policies about HIV and AIDS will have more background information rather than going with public opinion about the virus. The overarching goal of the paper is to inform the reader about what HIV and AIDS is, what HIV does to the human body, and what treatments are currently available. I hope that you, the reader, will be able to carry out some form of conversation about HIV and AIDS after reading this article.

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that causes the depletion of white blood cells involved in the immune system. HIV is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood, and has killed more than 25 million people worldwide since its discovery in 1981 (Barmania et al., 2013). It is important to note that having HIV does not automatically mean a person will be diagnosed with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows deadly diseases or opportunistic pathogens thrive and eventually kill the host. When white blood cells have fallen below a certain level, then a healthcare professional may diagnose the patient with AIDS. According to AIDS.gov, over 35 million people worldwide are currently living with HIV or AIDS.

<strong>What does HIV do to the body?</strong>

Whenever there is a threat to the body, such as a bacterial or viral infection, the immune system is able to detect and react to the situation. Once the cells of the immune system detect the threat, they are able to undergo selective divisions that increase the ability to identify the threat, and then initiate an immune response. Following these infections, the cells able to contain and eliminate the threat remain in the body as memory cells. These memory cells allow the immune system to initiate its defenses effectively when encountering the same threat, even years after initial infection (Parham, 2014). HIV attacks the immune system and compromises it. Every time HIV attacks the body, the number of white blood cells in a person significantly drops. The decreased number of white blood cells weakens the host’s immune system and the host becomes more susceptible to other diseases and is less able to defend against them. Diseases such as the common cold, which a healthy adult can overcome in a few days, become deadly because the immune system is weakened.

HIV is difficult to eradicate because HIV’s replication process leads to different variations, making it a master of disguise. It was found that HIV has different techniques it uses in order to “hide” inside white blood cells until the virus decides to replicate and divide (Stevenson et al., 1990). HIV will continue use the host’s cells in order to replicate by producing viral proteins and assembling them into new viruses. Its ability to effectively mutate allows it to evade the fast immune attack from the immune system because it has no memory of the “new” virus. The immune system must learn to recognize and fight a different version of the virus. However, during this time, the number of white blood cells decreases significantly and the host struggles to fight off other diseases. In summary, HIV destroys the human immune system internally making the host susceptible to opportunistic pathogens, and if the number of white blood cells is low enough, the host may be diagnosed with AIDS.

<strong>Treatment(s) Available</strong>

Although there is no cure for HIV, being infected with the virus is not a death sentence. The most effective treatment available is antiretroviral therapy (ART), which can significantly prolong the lives of people who are HIV-positive by using a combination of antiretroviral drugs in order to suppress the virus. In fact, with the continuous use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), most patients treated with ART live normal lives. However, suppressing the virus is only temporary and continuous treatment is necessary in order to prevent HIV from returning. Researchers are currently on the search for a less dependent treatment and more importantly, a vaccine.

<strong>Takeaway</strong>

When HIV and AIDS were first appeared in the 1980’s, it was a very mysterious disease. It baffled many doctors, and scared the general public because it looked like healthy, young individuals were prematurely passing away for unexplained reasons. Fear is a dangerous emotion, and the fear surrounding the epidemic has resulted in the creation of many myths about HIV and AIDS, as well as negative attitudes towards those infected. Because HIV can only be transmitted through bodily fluids, HIV is often associated with behaviors people disapprove of, such as irresponsible drug use and immoral sexual behavior.

Becoming more knowledgeable about HIV and AIDS can make us more aware and understanding of what someone who is HIV positive is going through and prevent HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Although HIV and AIDS is a large and active area of research, there is still no known cure as of today. Further studies are needed in order for the discovery of potential treatments and vaccines for HIV in the future. However, we can be educated about the topic of HIV and AIDS. Education about HIV and AIDS is important because of its prevalence in the world, and the best way to prevent the physical spread of HIV is by understanding the science behind it.

<strong>Author's Note:  </strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px">"I wrote this literature review as an assignment for UWP104F (Writing in the Professions: Health). We were able to choose any health problem of our interest and review current research pertaining to that topic. I chose to write about dementia particularly because it affects my grandmother. To this day, my family and I do not know how she went from being a fairly healthy 40 year old woman to being a person with Alzheimer's disease. During my research, I came across an abundance of literature pertaining to the relationship between dementia and the blood supply to the brain. The notion of hypertension being a potential indicator of later dementia captured most of my interest given that it is relatively common in the US compared to other countries. What we can learn about the link between blood supply and the brain may give us a better understanding of dementia as well as insight for prevention."</p>

<b>Abstract</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">The global prevalence of dementia is expected to double by 2050. Because there is no curative treatment to date, numerous studies have focused on prevention and early detection of cognitive impairment. Several longitudinal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of antihypertensive drug (AHD) treatment in preventing cognitive decline in hypertensive individuals. However, subsequent studies found an association between AHD treatment and greater cognitive decline in individuals 85+ years with baseline cognitive impairment. </span><span style="font-weight:400">Overtreatment of AHD, cardiovascular disease as well as high mid-life blood pressure can lead to the development of late-life hypotension, which in turn, can lead to dementia. </span><span style="font-weight:400">Thus, further research on different populations is needed to confirm the efficacy, if any, of AHD treatment and blood pressure monitoring in preventing late-life dementia in middle-aged individuals with hypertension.</span>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Today, approximately 24 million people in the world suffer from dementia and this number is expected to double every 20 years approaching 81 million by 2040</span><span style="font-weight:400">1</span><span style="font-weight:400">. Because there is no known cure to date, identifying modifiable risk factors are critical for prevention. Chronic hypertension has been associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease due to vascular mechanisms that ultimately reduce cerebral perfusion (</span><span style="font-weight:400">2)</span><span style="font-weight:400">. Several longitudinal studies have demonstrated the potential of antihypertensive (AHD) treatment in preventing cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients. However, the extent to which studies imply that AHD treatment would be effective in preventing cognitive impairment for all hypertensive patients remains uncertain. For older individuals with hypertension along with baseline cognitive decline, lowering blood pressure increased cognitive decline (</span><span style="font-weight:400">6)</span><span style="font-weight:400">. On the contrary, individuals who received AHD treatment for midlife hypertension had better episodic memory and lower rates of cognitive impairment in later-life than those without midlife hypertension (</span><span style="font-weight:400">9)</span><span style="font-weight:400">. </span><span style="font-weight:400">Therefore, AHD treatment seems to be effective in preventing the onset and reducing the progression of dementia, but only for middle-aged hypertensive individuals with no baseline cognitive impairment.</span><span style="font-weight:400"> Here we review several longitudinal studies on the efficacy of AHD treatment in preventing cognitive decline in hypertensive patients. We then evaluate treatment outcomes in older individuals with baseline dementia compared to middle-aged individuals without baseline dementia. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the importance of blood pressure monitoring in relation to treatment success.</span>

<strong>Efficacy of AHD Treatment in Preventing Cognitive Decline</strong>

Several longitudinal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of AHD treatment, including ACE-inhibitors, diuretics, and beta-blockers, in preventing or reducing the progression of cognitive impairment in older individuals. In the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS), researchers found that men who were treated with beta-blockers had a significantly lower risk of developing cognitive impairment compared to those without treatment especially for men who had higher blood pressure at baseline (3). Similarly, the Gingko Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS) found an association between the use of diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease in participants with normal cognition at baseline (4). While HAAS and GEMS included participants without cognitive impairment at baseline, Kan et al. (2013) observed the effect of ACE-I use on 70-85 year old hypertensive patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease and found that individuals with treatment had slower progressions of cognitive decline compared to those without treatment. Findings from these studies highlight the potential of AHD treatment in preventing cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients as well as in reducing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with baseline dementia.

<strong>AHD Treatment in Oldest Old</strong>

Though the use of AHD treatment for cognitive impairment seems promising based on previous research, one major limitation of HAAS, GEMS, and the study by Kan et al. is the lack of information regarding participant blood pressure before, during and after treatment. The studies focused on the type and duration of AHD treatment and participants’ cognitive scores assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), but changes in individual blood pressure pre and post AHD treatment as well as variations in blood pressure trajectories between subjects were not examined (3, 4, 5). Because blood pressure trajectories vary across age, gender and in the presence of illnesses (6), failure in collecting this data possibly led researchers to overgeneralize or misinterpret the effects of AHD treatment for all hypertensive patients.

In fact, recent studies show that AHD treatments can actually harm a subgroup of the elderly. In this context, Mossello et al. (2015) investigated the effects of AHD therapy on hypertensive patients 85 years and older with baseline dementia or mild cognitive impairment. In contrast with Kan et al. (2013), researchers found low daytime systolic blood pressure associated with a greater progression of cognitive decline among those treated with AHDs (6). Additionally, individuals with higher systolic blood pressure had milder cognitive decline compared to those with lower systolic blood pressure and that this effect was greater for individuals with severe disabilities at baseline (6). These findings are consistent with those of the Leiden 85-Plus Study (2012) which found that higher systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure in the oldest old (85+ years) positively correlated with greater resilience to physical and cognitive decline, especially in individuals with pre-existing physical disabilities (8). Researchers postulate that, contrary to traditional medical belief, high blood pressure in later life serves as a compensatory mechanism to maintain organ perfusion (8) whereas low blood pressure leads to cerebral hypoperfusion that can damage neural tissue and increase the risk of dementia (7). The primary causes of low blood pressure are attributed to heart failure and/or drug treatment (7), but the spontaneous lowering of blood pressure is a pattern typically observed in older `individuals before the onset of dementia (6). Thus, for older patients with baseline cognitive impairment or physical disabilities, excessive blood pressuring lowering via AHD treatment may not only be ineffective in preventing dementia but also harmful to their cognitive health (6).

These studies (6, 7, 8) provide evidence of the limitations of AHD treatment for preventing dementia and emphasize the importance of measuring blood pressure and screening for pre-existing cognitive impairment before issuing AHD treatment. Additionally, the close monitoring of blood pressure during treatment is also equally as important. A daytime systolic blood pressure between 130 to 145 mmHg has been classified as the most appropriate therapeutic target of AHD treatment (6) where excessive blood pressure lowering (below 130 mmHg) may lead to negative outcomes (7).

<strong>AHD Treatment in Middle-Aged</strong>

Though AHD treatment has been shown to be ineffective and potentially harmful for older patients with cognitive impairment, several studies suggest its effectiveness for middle-aged hypertensive individuals. Gottesman et al. (2014) recruited hypertensive 50 year-old females and observed the effect of AHD treatment on their blood pressure trajectories biannually for 20 years. After two decades, researchers found that women with elevated blood pressure in midlife who received AHD treatment had better episodic memory than those who did not (9). Similarly, study by Joas et al. (2012), which assessed AHD treatment in Swedish women at a 37-year follow up, found that among hypertensive women without AHD treatment at midlife, higher baseline systolic blood pressure was linked to late-life dementia, especially AD (10).

Additionally, women with higher baseline systolic blood pressure who were treated with AHDs had the least cognitive decline, supporting claims of higher blood pressure in old age as a neuroprotective factor, which may have buffered the effects of excessive blood pressure lowering from over treatment (8). Furthermore, and consistent with the study by Mossello et al. which emphasizes the importance of baseline blood pressure in determining the efficacy of treatment, Joas et al. found that among those who were treated with AHD, women who developed dementia had lower baseline systolic blood pressure compared to those with higher baseline systolic pressure. Because blood pressure decreases spontaneously before the onset of dementia and is lower in individuals who manifest dementia compared with those who do not (6), AHD treatment may only be effective for those with extremely high blood pressure (9). Individuals at risk for hypertension may not benefit from AHD treatment as much those with extreme hypertension and may be better off reducing their risk of dementia with lifestyle modifications (10).

These findings emphasize the importance of detecting increased blood pressure in midlife and controlling blood pressure in those treated in efforts to maximize treatment benefits and prevent dementia in later life. Antihypertensive treatments have been shown to be successful in mediating the effects of midlife hypertension in individuals with higher systolic blood pressure, but less so in individuals with lower baseline systolic blood pressure, who may benefit more with lifestyle modifications.
<h3><strong>Future Directions</strong></h3>
<strong>Implications for Future Research</strong>

Because most studies of AHD treatment are observational, further randomized clinical trials are needed to determine causality (3), especially in populations at high risk for cognitive decline. In addition, increasing the duration of follow-up in longitudinal studies and frequency of blood pressure monitoring may provide us with a more holistic understanding of the relationship between blood pressure trajectories and cognition as they change with age (2). Also, variations in blood pressure trajectories across age, gender and the presence of illness emphasize the importance of homogenizing participant pools to differentiate the effects of AHD treatment on the basis of these factors (5). Furthermore, future studies investigating the biochemical mechanisms behind low blood pressure and cognitive impairment may guide pharmaceutical scientists and developers to make appropriate modifications to AHDs in hopes of increasing their efficacy (1).

<strong>Implications for Clinical Practice</strong>

Due to the negative relationship between low blood pressure and cognition, physicians should carefully consider blood pressure fluctuations and screen for signs of cognitive impairment before issuing AHD treatment to older patients (3). In addition, close blood pressure monitoring may be necessary to avoid high blood pressure overtreatment, if at all, in this population6. Lastly, given that individuals at risk for hypertension are currently not candidates for pharmacological interventions, doctors should encourage these patients to adopt lifestyle changes in an effort to reduce their risk of developing hypertension and of cognitive impairment (10).
<strong>Conclusions</strong>

AHD treatment seems to be effective in preventing the onset and reducing the progression of dementia, but only for middle-aged hypertensive individuals with no baseline cognitive impairment. Several longitudinal studies such as HAAS and GEMS demonstrate the potential of AHDs in reducing dementia in the elderly but their lack of blood pressure records make their findings hard to generalize across different populations (3,4) because blood pressure trajectories vary across age, gender, and in the presence of disease (8). Additionally, the importance of monitoring blood pressure was evident in a study that isolated the oldest old (85+) from other hypertensive individuals in the assessment of AHD efficacy, in which low blood pressure, baseline dementia and physical disability were associated with greater cognitive decline in conjunction with AHD treatment (6). Furthermore, an increase in blood pressure in middle age was classified as the biggest predictor of late-life dementia (10), whereas higher blood pressure exhibited a neuroprotective effect in older individuals (7,8). Though further research on specific populations is needed, targeting midlife hypertension while closely monitoring blood pressure seems promising in the prevention of dementia.

<strong>Author's Note:</strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px">"This piece aspires to encourage consumers to critically interpret the scientific facts presented in everyday advertisements. Our society assumes that rBST and many other synthetic chemicals are detrimental to health, this essay emphasizes the importance of challenging fallacious argument in order to fairly evaluate the use of rBST."</p>
<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight:400">As the United States is becoming increasingly concerned with how food is produced and the effects of artificial substance addition, certain production methods are being scrutinized. In particular, methods of milk production in cows have been criticized for increased artificial hormone use and studied with seemingly inconclusive findings.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Notably, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST), a synthetic growth hormone used to increase milk production in cows, is a popular target of this scrutiny because of the concern that increased hormone consumption will interfere with human hormone chemical signaling. This rbST is almost identical to the naturally occurring growth hormone in cows, but its effects on cows are not yet ascertained.</span><span style="font-weight:400">1</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">To illustrate, several countries have gone so far as to ban its use because of the unknown hormonal interaction it is thought to cause. RbST is associated with an increased risk of mastitis, an infection of a cow’s udder, which is commonly treated with antibiotics. From a study done on a sample of 1,128 cows collected from 28 different herds and 4 geographical regions, cows treated with rbST had a 23% increase in antibiotics use compared to untreated cows.</span><span style="font-weight:400">1</span><span style="font-weight:400"> This increase in antibiotic treatments caused scientists to question if rbST caused an increase in antibiotic residues in milk since rbST was introduced in 1994. The result of this study is alarming because over the past twenty years, more than 35 million cows were treated with rbST in the United States, and results of increased presence of antibiotics in milk has been linked to increased risk of breast, colon, and prostate cancer.</span><span style="font-weight:400">3</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Contrary to the results of milk quality in the antibiotic study, another way to test milk quality is to test somatic cell count (SCC), which is the number of white blood cells per milliliter of milk. SCC is a good indicator of cow health and milk quality because an increase in somatic cells is a response to pathogens. The legal maximum SCC count in the European Union, Canada, and Australia is 400,000 cells/mL, while the United States allows an SCC that is 87.5% higher, at 750,000 cells/mL. The USDA has shown a decrease in the average SCC in the United States from 1998 to 2009. This decrease in SCC shows that pathogens in the milk produced in the United States has gone down since 1998. Although this data seemingly supports that quality is associated with rbST, it is important to note that correlation alone is not enough to support that rbST was the factor that improved milk quality. Such improvement in milk quality since rbST’s introduction is very possibly a result of increased regulations and the implementation of new technology in milk production.</span><span style="font-weight:400">1</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Ultimately, the studies on the effects of rbST, taken together, are not fully conclusive, but might support that rbST growth hormone may be deleterious to human health by potentially increasing risk of breast, colon, and prostate cancer. In conclusion, there are many ways to test the quality of milk through somatic cell count in response to pathogens, and increase in antibiotics residue. Scientists much look at various results together to get a good understanding of  rbST growth hormone’s risk on human health. The United States’ widespread use of rbST necessitates further research to determine the magnitude to which rbST’s increased risk of mastitis in cows affects cow health. </span>

<strong>Author's Note:</strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px">“What is Myasthenia Gravis?” aims at informing the readers about the mechanism of action, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of Myasthenia Gravis. Fatigue and muscle weakness is something that today’s working population has learned to ignore, and this has prevented MG from early detection. Proper treatment is necessary for this potentially life-threatening condition. I decided to write about this topic after reading a case study for one of my internships. I hope the readers will look out for signs like the drooping of eyelids, muscle weakness, and difficulty in swallowing for the early detection of this rare autoimmune disease."</p>
<!--more-->

Myasthenia gravis (MG), “grave muscle weakness” in Greek, is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disease in which the body’s defense mechanism goes awry and attacks its own cells. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, patients with MG complain of varying degrees of worsening muscle weakness in different parts of the body, such as in one or both eyes, face, or limbs. If the condition affects respiratory muscles, it can cause airway obstruction, which can lead to a life-threatening situation called myasthenia crisis (2015). Understanding MG’s mechanism of action, symptoms, and diagnosis can vastly improve the prognosis of this disease.

Usually, our immune system protects us from foreign elements that enter our bodies by creating “soldiers” called antibodies to destroy these elements. During human development, these antibodies undergo a kind of orientation wherein they are trained to recognize self from nonself proteins. A selection process at the end of this session eliminates the antibodies that react strongly with self proteins (Berg 2002). However, in rare cases such as MG, the immune system fails to successfully undergo this process and produces antibodies against its own cells, causing autoimmunity (NLM 2015).

<a href="http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2016/03/bhatt.png" rel="attachment wp-att-718"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-718" src="http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2016/03/bhatt.png" alt="Bhatt" width="474" height="233" /></a>
<p style="text-align:right"><em>Picture Courtesy of MA</em></p>
The autoimmunity in MG affects the receptors in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), or the space between nervous cells and the muscles they control. As the nerve impulse travels down a normal neuronal cell, it communicates by releasing acetylcholine (ACh), a chemical messenger called a neurotransmitter, into the NMJ. ACh then binds to complementary receptors called acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the adjoining cell. Upon the binding of these chemicals at the receptors, a desired effect is produced, which can lead to further propagation of the impulse to another neuron and eventually cause muscular movement. In MG, the body’s defense system, which usually produces antibodies against foreign elements, makes antibodies against its own cells that bind to cell-specific receptors. This prevents the binding of ACh to the receptors as shown in the figure and leads to their further internalization and subsequent degradation. Consequently, the message is not passed from the cell, resulting in either weakened or no muscle contraction (NINDS 2015). It is, therefore, of prime importance to detect the symptoms resulting from the reduced availability of these receptors at the NMJ for a better prognosis.

MG can be difficult to diagnose definitively, as its initial symptoms are similar to other plausible autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the patient’s symptoms should be analyzed for an accurate MG diagnosis as, in most cases, the onset of the disorder is sudden and is not always a tell-tale myasthenia gravis case. MG is characterized by the decay in muscle strength after use and improvement upon rest. The first noticeable symptoms include the drooping of eyelids (ptosis) and double vision (diplopia). Generalized myasthenia, or weakness all over the body, develops in patients within three years if they initially experience trouble with ocular (eye) muscles (Rubin 2014). Additional symptoms include an unstable gait, a change in facial expression, difficulty chewing and swallowing, shortness of breath, and weakness in the limbs, fingers, and neck. While the symptoms are usually well managed and patients can live comfortably, early detection is key because it can prevent the condition from exacerbating (NINDS 2015).

One of the preliminary ways to diagnose MG is to check for disruption in eye movements or muscle strength. These changes in eye movement and muscle strength can occur without altering the patient’s sensitivity to touch. This occurs because MG is an isolated neuromuscular disease, a disease that does not affect any other system like the sensory system. A more quantifiable way of diagnosing is performing a special blood test to detect AChR antibodies in the blood sample. This test is of high validity, as 80-90% of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis test positive (Rubin 2014). Moreover, the specificity of this test significantly decreases in the absence of ocular symptoms. In another test called electromyography, a repetitive electrical impulse is given to the affected muscle. In 60% of the patients with myasthenia gravis, the muscle response will dissipate over time; that is, the patients’ response to the electrical stimulus will lessen progressively (Rubin 2014). Occasionally, another test is performed during which a drug called edrophonium is administered. If a patient is positive for MG, edrophonium relieves activity-induced muscle fatigue. Nonetheless, this result can be seen in patients with other neurological conditions as well, or if performed in patients without droopy eyelids. A follow-up CT or MRI scan should be performed to check for thymus enlargement, a condition called thymic hyperplasia, prevalent in 65% of MG patients (Rubin 2014). While doctors can utilize various tests to diagnose MG, these tests may provide non-specific results, and thus, more than one test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

It is estimated that only 1 in 5,000 Americans are affected by MG, but the actual number may be higher due to the fact that many individuals may be undiagnosed until they reach advanced stages (Juel and Massey 2007). Even though the disease can occur at any age and to anyone, it is more common among women under 40 and men above 60 years of age (NINDS 2015). It is, therefore, essential to have an unambiguous early diagnosis in order to follow-up with proper treatment, as the condition may eventually affect the respiratory muscles, causing airway obstruction.

While there is no known medication for treating the autoimmunity caused by the immune system attacking the ACh receptors, drugs that help manage symptoms are typically prescribed. A class of drugs called anticholinestrase helps relieve symptoms by increasing the duration and availability of ACh in the NMJ and preventing its enzymatic breakdown by acetylcholinestrase. Additionally, steroids are prescribed to suppress the patient’s immune system, reducing the production of antibodies that might target patients’ own cells. However, when taking steroids, caution has to be taken because the patient becomes more vulnerable to other garden variety diseases like the common cold and strep throat, which are otherwise preventable by an intact immune system. Finally, a procedure called thymectomy, or the surgical removal of the thymus gland, can be performed, and it has shown both permanent and temporary improvement in 80% of the cases of MG (Rubin 2014).

Even though MG is a potentially fatal autoimmune disease, it is not as “grave” as it used to be. The latest technological advancements in diagnoses and treatments has made the term “gravis” redundant or unnecessary in MG, with patients having a normal life expectancy after appropriate care (NINDS 2015). Since the symptoms are similar to many other neurological disorders like muscular sclerosis and muscular dystrophy, emphasis should be given to early and accurate diagnosis for effective disease remission. In my opinion, individuals should undergo at least two tests to accurately confirm MG and avoid a false positive. An AChR antibody test could be used, since it is an indicator of an autoimmune disease, and an electromyography test could be administered, since it indicates a neuromuscular disorder. This condition is a good example of how our defense systems can malfunction and cause serious damage to the functioning of our bodies.

<strong>Author's Note:</strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="font-weight:400">"I am pursing a career in pediatrics and wanted to familiarize myself with new research regarding health and development of children. I was amazed at the advancements of medical technology which allow us to understand diseases and create potential cures, previously never thought possible. My purpose for writing this review is to show scientific audiences the most current research on how bacteria in the respiratory microbiome has an impact on asthma. Recently, much research initiated by the Human Microbiome Projects (HMP) proved that the bacteria living on and inside humans contribute to the health and disease of the body. This review is meant to educate scientists on the most recent information on development of childhood asthma and prompt others to conduct future research on preventative treatments for the disease."</span></p>
<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight:400">An uncontrollable coughing and heavy wheezing fit may seem all too familiar to those with severe asthma. Childhood asthma impacts millions of children and their families, and the majority of children who develop asthma do so before the age of five (aaaai.org). The US Department of Health and Human Services defines asthma as an inflammatory disease of the airways with generally reversible airflow obstruction and increased sensitivity of the throat muscles (Earl).  </span><span style="font-weight:400">Asthma symptoms include: breathing problems, intense coughing or wheezing, and chronic respiratory infections</span><span style="font-weight:400"> (Earl).</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Lung tissue inflammation, due to environmental, immunological, or genetic factors, can be the cause of serious asthma (aaaai.org). However, recent studies have identified another serious cause of asthma: “the bacteria living in the nasal passages, throat, and lungs.” Bacteria living in a certain area of the body is referred to as a microbiota, and its composition at each location on body is distinct (Versalovic). For example, the bacteria that live in the throat and lungs, comprising the respiratory microbiota, cannot thrive nor live in the kidneys or skin. Harmful bacteria may get trapped in the respiratory microbiota and cause an inflammatory response of the cell tissues and muscles in the throat and lungs (Versalovic). A better understanding of the disease has been reached due to new medical insights that have linked respiratory microbiota during infancy to the development of severe childhood asthma and chronic breathing problems later on in life (Teo).</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">The formation of a microbiota occurs during an infant’s first year of life, similar to how an immune system develops. The immediate surroundings have a large impact on the baby because both the good and bad bacteria will essentially colonize inside and outside the body. It is common for many infants to get sick or develop respiratory infections, often from harmful microbes, or tiny bacteria, that get trapped in the part of the throat that connects to the nose (Teo). Infections during infancy that spread from the throat to lower respiratory airways and lungs can lead to development of asthma later on in life (Teo). Problems such as bacterial respiratory tract infections during infancy have a strong association with worsening or increased severity of symptoms in children with asthma (Earl). </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Now scientists are realizing asthma can be caused by the bacteria living in your throat. </span><span style="font-weight:400">The Childhood Asthma Study (CAS), an investigation of the respiratory microbiome during the first year of life for a cohort of 234 children, correlated bacteria and asthma development. </span><span style="font-weight:400">The trial came to this conclusion by tracking infants with both respiratory infections and breathing problems and looking at their throat bacteria collected from a cotton swab (Teo).  Results showed different types of bacteria living in a healthy throat versus a sick asthma throat (ibid). The majority of all the affected children contained a harmful throat bacteria called Streptococcus (ibid). In addition, the majority of all the healthy children contained a beneficial throat bacteria called Moraxella, which was significantly absent in the sick throats (ibid). Based on this trial, Moraxella may play a protective role in the throat, and if absent, can lead to negative impacts and colonization of  harmful bacteria like Streptococcus (ibid). The harmful Strep bacteria indicates a strong asthma predictor because those infants developed mild to severe breathing problems within the next 6 months (ibid). Thus, the types of bacteria living in the respiratory microbiota can contribute to the nature of infections and inflammatory responses  seen in asthma (Earl). </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), initiated in 2008, caused a surge in research about how the tiny organisms living on and inside humans can affect the body in health and disease, such as throat bacteria and its impact on asthma. Funding of this project advanced technology in order to detect and code bacterial DNA, known as genetic sequencing. In a recent pediatric asthma study, the effects of the respiratory microbiota on asthma was determined by genetically sequencing bacteria in both healthy and sick airways, and then comparing the DNA (Versalovic). Broad results showed the bacteria in asthma airways differed from bacteria in healthy airways (ibid). However, upon further investigation of the bacteria by comparing their DNA through genetic sequencing, it was determined that the harmful and beneficial bacteria were very closely related (ibid). This result signifies that such minute differences in DNA can have such a large impact on how the bacteria contributes to the respiratory microbiota, whether it be positive or negative. The results of this study indicate future research on possible asthma treatments is needed to determine how to carefully isolate harmful bacteria from the throat, without disturbing the closely related beneficial bacteria (ibid). </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Asthma was previously understood as a disease due to genetic or environmental factors, however now scientists realize that it is caused by the bacteria living in your throat. The new research and biology behind the development of the disease will allow scientists to properly understand childhood asthma. The unique approach of changing or isolating the bacteria living in the respiratory microbiota as a treatment plan may impact numerous children and their families dealing with the asthma disease.</span>

<strong>Author's Note: </strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px">"Parnya and I collaborated on this piece for a Science and Religion: The Case of Galileo seminar assignment. This assignment was inspired by the seminar's focus on religious controversies surrounding scientific advancements, theories, and concepts. Another main reason why we wrote this piece is because of our backgrounds. Parnya, a computer engineer major, and myself, a biology major, both attended Catholic high schools. We enjoyed writing this piece because analyzing science and technology in the face of religious teachings and practice is something we will have to consider in our future careers. We chose to analyze abortion because it is one of the most popular and controversial science vs religion topics today. After reading this piece, we would like our readers to understand that while science can heal and cure, it can also offend and upset religious groups. As college students studying science, it is our job to develop our own opinions, while respecting those whose beliefs differ from our own."</p>

<span style="font-weight:400">Throughout history, stem cells have become one of the most intriguing scientific discoveries because of their ability to save lives and to improve the health industry. They were first discovered in 1961, when </span><span style="font-weight:400">Drs. James Till, a biophysicist, and Ernest McCulloch, a hematologist, published accidental findings in “Radiation Research” that proved the existence of stem cells (Stem Cell History). Stem cells are a promising scientific discovery and can be used to help improve many health conditions, including spinal cord injuries, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, lung diseases, and arthritis (Lyon). They are also unique in that they are unlike any other cell in the body. Stem cells are described as unspecialized cells that can renew themselves through cell division and under certain experimental conditions, they can be induced to become tissue or organ specific cells with special functions (Stem Cell Information). There is no doubt that stem cells are useful in improving medicine and health. However, they have also shown to cause controversy, especially amongst religious groups, who question the ethics behind stem cell use. Because stem cells can be taken from any tissue in the body, as well as a human embryo, stem cell use has been both favored and disfavored by a variety of religious groups who have different beliefs regarding the value of a human embryo. It is important to understand these different religious views because scientific research often creates broader implications beyond its improvement of one’s health. Therefore, when making scientific decisions regarding disease treatment and management, scientists and health professionals should also consider and evaluate their decisions in a wider context outside the medical field.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">It is important to understand both what makes stem cells unique and their significance in scientific research in order to assess their impact on both the scientific and religious communities.  The two main types of stem cells are embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells, or stoma cells. While the adult stem cells reside in a “stem cell niche,” or a specific area of each tissue, the embryonic stem cells are found in the preimplantation stage of an embryo, the stage in which the embryo has not yet implanted in the wall of the uterus (Stem Cell Information). At this point, fertilization has already occurred and the embryo is undergoing multiple stages of development. In fact, the embryonic stem cells are specifically extracted from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which is a fertilized egg four days after conception (Reaves). The embryos used in stem cell research are fertilized in a special way; the</span><span style="font-weight:400"> embryos used for research are fertilized in vitro, or outside the woman’s body, and are donated for research purposes with the consent of the donor (Stem Cell History). Therefore, the donor theoretically has knowledge of how the embryo will be used and has agreed to the use of the embryo for the improvement of scientific research. Furthermore, </span><span style="font-weight:400">scientists have learned that these embryonic stem cells are also pluripotent; they have the capability to differentiate into any type of cell (Murnaghan).They are also more favorable in research because they possess special qualities that adult stem cells do not have. Important adult stem cells can only differentiate into the type of cells in the tissue where they are found and embryonic stem cells are fresher and younger and can be grown in the laboratory more easily (Murnaghan). For these reasons, embryonic stem cells are highly valued by the scientific community as being important for scientific advancements, thus they are also a target for many religious groups who have different beliefs about human embryos. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Embryonic stem cell research has developed into an ethical debate concerning the creation, treatment, and destruction of human embryos. For example, under the Christian faith, Catholics share a moral objection, rooted in the belief that the fertilized egg is a representation of potential human life. Catholics, many of whom are pro-life, disprove of stem cell research because they are concerned with the rights and status of the embryo as an early aged human life form. They believe harvested embryonic stem cells are human beings and extracting these cells and destroying the embryo constitutes murder (Vestal). The way in which Catholics view embryonic stem cell research is similar to the way in which they view abortion; in both cases, Catholics believe in the preservation of human life and that human life begins at conception. In his 1995 encyclical, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Gospel of Life</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, the late Pope John Paul II wrote, “Human embryos obtained in vitro are human beings and are subjects with rights; their dignity and right to life must be respected from the first moment of their existence…”  Therefore, within the church, human life is sacred, precious, and inviolable the moment the sperm fertilizes an egg cell. Moreover, an examination of the Bible illustrates that Catholics believe that at the moment of conception, the potential human person is granted a spiritual soul that it is in God’s “care even before [birth]”(Isaiah 44:2) and “present with the Lord”(2 Cor. 5:8) after death. The idea of stem cell research points to concerns about when human life begins. Catholics believe it begins at conception, yet other religious groups believe otherwise and therefore favor stem cell research.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Stem cell research has developed into a controversial debate amongst other monotheistic and polytheistic religions, some of which even support embryonic stem cell research. Under the Christian faith, the Episcopal Church, for example, has declared itself in favor of stem cell research as long as the embryos used would have been destroyed otherwise (The Pew Forum). Similarly, the Presbyterian Church in the United States reaffirmed its position in favor of stem cell research that is intended to “restore health to the suffering.”(The Pew Forum). Although both Catholicism and these faiths worship Christ, they do not agree on the ethical viewpoints regarding embryonic stem cell research. Followers of other monotheistic religions, such as Islam, have no explicit ruling on this issue and they tend to have mixed viewpoints. Some individuals of the Islamic faith believe embryos do not have souls while others believe the termination of an embryo is morally impermissible (The Pew Forum). Furthermore, Judaism supports embryonic stem cell research as long as it is used for medical purposes. Rabbi Levi Yitschak Halperin of the Institute for Science and Jewish Law states, “As long as it has not been implanted in the womb and it is still a frozen fertilized egg, it does not have the status of an embryo at all and there is no prohibition to destroy it...” (The Pew Forum) Lastly, both Hinduism and Buddhism do not directly address the issue. Buddhists, however, refer to two teachings: the prohibition against harming others and the pursuit of knowledge. Therefore, some believers argue that stem cell research is in accordance to a request for knowledge, while other states that it violates the notion of harming others (The Pew Forum). Different religion groups uphold their own unique beliefs on stem cell research, allowing an individual to develop his or her own personal perspective concerning the subject. However, it is also important to note that perhaps stem cells do not have to be taken from human embryos. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">In the movie, “Cutting Through the Spin,” Reverend Dr. Tadeusz Pacholczyk, a priest of the diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts and a PhD graduate with a neuroscience degree from Yale, discusses the science and ethics of stem cell research, providing evidence for a solution. He argues the idea that stem cells can be extracted from fetuses, umbilical cords, placentas, bone marrow, and even cadavers. In other words, there are ways to use stem cells without extracting them from a human embryo. He states that thousands of patients have been cured of their respective diseases with the use of umbilical cord stem cells, for example. A patient with Krabbe’s disease was cured after umbilical cord stem cells were able to create the patient’s missing enzyme. In another case, bone marrow stem cells were put into a patient’s damaged heart muscle and were able to repair the scar. These particular cases show evidence that embryonic stem cells do not necessarily have to be used. The belief that embryonic stem cells are the most promising is quite plausibly a myth. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Scientists must continue to use stem cells from alternate sources in the human body and religious advocates must keep an open mind, so as to allow scientific innovation and exploration to improve the health of society. Those who support the study of stem cells do not necessarily oppose religious beliefs, but rather they have their own unique viewpoints and above all else, support the probable cures that may exist for fatal diseases. In contrast to the Christian faith, in which members believe that life begins at conception, supporters of stem cell research and biologists state that a human individual begins to develop at the primitive-streak formation, which appears fourteen days after embryonic development (Lee, George). These different viewpoints on when human life begins, in addition to other religious beliefs regarding self-harm and preservation (Buddhism), or “restoring life to the suffering” (Presbyterian Church) should all be taken into consideration when making scientific advancements with the use of stem cells. There should also be more research conducted to improve the success of stem cells that are not taken from human embryos .Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson’s, states, "Let’s help people. Let's use that to save lives." Stem cells have become important for people’s survival and this principle should not be overlooked in order to ensure that people can lead healthy lives. </span>

<strong>Author's Note:</strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px">"This narrative case report describes an athlete’s shoulder injury and explores the way injuries are treated in the world of collegiate athletics. While I was writing this piece, I recognized just how little time non-athletes spend thinking about the impact of sports injuries. Many NCAA athletes have life-long sports injuries, but we rarely talk about this issue as a campus community. There's a national discourse revolving around injury prevention in football, and I believe this is a topic college students (athletes and non-athletes alike) should be thinking critically about."</p>
<!--more-->

On a sunny October afternoon in 2012, Coolidge Evans, running back for an NCAA Division I football team, stepped on the field with a smile on his face. His team had traveled to South Dakota to play South Dakota State, and he was starting for the first time. A football player since the age of 6, Coolidge was always in tune with the vibe of the field before a game. On this particular day, he could tell he was about to <em>“go off</em>”. “‘Go off’ basically means I had full composure and control of the game,” Coolidge explains.

A sophomore at the time, Coolidge was excited to play well and make his parents (who had traveled from California to see him) proud. The players were running the spread offense, which is Coolidge’s favorite play. He had experience with this play in high school, so he knew exactly what he needed to do. Coolidge knew that the defense was aggressive and would act on quick assumptions, so he successfully tricked the defense by going left and breaking into the open field ahead of him. The safety tackled him as he was running, and he fell to the ground. “I was moving the ball but then I was like ‘Ah, this is all bad,’” Coolidge recalls. Instead of bracing for the impact, Coolidge relaxed his body as he came down to the ground.

Lying on the ground in a state of shock, Coolidge couldn’t feel anything. He was on the ground for all but a couple of seconds, though, and found that he could get up without any help. He told the physical trainers on the sideline that his shoulder didn’t feel normal. He wanted the trainers to cut through his jersey and remove his shoulder pads to get a good look at his shoulder. The physical trainers refused, despite the fact that his shoulder was clearly causing him pain. The trainers gave Coolidge some painkillers and he sat out for the rest of the game. Coolidge left the field to shower and put his arm in a basic sling. He was later given ice for his shoulder. He was in pain on the bus ride from the stadium and on the flight home. “Sleeping on that plane was the most uncomfortable sleep I’ve ever had,” Coolidge recalls.

<hr />

Coolidge had injured his acromioclavicular (AC) joint during the game. The AC joint is located between the clavicle and the scapula. While the AC joint is strong, its location makes it vulnerable to injury from direct trauma (Koehler et al. 2015). The muscles that attach to the bones in this region rotate, flex, and extend the arm. In American football, shoulder injuries account for 10% to 20% of all musculoskeletal injuries, and in a cohort of intercollegiate football players, AC joint injuries accounted for 41% of all shoulder injuries (Lynch et al. 2013). The prevalence of these injuries comes as no surprise; football players are constantly tackled on the field and are given little time to recover, and these injuries are diagnosed and treated with a nonchalance that is quite commonplace in the field of athletics.

<hr />

When he returned home, Coolidge realized just how much he needed his shoulder for daily tasks. Showering, wearing a backpack, and driving his manual car proved to be difficult with his impaired shoulder. Coolidge accommodated for this by using his good arm. Physical trainers said he had a third-degree AC separation, but that he would be fine. “In football language, ‘fine’ means ‘good enough to play,’” Coolidge clarifies. A third-degree AC separation refers to the complete dislocation of the joint between the shoulder blade and collarbone, an injury so severe that it can result in a permanently deformed shoulder.

Before heading out to practice, Coolidge would get an air cushion taped around his shoulder and his shoulder pads would be placed on top. The physical trainers recommended that Coolidge do weekly physical therapy, but he felt like they were downplaying his injury. He was still in pain, but for a month and a half, he tried to convince himself that he was okay.

<hr />

If a player’s injuries are not properly treated, players might have to face the physical and mental burden of dealing with serious complications. Dr. Danielle Campagne, an emergency medicine physician, states that these complications may threaten life or limb viability or cause permanent limb dysfunction (Campagne, 2014). This may sound overly dramatic for a fairly common sports injury, but failing to let an injured joint properly heal can greatly increase the risk of permanent damage. Joint injuries can disrupt neurovascular structures in the body. Blood vessels and nerves from the hand and arm drain into a main artery and nerve plexus (respectively), both of which are located in the shoulder region, so an injury in this area can be especially debilitating. Long-term complications can result in general joint instability, torn ligaments, or fractured bones. In most cases, a physical examination will be done, x-rays will be taken of the affected area and, if the injury is deemed mild, the patient will be sent home with a list of rehabilitative arm exercises. In more serious cases, an MRI scan will be administered and surgery may be necessary.

<hr />

One weekend, Coolidge flew to Los Angeles and got an MRI scan through his personal physician. The MRI scan confirmed that he had a torn labrum in addition to the third-degree AC separation. A labrum tear refers to a rupture of the cartilage that stabilizes the shoulder joint, and it is a common injury for athletes who engage in tackle sports. His shoulder was, as athletes call it, “blown”. He returned to campus and showed the physical trainers his MRI results. They agreed that surgery was necessary. Throughout December of that year, Coolidge did not train with the football team, but instead took time off to let his shoulder heal.

Coolidge went in for shoulder reconstruction surgery the following January. The ligament of his left clavicle bone and the tendons of his left bicep were reattached to his scapula. His torn labrum was reattached to his shoulder socket with sutures. He was prescribed Vicodin for the pain and his healing shoulder was encased in a heavy duty sling for four months. Two months after the surgery, he began daily rehabilitative exercises. He continued to do physical therapy with an athletic trainer for the rest of the year.

<hr />

Anywhere from 11% to 81% of student athletes will sustain an injury over the course of their football careers (Dragoo et al. 2012). Only 3.6% of AC joint injuries are diagnosed as severe enough to require surgery. In a retrospective study that assessed the pathology of AC injuries in NFL players, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Bryan Kelly states, “Surgery has rarely been necessary. We have treated several NFL quarterbacks non-operatively.” Dr. Kelly does go on to mention that more serious cases will need surgical treatment (Kelly et al. 2004). Surgery and post-operative care are both time-intensive and costly. The process can be emotionally jarring for student-athletes specifically, many of whom want to simply get playing time on the field. Recovering from a severe injury can also affect other aspects of a student-athlete’s life; balancing academic responsibilities in addition to physical rehabilitation may prove to be too much to handle.

In more recent years, there has been a bigger push to prevent football players from having to deal with the physical pain and mental burden of injuries. Researchers have analyzed extensive databases containing injury diagnoses of NFL and NCAA athletes. In a study that assesses data from the NCAA Injury Surveillance System, Dr. Jason Dragoo and his colleagues found that rates of AC joint injuries are 11 times greater during football games than during practices (Dragoo et al. 2012). The study posits that game conditions are less predictable and produce heightened speeds and intensity, which contribute to an increased risk of injury (Dragoo et al. 2012). Reevaluating how players train and how injuries are treated might lead to a lower incidence of these severe injuries occurring during games. Results from injury prevention trials in other sports show that a structured and progressive warm-up can help prevent general sports injuries, but there is a lack of research that assesses the effectiveness of this training tactic in football specifically (Kirkendall et al. 2010). As far as treating joint injuries, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons suggests that the player must have no pain, no swelling, a full range of motion, and normal strength before returning to play (AAOS 2013).

Football players look practically superhuman on the field. That’s why fans enter stadiums in droves to support their favorite players. Unfortunately, many fans do not know how common it is for players with sustained injuries to continue playing when they shouldn’t. Football players might seem indestructible, but it is crucial to remember that, even in all their might, they have very vulnerable and fragile bodies.

By the end of the year, Coolidge felt like he had fully recovered. He remained on the team and continued playing football for two more years. Now, at twenty-two and still as athletic as ever, Coolidge appears to be in good health. When asked what triggers his shoulder pain he pauses for a moment and mumbles, “Thinking about it triggers the pain.” He says he doesn’t even like touching the scar. When asked if he feels like his shoulder is back to normal he responds, “No, but it’s a new normal.”

As the most common headache, tension-type headache (TTH) affects approximately 80 percent of the population annually and is the second-most prevalent disorder in the world (Taylor 2016a). TTH is characterized by generalized, nonthrobbing pain in the absence of migraine-induced incapacity, nausea, or photophobia. Tension-type headache normally produces mild to moderate pain often described as viselike. It originates bilaterally in the occipital or frontal lobes and extends to the rest of the brain. TTH occasionally causes unilateral or pulsating pain. Two prominent features distinguish TTH from migraine. First, TTH does not lead to nausea and vomiting. Second, it is not made worse by physical activity, light, sounds, or smells (Silberstein 2014).

<b>Classification</b>

There are two types of TTH categorized by attack frequency: episodic TTH refers to the condition in which patients suffer headaches at a rate of less than 15 headache days a month, and chronic TTH involves 15 or more headache days a month. Both types may contribute to significant disability, especially when patients also suffer from migraine, comorbid depression, or anxiety (Taylor 2016b). Episodic TTH is further broken down to two subtypes: frequent episodic (1 to 14 headache days per month) and infrequent episodic (less than 1 headache day per month). The duration of episodic headaches ranges from half an hour to several days. Episodic TTH typically starts several hours after waking and increases in intensity as the day progresses. The pain intensity associated with this type of TTH is rarely sufficient to disrupt sleep. Chronic TTH can be triggered by sleep disturbances, stress, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, neck pain, and eyestrain (Silberstein 2014). This type of TTH varies in intensity throughout the day but is almost always present.

The classification of these three types of TTH is critical, as each has its own distinct underlying pathophysiology, influence on daily functioning, and treatment methods. For example, peripheral mechanisms are more closely associated with episodic TTH, while central mechanisms are more relevant in chronic TTH. More specifically, the development of episodic TTH is contingent upon the peripheral activation or sensitization of myofascial nociceptors, whereas the transition from episodic to chronic TTH relies on the sensitization of pain pathways in the central nervous system established through prolonged exposure to nociceptive stimuli from pericranial myofascial tissues (Bendtsen et al. 2015). With regard to the treatment of these different types of TTH, infrequent episodic TTH usually calls for an acute symptomatic approach, while frequent episodic TTH and chronic TTH require prophylactic interventions. Each type of TTH can be additionally sorted based on the concurrent presence or absence of pericranial muscle tenderness.

Neurologic consultation normally only follows lengthy experience of headaches. In particular, TTH is the most prevalent type of primary headache in the general population. Despite the overall high prevalence of TTH, most patients with TTH have the infrequent episodic subtype. Some physicians argue that this type of TTH is not a disease. Instead, they regard it as a normal phenomenon that does not call for medical attention. Since most individuals with TTH have infrequent, mild headaches, only a small percentage of the affected population seek medical care to address such condition. Women have a slightly higher probability of experiencing TTH than men. This asymmetry is especially conspicuous in frequent episodic and chronic tension-type headaches.

Tension-type headache was previously known by different names, including stress or tension headache, muscle-contraction headache, psychomyogenic headache, and psychogenic headache (Taylor 2016a). The term tension was initially chosen to reflect tension headache’s suspected etiology: excessive stress or tension leading to muscle contraction. Traditionally, it was thought that sustained contracture of pericranial muscles causes TTH, though the notion is no longer accepted.

<b>Pathophysiology</b>

Although the precise mechanisms through which TTH develops remain unknown, the pathogenesis of TTH most likely involves multiple factors. Different factors have varying degrees of influence over the development of TTH, depending on the type. For example, environment plays a greater role in the development of episodic TTH than chronic TTH. In contrast, genetic factors have more of an impact on the development of chronic TTH than episodic TTH. Nitric oxide has been identified as a potential molecular trigger for pain associated with TTH. Tension-type headache’s underlying pain mechanisms are likely dynamic to account for the observed diversity in frequency and intensity of headache attacks. They vary not only between individuals, but also within individuals over time from one attack to the next.

<b>Diagnosis</b>

The diagnosis of TTH is reached through a clinical evaluation consisting of symptoms assessment and a physical examination that includes a neurologic examination. There are no diagnostic tests specific for TTH. During the evaluation, effort is made to identify potential triggers for chronic tension-type headache in order to devise targeted treatment plans. In addition, practitioners look out for differences that set TTH apart from a forme fruste of migraine to avoid misdiagnosis. These headaches possess certain features of migraine and certain features of tension-type headache, but they differ from TTH in their responsiveness to migraine-specific drugs. Physicians should be cautious about diagnosing severe headaches as TTH, because severe tension-type headaches are rare. Due to extensive symptom overlap between TTH and secondary headaches, it is essential for doctors to closely observe the temporal pattern of headaches to reach an accurate diagnosis.

Patients with TTH usually have normal results from physical and neurologic examinations, blood work, brain imaging with CT or MRI scans, and spinal fluid analyses (Taylor 2016a). The most prominent abnormal finding in patients with TTH is increased pericranial muscle tenderness, or muscle tenderness in the head, neck, or shoulders. Pericranial muscle tenderness acts as a signal for the intensity and frequency of TTH attacks and generally worsens during a headache. The presence or absence of pericranial muscle tenderness can be discerned through an examination by manual palpation. Manual palpation describes the application of firm pressure with the second and third fingers making small rotating movements on the pericranial muscles, including the frontal, temporal, masseter, pterygoid, sternocleidomastoid, splenius, and trapezius muscles (Taylor 2016a).

Because pure TTH is a rather featureless headache, practitioners need to be attentive of all possible diagnoses when examining a patient. In particular, physicians encounter diagnostic challenges when patients present with atypical or missing symptoms, symptoms that overlap with other types of headaches, or an incomplete self-report of symptoms. When a patient with a normal physical examination displays a stable pattern of episodic and disabling headaches, practitioners should consider the diagnosis of migraine if there is no evidence that suggests otherwise.

Another condition that closely resembles TTH is brain tumor headache, though it is rarer. Its features are typically nonspecific and dependent upon tumor location, size, and rate of growth (Taylor 2016a). Brain tumor headache is generally bilateral though it can be restricted to the side of the tumor. A third type of headache that shares similar features with TTH is medication overuse headache (MOH). MOH is a secondary headache that normally results from treating an episodic headache disorder such as TTH with frequent and excessive amounts of acute symptomatic medications. Therefore, practitioners should suspect MOH in patients who adopt a pharmacologic approach to treatment. For patients with unilateral pain, cervicogenic headache is a probable diagnosis. Pain from cervicogenic headache ranges from moderate to severe intensity and radiates from occipital to frontal regions. It can be exacerbated by head movements and is nonlancinating.

<b>Treatment and Prevention</b>

Treatment of TTH consists of two major components: analgesics, and behavioral and psychologic interventions. Additionally, some drugs used to prevent migraine such as amitriptyline are also effective in preventing chronic tension-type headache (Silberstein 2014). For most cases of tension-type headaches, over-the-counter analgesics such as aspirin and acetaminophen provide significant relief. Behavioral and psychologic interventions involve relaxation and stress management techniques. These treatment methods are especially potent when used in conjunction with drug therapy.

Patients with frequent episodic or chronic TTH should consider preventive treatment as a way to alleviate disabling pain. Preventive treatment of TTH involves both drugs and nonpharmacologic approaches such as behavioral and cognitive therapies. Many of these preventive measures are derived from those used for migraine because the two conditions share significant overlap. These efforts aim to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration; improve responsiveness to treatment of acute attacks; ameliorate function; and decrease disability (Taylor 2016b).

The pharmacologic approach typically involves prescription of tricyclic antidepressants such as<a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+amitriptyline-drug-information?source=see_link">amitriptyline</a> (Semenov 2015). Other potential candidates for TTH prophylaxis include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as mirtazapine and <a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+venlafaxine-drug-information?source=see_link">venlafaxine</a>, and anticonvulsants such as <a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+gabapentin-drug-information?source=see_link">gabapentin</a> and <a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+topiramate-drug-information?source=see_link">topiramate</a> (Banzi et al. 2015). Practitioners should be cautious about prescribing these medications because current clinical data lacks sufficient evidence to support their efficacy.

Nonpharmocologic preventive treatments include biofeedback, relaxation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. They aim to identify and remove behavioral headache triggers, thereby preventing headaches. A combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmocologic approaches can be an effective treatment method. For example, combined tricyclic antidepressant and stress management therapy is recommended for patients with frequent episodic or chronic TTH. Those that prefer pharmacologic intervention over behavioral therapy should consider tricyclic therapy with <a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+amitriptyline-drug-information?source=see_link">amitriptyline</a>. In contrast, for patients who wish to avoid or cannot tolerate pharmacologic intervention, electromyography (EMG) biofeedback in conjunction with relaxation therapy is a viable treatment option.

<strong>Author's Note:</strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px">"This is my literature review for UWP 104F. I chose the topic of transgender medical treatment outcomes because of the recent increase in transgender inequity in the media. In the last 10 years, with the emergence of World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), there has been an increase in studies and resources available to clinicians. This emergence, while promising, is new and few clinicians feel comfortable treating these patients. This paper focuses on the outcomes of treatment on the wellbeing of patients struggling with gender dysphoria (GD). I originally chose this topic because of my connection with several transgender individuals. I was also curious as to what could be done to alleviate GD because I had heard about the prevalence of mental disorders and suicide rates among these patients. I do not focus on the treatments themselves in my literature review but on the wellbeing of the patient after receiving treatment. I thought that this was the important emphasis because the overall goal of these treatments is to improve the wellbeing of the patient."<!--more--></p>
<strong>Introduction</strong>

Individuals experiencing gender dysphoria (GD) have a marked incongruence between their assigned and experienced gender, resulting in great distress<sup>1</sup>. Issues, such as transgender bathroom policies, are exposing transgender rights to the mainstream media, highlighting this population’s lack of equity. Social marginalization can cause high rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide in this population<sup>2</sup>. In addition, barriers to health care leave these individuals at high risk for negative health outcomes<sup>2</sup>.

GD is accompanied by a desire to transition to an individual’s gender identity<sup>1</sup>. An increasing number of gender nonconforming youth are seeking medical intervention, yet in many cases few providers feel educated about and comfortable with treating these patients, making this population vulnerable<sup>2,4</sup>. There are guidelines for transitioning developed by respected organizations, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society<sup>4</sup>. These guidelines, which were developed after conducting clinical and academic research, are meant to guide clinicians to provide evidence-based medicine for their transgender patients, but it is important to note that there is not a universal consensus within the medical community<sup>4</sup> . There is disagreement among clinicians on whether the risks of transitioning or withholding treatment result in worse outcomes<sup>4</sup>. The purpose of this literature review is to analyze the benefits and risks of medical intervention to the wellbeing of patients experiencing GD in order to provide guidance to general practitioners. This literature review will first discuss the eligibility for beginning the transitioning process, followed by the outcome of  the medical stages of transitioning, and finally, the risks associated.

<strong>Eligibility</strong>

To be eligible for treatment in the following studies, patients must meet the standards established by WPATH<sup>5</sup>. These standards include a presence of GD that is intense and long lasting, an increase in GD when beginning puberty, an absence of any mental or physical problems that would affect treatment, and patient consent contingent on parental support<sup>5</sup>. Each guideline is essential to providing accurate care for these patients. For example, it is important to wait until GD increases during puberty because GD in prepubertal children often desists, while GD in adolescents during puberty have high rates of persistence<sup>5,9</sup>. Another WPATH standard for transitioning is parental support, which was shown in a study to be linked with buffering mental health illness in adolescents with GD<sup>6</sup>. These factors are all necessary to ensure a positive transitioning experience<sup>5,8</sup>.

<strong>Medical Interventions</strong>

<em>Puberty Suppression</em>

Puberty suppression can be used as both a diagnostic tool and a medically valuable treatment option for youth experiencing GD<sup>7,8,9</sup>. Puberty suppressors are drugs that prevent puberty from starting. Because puberty suppression tends to be fully reversible, it gives youth time to explore their gender identity while preventing their body from irreversibly changing during puberty<sup>7,8,9</sup>. It also makes surgery less redundant<sup>7</sup>. The following studies investigated the effects that puberty suppression had on psychological functioning and patient well-being after undergoing psychological support.

A study that tested puberty suppression and psychosocial functioning compared two groups of adolescents experiencing GD<sup>8</sup>. In this study, psychologists and psychiatrists conducted clinical interviews, psychological assessments, and questionnaires in order to evaluate the effects of psychological support on GD adolescents<sup>8</sup>. In the group with adolescents eligible for puberty suppression, six months of psychological support did not improve their psychosocial functioning <sup>8</sup>. In contrast, the adolescents’ psychosocial functioning significantly improved to levels equivalent to their  peers without GD after being on puberty suppressants for 12 months<sup>8</sup>. The second group of adolescents had their puberty suppression delayed due to not meeting the WPATH standards<sup>8</sup>. This group improved in psychosocial functioning with psychological therapy, but there was no further improvement after six months, and they scored lower in psychosocial functioning than their GD peers even after 18 months of therapy<sup>8</sup>. Although psychological support improved functioning, puberty suppression is associated with further overall improvement and is argued to be an effective treatment for youth experiencing GD<sup>8</sup>.

An additional study showed promising effects of puberty suppression by testing psychological functioning and well-being in 55 transitioning young adults<sup>9</sup>. Using questionnaires, participants were evaluated 3 times: before puberty suppression, at the introduction of cross-sex hormones (CSH), and at least 1 year after gender-reassignment surgery (GRS)<sup>9</sup>. Researchers in the study found that puberty suppression did not alleviate GD <sup>9</sup>. Puberty suppression does alleviate distress, but to fully remit GD, additional actions were required, such as CSH and GRS<sup>9</sup>.

<em>Cross-Sex Hormones and Gender-Reassignment Surgery</em>

Unlike puberty suppression, CSH and GRS are irreversible treatments<sup>10</sup>. CSH has a physical impact on both transmen and transwomen, eliciting changes that assist in presenting as their preferred gender<sup>10</sup>. GRS alters an individual’s sex to resemble their experienced gender. The following three studies focus on different aspects of patient’s well-being after CSH and GRS treatments.

A study that included 55 young transgender adults with similar representation of transmale and transfemale participants, observed that GD was alleviated after the start of CSH and GRS treatments<sup>9</sup>. In this group, the patients who  received treatment of CSH and GRS improved their body image satisfaction and psychological functioning to values similar to that of the general population<sup>9</sup>. These patients also showed particular improvement with anger, anxiety, and behavioral and emotional problems<sup>9</sup>. None of the participants regretted going through the transitioning process<sup>9</sup>. These results suggest that medical intervention may produce overall global functioning improvements for individuals experiencing GD.

A defining aspect of GD is distress. A study was conducted to test the stress level in transsexual individuals before and after starting CSH therapy<sup>11</sup>. At the beginning of the study, patients with GD who had not received hormone therapy had high levels of stress, insecurity, and anxiety<sup>11</sup>. Before they began treatment, participants had their level of cortisol measured<sup>11</sup>. Cortisol is a hormone released in response to stress, and can be used to measure perceived stress. Cortisol level was measured by taking a blood sample one hour after waking up for three days and perceived stress was determined using a self-reported evaluation<sup>11</sup>. It was found that all participants had higher levels of cortisol and perceived stress before CSH therapy, compared to levels found in the general population<sup>11</sup>. Patients treated with CSH therapy for one year reduced their cortisol levels equivalent to the general population<sup>11</sup>. It was also found that patterns of stress, such as insecurity and anxiety, were alleviated<sup>11</sup>. The data suggests that patients benefited from CSH therapy<sup>9,11</sup>.

In contrast to the studies previously mentioned that focused on short-term results, a long-term follow-up study assessed overall evaluation of participant’s transitions, <sup>15</sup>. 71 participants first underwent a clinical interview, and then were required to fill out a separate  follow-up questionnaire with periodic standardized questionnaires to keep a record of their changes over a long time frame<sup>15</sup>. The evaluations reported that using medical interventions reduced their GD<sup>15</sup>. Individuals reported high levels of well-being, with most employed, and sustaining satisfactory social lives<sup>15</sup>. The only common regret was wishing to have made the transition earlier in life<sup>7,9,15</sup>. It was found that most participants were in steady relationships and assessed their satisfaction with their relationships, on average 4.52 out of 5<sup>15</sup>. Similar results were found when evaluating friendships and relationships with their parents, which were 4.3 and 4.08 out of 5 respectively<sup>15</sup>.  There were three main themes that researchers found in participants: they felt positive about their decision to pursue treatment, none wished to reverse their decision, and they overall had a high level of life satisfaction<sup>15</sup>.  The long term effects of medial intervention seems promising for improving the wellbeing of individuals with GD <sup>4,15</sup>.

<em>Risk Assessment</em>

Due to the lack of abundant long-term studies on the risks of transitioning, there is some concern about long-term medical implications<sup>4,7</sup>. This section will review studies that investigated potential risks for individuals who pursue medical intervention.

In a case report, a 22-year follow-up was conducted with a patient, B, a transman who began puberty suppression at age 13, and later followed up with CSH and SR<sup>7</sup>. At age 35, he presented a healthy blood pressure, height, weight, bone mineral density above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile, normal serum values for lipids and showed no signs of diabetes<sup>7</sup>. In this case report, there was no observed negative risk<sup>7</sup>.

Additionally, since puberty suppression occurs during a time of major brain development, a study investigated the effects that puberty suppression has on executive functions to identify any risk associated<sup>12</sup>. They compared two groups of GD adolescents: one group treated with puberty suppression and the other group left untreated<sup>12</sup>. When data from the two groups were compared, the findings suggested that there is no difference in executive functioning of the patients<sup>12</sup>.

This next study focuses on the effects of CSH. It analyzed the physiological effects of 106 individuals with GD treated with CSH<sup>13</sup>. It found that 2% of the participants developed erythrocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. Transmen did see a large increase in acne and hair loss due to the increase in testosterone from their therapy<sup>13</sup>. Despite some negative outcomes, overall data showed that CSH was effective and carries a low risk  of side effects and severe negative outcomes<sup>13 </sup>. An additional report on CSH in transsexuals suggests that treatment is safe and there is low risk for osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer<sup>14</sup>. These findings predict that there is low short-term risk associated with transitioning, but clinical data for long-term risks is insufficient.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

With an increasing number of individuals presenting with GD, it is important to understand the outcomes of transitioning<sup>2,3</sup>. It appears that pubertal suppressants are a helpful aid for adolescents experiencing GD<sup>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15</sup>. Furthermore, CSH and GRS has been shown to alleviate GD<sup>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15</sup>. While these studies show promising results, there is little data available on the long-term risks of treatments. Despite this, immediate risks of delaying treatment include depression, self-harm, and suicidality<sup>2,3,5,6,7. </sup> While there may not be a consensus in the medical community, some professionals believe that withholding medical interventions for GD does more harm than good and can cause great distress and poor health outcomes<sup>4</sup>. As shown by the increase of transgender issues in the media, there is also little consensus by the public.

Another aspect of healthcare that can improve GD patients’ health outcomes is providing culturally competent care. Clinicians who care for these patients have a responsibility to provide medical care that is nonjudgmental and comprehensive. Being an ally is especially important for patients in this population, because they experience higher instances of health care inequity. The increase of the quality of life, coupled with the little known risk, suggests that medical intervention is a good option for patients with GD. To provide the best quality care, it is important that health care providers consult the Endocrine Society and WPATH guidelines when treating GD patients.

<strong>Author’s Note:</strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="font-weight:400">"I chose to write about this topic in an effort to gain a better understanding of Zika virus. While the topic is frequently in the news, the specifics of the virus are not always discussed in depth. As ongoing research is demonstrating the virus’ possible links to human health disorders, it is important for the general public to be informed about the facts of the virus, in an effort to minimize its spread."</span></p>
<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight:400">Recently in the U.S. and across the world, there has been growing concern regarding Zika virus, a pathogen primarily transmitted by the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Aedes </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">species of mosquito (CDC). Although infection with the Zika virus is generally only accompanied by mild symptoms, it has also been linked to microcephaly, a condition in which infants are born with abnormally small heads (Wilson, Schlagenhauf 1). As the number of people affected by Zika increases, further research is underway to look into Zika’s role in other neurological disorders in an effort to discover other effects and conditions the virus might be associated with. Recently, there has been scientific consensus that Zika can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that often begins with tingling and muscle weakness, and sometimes leads to paralysis (WHO). These new discoveries, in addition to the increased number of reported cases of the virus and new information regarding transmission, have led to greater worldwide interest in the virus. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in Uganda in the rhesus monkey, and has since been reported in many countries in Africa and Asia (Wilson, Schlagenhauf 1). More recently, it has been found in North, South, and Central America, in addition to many of the Pacific Islands (CDC). Within the past year, the virus received increased scrutiny, due to the discovery of its link to microcephaly. This responsibility for birth defects caused many people to regard the virus as being more severe than initially thought, as it can potentially lead to lifelong conditions for infants with mothers who are infected.  Additionally, the 2016 Olympic Games held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil further raised worldwide concern and greater recognition of the virus, as the virus has been reported in over 19 states in the country since its first local transmission in April of 2015 (Wilson, Schlagenhauf 1-2). Together, both the link to microcephaly and increased number of places reporting local Zika transmission led to increased media coverage of Zika, sounding an alert and encouraging prevention to people planning to travel to countries experiencing outbreaks. It appears that in the case of the Olympics, these attempts of prevention were successful, as the World Health Organization reports that there were no cases of Zika infections resulting from the Olympics (Tavernise). More recently, the U.S. also has experienced a Zika outbreak, with 43 locally acquired cases of the virus, all in Florida, and 3,314 travel-associated cases; and these numbers are rapidly growing (CDC). Zika has been declared a “global public health emergency” by the World Health Organization (BBC).</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Symptoms associated with the virus are generally mild and often not detectable. Common symptoms include fever, rash, aches, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (an infection of the eye), and generally go away within a week (CDC). Less commonly, an infected individual may experience muscle pain and headaches (CDC). Due to the lack of severity of these symptoms, people may become infected and not realize it. While the symptoms are generally mild, it is still important for individuals to get tested for Zika, as more serious and lasting effects are possible. Its link to microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome are of particular importance, and there is currently further research being conducted to explore possible links to other neurological disorders (WHO).  This is especially pertinent to pregnant women, or women planning on getting pregnant, as many cases of microcephaly in infants born to women affected with Zika virus have been documented (CDC). Microcephaly results in a smaller head and brain size and can lead to infants having a variety of other medical problems, such as dwarfism, seizures, and facial and joint deformities (Wilson, Schlagenhauf 2). Additionally, several children also experienced learning disabilities, impaired motor function, struggles with balance and movement, and delays in speech (Boston Children’s Hospital).</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">In addition to the increased number in identified viral infections and the virus’ potential to cause birth defects, recent discoveries in its modes of transmission are also demonstrating the greater threat the virus may pose. While it was initially thought that this virus was only transmitted to humans from mosquitoes, new evidence suggests that human to human transmission can also occur. The ability of Zika to be transmitted through sexual intercourse increases public concern about the virus due to the effects that the virus can have on fetuses, and also because of the realization that people can contract the virus without ever coming into contact with a mosquito carrying the virus (WHO). </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment available for Zika virus infection. Thus, it is very important for people, especially pregnant women, to take preventative measures against becoming infected. The use of insect repellants and clothing that limits exposure of body parts can be helpful in preventing mosquito bites. Additionally, it is very important for people to be aware of the areas that this virus is endemic and to either limit traveling to or take additional precautions when going to these areas. Finally, it is also imperative for people to take precautions regarding the sexual transmission of the disease, either by using condoms or by practicing abstinence.  </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Overall, it is very important for the general public to have full knowledge and awareness about this virus, in order to minimize its spread.  While the extent of the dangers attributable to this virus may not yet be fully understood, any instance of an emerging pathogen that threatens human health requires ongoing scrutiny. </span>

<strong>Author’s Note:</strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="font-weight:400">"I chose to write about Tourette Syndrome because someone who is dear to me was diagnosed with it. Watching him struggle at a young age, I could only imagine how difficult it must have been dealing with strange and disapproving looks from peers and teachers. Through the gradual decline of symptoms over the years, he learned to cope with his tics and sought to educate others about the syndrome. Inspired by his story, I wrote this case report in hopes of share his journey with others."</span>
<!--more--></p>
<span style="font-weight:400">Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by tics, which are involuntary, nonrhythmic, repetitive movements and vocalizations. In about half of the patients with Tourette syndrome, tic symptoms decline during adolescence and disappear by age 18. While it is possible for tics to persist into adulthood, in 40 to 45 percent of the cases tics’ severity gradually declines. In this case report, the patient was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome at the age of eight and continues to display tics at the present age of 18.</span>

<b>Case Report</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">The patient is an eighteen-year-old Asian male residing in suburban California. At age eight, he presented to a psychiatric outpatient department with a 2-month history of repetitive involuntary eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and throat clearing. The intensity and duration of these motor and vocal tics varied, with no single episode lasting more than a few seconds, but he was never completely symptom-free. The frequency of his tics ranged from many times a day to once every few days. These tics were more severe when the patient was fatigued or stressed and less severe when the patient was mentally focused. The patient could voluntarily suppress the tics for a few minutes at a time, but such effort induced great stress and restlessness. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Prior to displaying symptoms of Tourette syndrome, the patient was reported by his family to possess a sunny disposition. He excelled in his academic endeavors and maintained friendly relationships with his peers. With the emergence of tics, the patient began to feel embarrassed at school as his symptoms drew the attention of his teachers and fellow students. His teachers attributed the symptoms to typical disruptive classroom behavior and relayed their observations to the patient’s family. When the behavior persisted for more than a month, the teachers recommended the parents to seek professional assistance. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">The patient’s family sought medical expertise two months after the onset of symptoms when the patient was eight. The patient </span><span style="font-weight:400">had a normal delivery with no antenatal or postnatal complications and experienced no developmental problems. </span><span style="font-weight:400">He has no history of psychotic symptoms, hyperactivity, obsessiveness, compulsiveness, or substance abuse. There is no family history of mental disorders. The psychiatrist performed a continuous performance test (CPT) of attention, revealing borderline severity of Tourette syndrome. No triggering factors could be identified. Observed symptoms included excessive eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and throat clearing. A physical examination showed no other abnormalities. The neuropsychological examination revealed that the patient had intact thought processes and higher mental functioning. Comorbidities of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were excluded by clinical interview. Lead poisoning was eliminated as a potential cause of the observed symptoms through a laboratory blood test.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">The psychiatrist educated the patient and his family about Tourette syndrome and recommended that they speak with the patient’s teachers about his condition so that individualized support and supervision could be provided. Since the patient’s symptoms did not interfere significantly with his social and academic performance, the psychiatrist eliminated medication as a treatment option. With a newfound understanding of Tourette syndrome, the patient was able to better cope with his symptoms and his negative emotional responses to the disorder declined. His confidence was gradually restored with the support of his family, friends, and teachers. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">The patient’s eye blinking persisted for two years but decreased in intensity and frequency until it completely disappeared at the age of ten. However, he continues to display shoulder shrugging and throat clearing at the current age of 18, though their severity has been steadily decreasing. Presently, the patient exhibits these symptoms at a frequency of a few tic episodes per month, each lasting one to three seconds.</span>

<b>Discussion</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Tourette syndrome is one of the three tic disorders recognized by the </span><span style="font-weight:400">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span><span style="font-weight:400"> under neurodevelopmental disorders (APA 2013). The exact cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown, though studies suggest that it involves complex interactions among social, environmental, and genetic factors. One hypothesis is that defect in the striatal-thalamic-cortical spinal system causes disinhibition of the motor and limbic system, leading to Tourette syndrome. The disorder is often transmitted bilineally, but scientists haven’t been able to identify specific genes responsible for producing the symptoms. The offspring of parents with Tourette syndrome faces a 22 percent risk in developing the disorder, while siblings of Tourette patients have a risk of around 8 percent.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">The diagnosis of Tourette syndrome does not involve any laboratory tests. Instead, a clinical evaluation is performed following the DSM guidelines. To avoid misdiagnosis, Tourette syndrome is characterized by three critical components. First is the presence of both motor and vocal tics for more than a year, though they do not need to occur simultaneously. Second, the tic onset must be before age 18 years. Third, tics must not be caused by substance intake or another medical condition. A family history of similar neurological symptoms supports the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. The diagnosis of Tourette syndrome can also be buttressed by the presence of comorbidities including ADHD and OCD. Tourette syndrome can be isolated from other hyperkinetic movement disorders such as chorea, dystonia, athetosis, myoclonus, and paroxysmal dyskinesia by its two unique qualities: the ability to suppress tics and the premonitory sensations that often precede tics.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Education about Tourette syndrome to people who interact with the patient is key to managing the disorder. Only when symptoms of Tourette syndrome interfere with social, academic, or occupational performance is intervention warranted. Treatment methods are directed to eliminate the most serious symptoms, including those of comorbidities such as ADHD, OCD, and mood disorders. When tics are mild and nondisabling, education and counseling present an effective plan to treat Tourette syndrome. But when tics become troublesome, medications such as </span><a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+tetrabenazine-drug-information?source=see_link"><span style="font-weight:400">tetrabenazine</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">, </span><a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+fluphenazine-drug-information?source=see_link"><span style="font-weight:400">fluphenazine</span></a><span style="font-weight:400">, and or</span><a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+risperidone-pediatric-drug-information?source=see_link"><span style="font-weight:400">risperidone</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> are prescribed to alleviate the symptoms. Fluphenazine is a dopamine receptor blocker whereas tetrabenazine is a </span><span style="font-weight:400">dopamine depleter that inhibits vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2). Both drugs work to reduce tics’ frequency and intensity by approximately 60 to 80 percent (Jankovic 2015). It is advantageous to use the latter antidopaminergic drug because it provides the same benefits </span><span style="font-weight:400">without the harmful side effect of </span><span style="font-weight:400">tardive dyskinesias, a disorder leading to involuntary, repetitive body movements.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">For patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to the pharmacologic approach, behavioral therapy is recommended as an alternative intervention strategy. More specifically, habit reversal training (HRT) is implemented to control tics. There are two components of HRT: tic-awareness training, which focuses on recognizing early signs of tic onset, and competing-response training, which develops a voluntary movement that opposes the tic. </span><span style="font-weight:400">There are several limitations that apply to this treatment method. First, in order for this behavioral management to be successful, the parents and the therapist must be well versed in the HRT techniques so they can be actively involved in the training process. Such endeavor requires a substantial commitment of time and effort on the part of the patient, the therapist, and the parents. Due to these rigorous demands, it is unlikely that all parties will be able to maintain the necessary compliance with the treatment plan for sustained benefit to be observed. Another concern addresses the possibility that the patient's attention and learning may be negatively impacted by the mental effort required to fully comply with HRT.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">If tics are concentrated in specific muscles in the body, botulinum toxin injections into the affected regions offer a viable treatment option. To treat the comorbid condition of ADHD, alpha adrenergic agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine are used to suppress related behavioral symptoms, especially those associated with impulse control and rage attacks. Guanfacine is preferred over clonidine because it requires fewer daily doses and is less sedating. To treat symptoms of OCD, psychiatrists often prescribe </span><span style="font-weight:400">a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as </span><a href="https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information?source=see_link"><span style="font-weight:400">fluoxetine</span></a><span style="font-weight:400"> starting at 20 mg daily (Jankovic 2015).</span>

<strong>Author's Note:</strong>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="font-weight:400">"I wrote this piece for my UWP 104F: 'Writing in the Health Professions' class with Professor Walsh in Winter 2016. Our assignment was to examine a health related research question and explore the subject in a quarter-long research and synthesis process. I decided to write about Schizophrenia because I realized that I knew close to nothing accurate about people with mental health illnesses. Lack of understanding of the disease can contribute to stigmatization of these patients and cause further psychological harm. On my way to demystifying Schizophrenia, one of the most researched relationship I found was that of Marijuana and Schizophrenia. Throughout this process, I not only gained valuable knowledge on this topic, but I also learned to appreciate the various methods scientists developed to study the mechanism of this multi-layered and abstract disease."</span></p>

<strong>Abstract</strong>

<span style="font-weight:400">The high prevalence of Schizophrenic patients with the comorbidity of cannabis-dependency disorder prompted researchers to investigate the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia. The purpose of this literature review is to examine the current research on various factors that are significant in this association. The paper will look into retrospective studies that compare and contrast the two groups: schizophrenic patients with cannabis-dependency disorder and schizophrenic patients without cannabis-dependency disorder. Furthermore, I will examine studies that analyze the effects of cannabis on the cognition of adults with schizophrenia and cannabis-dependency disorder, as well as studies that explore the effects of cannabis on adolescents and its relation to schizophrenia. Significant factors found to be involved in this relationship are age, gender, genetic predisposition, and cannabis consumption behaviors.</span>

<b>Introduction </b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Schizophrenia spectrum disorder is a debilitating chronic mental illness that alters one’s emotional, psychological, and cognitive foundations. It gives rise to hallucinations, delusions, mania, reduced expression of feelings and pleasure, poor decision making skills, impaired working memory, and unusual thought content. Often times, schizophrenic patients acquire other illnesses, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression, bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, and drug addiction- the reason for which is another large topic of research. The cause of Schizophrenia is unknown and, as is the case for many mental illnesses, diagnosis relies on the appearance of particular symptoms. This questions the accuracy of the diagnostic criteria and demonstrates the lack of knowledge the medical community retains on this disease. Interestingly, schizophrenic patients present a median lifetime cannabis use disorder rate of 27.1%, as compared to the general population lifetime cannabis disorder rate of 10%. Cannabis-use disorder or cannabis-dependency disorder is characterized by an unhealthy pattern of usage of cannabis despite the harmful disturbances on daily activities and the consequences of physical and mental distress. This high correlation between cannabis and schizophrenia captures the attention of many researchers. In current literature, studies are conducted to answer three questions: (1) Does cannabis usage induce schizophrenia? (2) If so, is cannabis-induced schizophrenia a distinct disorder of its own? (3) Does the onset of schizophrenia draw patients to consume cannabis? My literature review will attempt to analyze in depth the most important factors involved in the relationship between schizophrenia and cannabis, as well as attempt to answer the three big questions in schizophrenia research today. </span>

<b>Retrospective Studies of Schizophrenic Patients with Cannabis-dependence disorder and Schizophrenic Patients without Cannabis-dependence disorder</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Comparing and contrasting the variables associated with the schizophrenic patients who are lifetime cannabis users and those who are not is a logical starting point to begin analysis of the role cannabis plays in schizophrenia. Helle et. al. (2016) considered the factors: family history of psychosis, gender, age of onset of Schizophrenia, and type of substance consumed. A large heterogeneous sample of 1,119 patients in the age range of 18-65 were drawn from three clinical sites in Norway. They were clinically diagnosed with Schizophrenia using the diagnostic test DSM-IV. This manual allows health professionals to take into consideration multiple factors and severity of the factors to diagnose patients effectively. Family history of psychosis, lifetime substance use, and age of onset of schizophrenia information were obtained through patient interviews. Age of onset of schizophrenia is determined by first psychotic episode, either reported by patients or determined by the patient’s first visit to a clinical psychiatrist. Using information from interviews and urine samples, the participants were diagnosed with substance use disorders. The substance-use group included participants who abused, were dependent on, had lifetime registration of, or had positive results on urine tests for one of the following substances: cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, and opiates. The abstinent group never used any of these substances. A thorough comparison of the two groups revealed that there were more males in the substance group, 67.8%, as compared to the abstinent group of 53.5%. The substance group was comprised of younger participants with lower average years of education, and a shorter mean duration of illness. Cannabis is the only substance found to be significantly associated with the age of onset of Schizophrenia; approximately a three years earlier age of onset of psychotic symptoms is seen in schizophrenic patients who are cannabis-dependent. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Sarzzazin et. al. (2015) conducted a similar study with more specific groups but fewer participants. The participants consisted of 171 schizophrenic patients from a hospital in France; they were grouped into “Pre-onset Cannabis-use disorder” group (Pre-onset CUD) or “No pre-onset group” (No Pre-onset CUD). Patients who stated that their usage of cannabis started at or before the onset of schizophrenia are in the pre-onset group and all other schizophrenic patients with co-morbidity of CUD were classified in the No Pre-onset CUD group. Through comparisons, it was found that the Pre-onset CUD group was predominately male (67.1%), however, there was no difference in the mean age of onset of schizophrenia (both 23.7 years of age) or difference in types and magnitude of symptoms or magnitude of symptoms.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Mane et. al. (2015) compared and contrasted demographic, family history, symptoms, and gender in 119 first psychotic episode schizophrenic patients from ages 18-35 who were cannabis users and those who were not. First psychotic episode schizophrenic patients refer to those that have only experienced psychotic symptoms once. The patients in the cannabis-users group used cannabis at least weekly in the previous six months. Additionally, the participants filled out questionnaires specifying their reasons for cannabis use. There was no difference in symptoms found between cannabis users and non-cannabis users. However, cannabis users had an earlier onset of psychosis and were predominately male. The reasons for cannabis use in schizophrenic patients are largely to deal with hallucinations, suspiciousness, boredom, depression, or to alleviate medication side effects. This study supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia induces patients to seek cannabis usage. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Helle et. al. and Sarzzazin et. al, examined factors that are difficult to determine correctly. The methods used to determine age of onset of schizophrenia and history of psychosis were based on patients’ memory quality or on access to medical notes and interviews. However, asking patients to recollect information from memory is not very accurate. Inaccuracy  in methods may contribute to the discrepancy between Helle et. al. finding that cannabis increases onset of schizophrenia by three years and Sarzzazin finding no correlation between cannabis and age of onset of schizophrenia. Furthermore, there may be information about family history that researchers do not have records of. With these limitations in mind, all three studies found no difference in family history of psychosis between the two groups, suggesting that genetics do not play a role in the onset of schizophrenia. Additionally, there were no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics. This does not support the hypothesis that cannabis-induced schizophrenia is its own clinical entity. Helle et. al, Sarzzazin et. al, and Mane et. al. found that cannabis-using groups are most likely to be male and younger than the non-cannabis users. Relationships found in these studies could be identified as correlation and not causation because there is no clear cause-effect relationship examined.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">While the previous studies mentioned in this literature review determined possible correlations between cannabis usage and schizophrenia, Kelley et. al. (2016) determined a causation relationship; in this retrospective study, marijuana use in the premorbid period was examined. A total of 247 English-speaking participants between ages 18 and 40 were used in this study. Marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco use were recorded based on how many joints, drinks, and cigarettes were used per month. Interviews were conducted with each patient and two other family members to determine the month of onset of psychotic symptoms. Subsequently, a precise number of the three substance used were determined in the period before psychotic symptoms began, the premorbid period, for each participant. The study found that certain behaviors during the premorbid period correlated with an increase in psychosis. Males, again, were found to be more prevalent in all substance groups. An increase in use of marijuana was associated with an increase in rate of psychosis. Daily use during pre-prodromal period approximately doubles the rate of progression to schizophrenia. Any increase in use during the premorbid period increases the rate of onset of schizophrenia. Specifically, escalation of marijuana usage in the five years premorbid period causes an earlier onset of schizophrenia. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">The temporal link found between usage of marijuana and onset of schizophrenia shows that the usage of marijuana during the premorbid period is not the most important. Rather, the increase of dosage during that period is the most predictive of an earlier onset of schizophrenia. However, it is important to note that in this study, cannabis was found to increase the rate of onset of schizophrenia, not induce the onset of the disorder itself. This discovery explains the lack of difference found in age of onset of schizophrenia between pre-onset CUD group and no pre-onset CUD group in Sarzzazin et. al. Because the study did not take into account the amount of cannabis usage during the time before the onset of schizophrenia, no differences in the groups’ age of onset were seen.</span>

<b>Effects of cannabis on Cognition of Adults with Schizophrenia</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">The study conducted in Power et. al. (2015) classified schizophrenic patients into three groups: cannabis non-users (CN), cannabis- users (CU), and cannabis dependency (CD) and administered two cognitive assessment tests. The National Adult Reading Test Revised was used to assess the cognitive ability prior to illness onset and the Digit Symbol Coding Test assessed the patients’ current cognitive abilities. Demographic and clinical differences between the groups were examined after accounting for confounding variables. No difference in the results of the tests was found between the groups, revealing that cannabis has no effect on the Intelligent Quotients of the schizophrenic patients.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Risk-taking is an important function in executive cognitive abilities and correlates with one’s ability to make decisions. People with schizophrenia and comorbid of cannabis dependence have been observed to possess altered risk-taking abilities. This study analyzes participants’ risk taking abilities with a virtual lab experiment and two questionnaires. The Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) is a simulation where participants are to assess when to pump a virtual balloon, given caution to not pop the balloon. Money was given to the participants for each pump, but once the balloon pops, the money accumulated diminishes as well. The Risk Perception Questionnaire and the Self Mastery Scale allow the participants to analyze their own locus of control. Schizophrenic patients without cannabis-dependent disorder displayed the least amount of risk taking among the three groups. Patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis dependence have a unique pattern of risk taking that is intermediate between people with schizophrenia and people who are cannabis dependent. (Fischer, 2015)</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">While Power et. al found that the intelligent quotient in adults are not affected by cannabis usage, the study in Fischer et. al. shows that there are cognitive differences between schizophrenic patients and schizophrenic patients with cannabis dependence disorder. The difference in cognitive results seen in the two studies might be because cannabis induces an effect on different cognitive domains of the brain, which are differentiated by the tests determining participants’ intelligence quotient and the tests assessing participants’ risk-taking abilities. The results from the two studies indicate a possible weak correlation between cannabis and cognition in schizophrenic patients. </span>

<b>Early Cannabis use Impact on Adolescent Brain</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Perhaps the most direct way to analyze cannabis’ effects on people is a direct injection of cannabis into rats and then note the immediate results. In this experiment, Renard and her research team injected adult and adolescent rats with the psychoactive component in marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol (THC). They observed whether the injection increased schizophrenic symptoms, as compared to control adult and adolescent rats with no injections. Willingness of the rats to interact with others determined the variable for social motivation and social cognition. Furthermore, anxiety behaviors were observed by examining rats’ startle reflex to white noise and by placing rats in a box filled with light and observing the time it takes for the rats to leave the dark box and enter the light box because rats are naturally display adverse behaviors towards light. Neural recordings placements were also done to examine the frequency of neuronal firing in the brain. Lastly, the protein extraction was conducted. THC injected adolescent rats spent less time with stranger rats, traveled shorter distances, and made fewer transitions from dark to light boxes, as well as spent more time doing so. An increase in frequency of neuronal firing in adolescent rat and a hyperactive dopamine pathway were found. In adolescent rats, there was a significant decrease in phosphorylated proteins, while a significant increase in phosphorylated proteins was observed in adult rats. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Similarly, many studies have found cannabis to have an effect on neurological development of adolescents, especially during the spike of testosterone in adolescent boys during puberty. In French et. al, (2015), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to observe the effects of cannabis on adolescent brains during age 14 and 18. They observed the cortical thickness of the brain and the amount of gray matter present. Participants were separated into 2 groups based on a self-report questionnaire about whether or not participants have consumed cannabis in their life. Lower cortical thickness and lower amounts of gray matter were seen in males with higher polygenic risk score who consumes cannabis regularly, beginning at an age as early as 16. This correlation was not seen in females with high-risk scores or males with low risk scores.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">We can confidently conclude that adolescents are more sensitive to the effects of cannabis than adults. Not only do the behavioral changes seen in adolescent rats support the hypothesis of the significant effect cannabis has on the subjects, but the discovery of physically altered proteins through phosphorylation in the dopamine pathway further confirms this conclusion.Specifically, in human male adolescents who are genetically predisposed to schizophrenia and began usage of cannabis early in their lifetime, lower cortical thickness and a decrease in the amount of gray matter in the brain was observed. Both cortical thickness and gray matter are indicative of the cognitive functions of the participants. These studies provide solid evidence in support of the hypothesis that long-term exposure of marijuana in male adolescents may lead to neuropsychiatric-like symptoms such as anxiety, decreased social motivation and cognition, working memory dysfunction, and altered signaling pathways in the brain. </span>

<b>Conclusion </b>

<span style="font-weight:400">The relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia still remains controversial. Understanding mental illnesses such as schizophrenia poses a challenge to health professionals because the symptoms cannot be easily measured and examined without relying on subjective accounts from patients. Despite lack of objective tools to examine factors involved in the association between cannabis and schizophrenia, researchers manage to conduct sound experiments, although each carry its own limitations. Retrospective analysis provided incongruous evidences of earlier onset of schizophrenia with cannabis-dependence disorder. However, when taking into account the specific amount of cannabis consumed in the prodromal period, it solidified a strong association between time of consumption and behavior of consumption to earlier onset of psychotic symptoms. While no difference in clinical symptoms were found between cannabis-dependence schizophrenic patients and schizophrenic users that were non-cannabis users, the larger amount of psychotic symptoms found in adolescent rats in comparison to adult rats provided a clue that age is an important factor to consider. More research on cannabis’ effects on adolescent brains revealed that genetically predisposed adolescent males who consumed cannabis regularly had a higher likelihood of jumpstarting the onset of the illness. Current literature does not support cannabis-induced schizophrenia as a separate entity, but the hypothesis of using cannabis as self-medication was supported several times. From the evidence proposed, cannabis consumption does not directly cause the onset of schizophrenia, but well-conducted studies do suggest cumulative cannabis consumption in the premorbid period does induce an earlier onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in genetically predisposed male adolescents. Specific effects of cannabis on human adolescents reinforce this association. More studies will need to be conducted to further explore if the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia is actually a causation relationship and to provide insight for possible treatments and cures for Schizophrenia.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Independent Project Findings

By Harsh Sharma,  Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior, '13

Author's Note:
<p style="padding-left:30px">"I wrote this paper to share my independent project takeaways with everyone who is interested in, or a part of, the healthcare field. This project taught me a lot about what we can do to help our patients get the most out of the clinic they go to. As you gain experiences in the medical field, think about the services your organization offers and how you can use your skills to enhance those services to the next level!"</p>

<b>Background</b>

My Community HealthCorps experience at LifeLong East Oakland, a federally qualified community health center, can be described as a tale of two halves. During the first half, I accompanied Brigitte Peltekof, LifeLong’s social worker, on home visits in the East Bay Area.

I slowly learned to conduct an entire home visit by observing Brigitte. This entailed asking patients about the different social determinants of health– housing, income, transportation, caregiver support, and psychosocial history, to name a few. We then used this information to help patients access the health and social services they needed.

Amassing patient interactions over 5 months gave me the confidence to pursue an independent project centered around home visits during the second half of my term. Without having worked out the details, I chose to make high blood pressure, or hypertension, the main focus of my project for several reasons. I primarily recognized its many eventual consequences, including damage to the arteries, brain aneurysm, and kidney failure. I hoped to raise awareness of high blood pressure’s life-threatening effects to our hypertensive patients.

My time at LifeLong leading up to the project also made me aware of the barriers patients face in coming to the clinic. By meeting patients where they live, my hope for this project was to make healthcare as accessible as possible for the patients involved.

<b>Project Vision</b>

I had three goals in mind when proposing this project. They are as follows:
<ol>
 	<li>To provide the panel of patients with blood pressure cuffs and encourage a greater level of engagement in their well-being by monitoring their blood pressure and exercising daily.</li>
 	<li>To instruct patients about no-cost, easy-to-perform breathing and energy exercises intended to elicit the relaxation response via regularly scheduled home and clinic visits.</li>
</ol>
Evidence by Stahl et al. 2015 (in “Relaxation Response and Resiliency Training and Its Effect on Healthcare Resource Utilization”) states that “mind body interventions can reduce individual disease burden as well as the utilization of healthcare resources and are well suited to the changing healthcare environment.”
<ol start="3">
 	<li>To reduce patient's’ blood pressure readings by encouraging the integration of</li>
</ol>
breathing and energy exercises into their daily lives.

<b>Home Visits</b>

I began visiting patients at the end of January once I received the shipment of blood pressure monitors and finalized an initial panel of patients. During our first visit, patients signed a consent form, were educated about the consequences of hypertension and guidelines for blood pressure numbers, and agreed to a list of responsibilities as part of their participation in this panel.

Patients were provided with a blood pressure log at the beginning of each subsequent home visit to enter the date, time, and blood pressure recording, along with comments about how they felt and if they had taken their medication that day. The previous blood pressure log was collected and uploaded into the patient’s medical record. I measured the patient’s blood pressure during the visit and recorded it in the log.

Home visits also entailed asking how the patient was doing. This led to conversations about the patient’s family, home environment, level of physical activity, concerns about a medication’s side effects, and more. Before leaving, I scheduled my next visit with the patients to increase the likelihood of maintaining regular visits.

This project’s initial focus was to parse out three breathing exercises during each home visit, so as to not frontload the patients with too much information at once. The breathing exercises are often utilized in yoga (including chair yoga), energy medicine, and meditation. Most patients discovered their blood pressure to be significantly lower after engaging in breathing exercises for 5 minutes. While some patients looked forward to learning a new set of breathing exercises during each home visit, some wished to focus their efforts on a select few.

Patients who, at first, had only been interested in learning additional breathing exercises also started to utilize me as a health coach. They wanted to know when their next doctor’s appointment was, how they could switch providers, whether they were taking their medication correctly, etc. They recognized the value of having someone from the clinic come to their home and took full advantage of my service. Some patients asked me to prepare a handout about diabetic neuropathy, come up with a week-long menu of health meals, help schedule a dentist appointment, and so on. Electronic versions of all handouts can be found at: http://tinyurl.com/HTNproject

As a result, these home visits took an unexpected but welcoming change. I was now indirectly addressing hypertension by helping patients with their other chronic conditions and overall well-being. Considering that most patients on the panel, and the community in general, are alone during the day time, having someone to talk to and listen to them became refreshingly therapeutic.

<b>Patient Q &amp; A’s</b>

During my penultimate home visit, I asked each patient twelve questions about this project. Patient interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Below is a paraphrased summary of the Q &amp;A. You will find the questions and assortment of answers provided by the patients at the end of this paper.

Patient takeaways from this project included awareness about the importance of getting in a relaxed state of mind while taking their blood pressure. Deborah S. spoke of the stark difference between taking her blood pressure with the TV on and off. The latter allowed her to reach a more calm state, which resulted in a lower blood pressure reading. Jarvis J. reflected on the project as a life-changing experience that improved his other health conditions and uplifted his overall sense of well-being.

Patients provided insightful suggestions on how this project could be improved. One suggestion was to go on a walk instead of having home visits, so as to provide patients with a change of environment. Linda S. suggested holding a monthly group meeting at the clinic so panelists could engage with one another and exchange successes and challenges.

When asked about what advice she would give about blood pressure, Willie B. offered that blood pressure plays a significant role in affecting quality of life as one ages. Kris D. advised individuals to focus on taking care of themselves and keeping stress to a minimum. She admitted that making time for herself is something she needs to work on, but she recognizes how important it is in maintaining a healthy blood pressure.

Most patients resoundingly wished their healthcare provider to know that this program should continue. I worked with patients who predominantly spend their time at home, alone. Home visits gave them an opportunity to socialize and talk to someone, which is powerfully therapeutic in itself.

<b>Reflections</b>

I have been deeply humbled by the patients I have had the honor of serving. I admire my patients’ courage to own up to their health conditions and their willpower to commit to improving their health. I am moved by their openness to invite a stranger into their home again and again. Their vulnerability in sharing their fears, hopes, strengths, and successes inspires me. I have seen them grow into individuals who are more invested in taking care of their health and more knowledgeable about how to do so. By spending countless hours with them, I have become a better listener and patient advocate. I have experienced tremendous personal growth from hearing their incredible stories and helping them navigate through our healthcare system. I will carry the lessons I have learned from them throughout my medical career and beyond. I want to thank them for their hospitality, their time, and their willingness to change.

By experiencing patients’ inquisitive nature toward health-related topics and their need for assistance with navigating our healthcare system (making appointments, asking about referrals, etc.), I am convinced that this project should continue to exist.

Patients who have someone that they can spend their time with in the community, without any significant time restrictions, receive a rich layer of individualized patient care and experience greater patient satisfaction. They are also more likely to utilize their clinic’s services and be intrinsically motivated to pursue a better state of health.

<b>Moving Forward</b>

Based on the feedback from patients and agreement from LifeLong staff, I firmly recommend that a project like this become a commonplace feature of our clinics. Having Health Coach Volunteers would allow clinics to do just that. Better yet, all parties involved would benefit from such a program.

Volunteers, who would mostly be future or concurrent applicants to medical and other health professional schools, would stand to gain an unparalleled experience working with the underserved on a 1-on-1 basis. They would have the opportunity to identify a patient panel and follow it over several months. Health coach volunteers would create patient education materials, shadow social workers and providers, and gain a strong letter of recommendation. Not only will their experience give them an edge in their applications to professional or graduate schools, but it also will deepen their understanding of how healthcare works and increase their maturity as they continue on their path to becoming future healthcare professionals.

If you would like to implement a similar program at your clinic, do not hesitate to contact me at sharmaharsh91@gmail.com. I will be happy to provide you with the appropriate resources.

<b>Extended Patient Q &amp; A's
</b>
<ol>
 	<li>What has motivated you to be a part of this project?</li>
</ol>
<i>“Blood pressure issues. Newly discovered BP [blood pressure] issues.” –Susan B.</i>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Before I started doing home/clinic visits, what did you think this project would be like?</li>
</ol>
<i>“I didn’t really know. I just, um, was like ‘hey, [they’re] just trying to see...’ I was really wanting to learn things to help me de-stress my body and that was my main concern of how to get this blood pressure down. Because even though I went through a process of losing weight before, I still had high blood pressure. So, it wasn’t just my weight, it was also the stress levels that I carry in my body.” -Kris D.</i>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>When I started doing home/clinic visits, how did these expectations change? Was it for the better or worse?</li>
</ol>
<i>“It was for the better. I’ve noticed that my BP has gone down. Like, the last time I checked it was like 121/79, which was never, ever the case. And I think that has to do with the fact that I started eating more vegetables, and taking time to jot down my BP, be more careful in doing the breathing techniques as well...and turning off the TV while taking my BP. I think that’s #1. Because before I would do it with the TV on and be more in tune with that and I think because I take time to just relax, breathe, and not have anything interfere helped.” -Deborah S.</i>
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Now that the project is coming to a close, how would you reflect on it?</li>
</ol>
<i>“A life-changing experience. With the way my BP was, it was just a matter of time before I had a stroke or...or something else could occur from it, but since I been in the program, all the testing that I’ve been doing for other things that I’ve been coming to the doctor for has just been beautiful. You know, I think my BP being kept at where it’s supposed to be kept at makes the other things work even properly without even me knowing it, since I’m not a doctor. But I can just feel the difference. You know, I’m not walking around with my head just feeling heavy. Like if you touch it, your head’s about ready to explode. You know, I was walking around like that for quite some time. And it was time for me to wake up and you guys woke me up to see that my life mattered.” -Jarvis J.</i>
<ol start="5">
 	<li>How could this project have been better?</li>
</ol>
<i>“Well, we could’ve started the walking earlier. You know, going for a walk when I visit, we could’ve started that earlier. But other than that, it’s...it’s great. But I think I like the out visit more than I do the in-home like, you know going out walking with you and then going over the things...because it’s just, I don’t know, you take it in better I think. Because when you’re in home, you’re just...it’s like okay, hurry up and finish. But walking the lake [Merritt] made it like, okay, you know, we gotta walk anyway, so why not talk and do, yeah.” -Deborah S.</i>

<i>“If we had did it in a...I don’t know...group would be all right to see what other people is do- ing. Sitting around, talking about what can be done better. I’d like to know if other people were benefiting, besides me with the program. If we got in a group, we could talk about it, and see what we could do better.” -Linda H.</i>
<ol start="6">
 	<li>What would make it easier for you or other patients to be compliant?</li>
</ol>
<i>“Be serious about it. Everything that I’ve done at the clinic, I’ve taken as seriously. And I realize that everything that happens there, which has been, you know... given to me, has been a help.” -Gloria R.</i>
<ol start="7">
 	<li>If you had to give patients who are in your shoes advice about BP, what would you tell them?</li>
</ol>
<i>“That eating actually is really...you know, eating the right stuff, eating vegetables and exercising has a lot to do with your BP, too. So taking time out to do that. And, just make sure you eat right, exercise, and do breathing techniques. I didn’t think the breathing techniques would work, but they do. They really put your mind at ease.” -Deborah S.</i>

<i>“I’d tell em it was very important for them to know what their BP is because that’s kind of determining what their quality of life is gonna be in the future.” -Willie ‘Delphine’ B.</i>

<i>“Pay attention. Pay very close attention because it’s something that can change, you know, without you being aware of it. That’s why they call BP the silent killer.” -Susan B.</i>

<i>“Don’t stress...don’t stress. Stress is a silent killer and I’ve been told that by a physician at LifeLong. Even though I’ve been told that and I try not to stress...I think once I get through my challenges of school and other things, I’m gonna really work harder on taking care of me. And I told that to my daughter and a friend that I wanted to take more time, um, taking care of me now. Because I’ve given my all to other things except for me, and I wanna make me feel better in the long run. I wanna feel better, I really do. Because stress is no joke. And then, on the 21st of May, my cousin died and, um...56 years old and he’s gone now. I know he was dealing with CHF so...life is short.” -Kris D.</i>
<ol start="8">
 	<li>What were some challenges you faced with this project? With taking your BP?</li>
</ol>
<i>“Getting the routine of getting it started and doing it every day” -Sharon E.</i>
<ol start="9">
 	<li>What were some successes?</li>
</ol>
<i>“Well, the biggest success is getting my BP under control to where I know the things that I ought to do and I know the things I should not do as far as the things I shouldn’t eat or how much of the things I shouldn’t eat. I should implement more fruits and vegetables, less fried foods, more baked foods or grilled foods. And cut out a lot of the pork and beef. And...I might hate myself for saying it...and the sweets. Every once in awhile brother, every once in awhile.” -Jarvis J.</i>

<i>“Having someone as an advocate for your health.” -Sharon E.</i>
<ol start="10">
 	<li>What’s the most important thing you’ve learned during our time together? What are your takeaways?</li>
</ol>
<i>“It’s, man, I’m thankful for...really, really [helped] me. From the starting, you know, I’m kind of, man, I was busy. Make a lot of money doing my job. See, now I know, money is nothing. Take care of myself and my family...you know, that’s the first priority. My kids, we used to have soda all the time in this house. They can drink soda once a while but I tell them, don’t bring any soda. You guys have to drink water.” -Toutai H.</i>
<ol start="11">
 	<li>What would you like your provider to know about this project?</li>
</ol>
<i>“That it will save lives. It will save people from having aneurysms, strokes, heart attacks. All they have to do is give the program a chance to work for them and once they give the program a chance to work for them, they will see the changes in their lives.” -Jarvis J.</i>

<i>“That it needs to continue. More people need to be made aware and have the advantage of being involved in it.” -Susan B.</i>

<i>“That this project should continue, if possible. If not by you, someone else come in. I think it should continue because it’s very important, like I said, for the patient to have that 1-on-1 with someone else besides the physician. Because sometimes when you go to your physician’s appointment, you’re basically being rushed and they’re not, you know, really listening or really concerned.” -Kris D.</i>

<i>“It’s a good program. They need to keep it. It helps to have someone come in and teach you things you don’t know nothing about like exercising, how to eat, how to stretch, how to breathe.” -Linda H.</i>

<i>“Most of us are seniors, and they have to have motivation to do something. And your visits and talking and stuff like that gives them company and helps motivate them.” -Sharon E.</i>
<ol start="12">
 	<li>Will you continue to do the things you’ve learned from this project?</li>
</ol>
<i>“Yes I will. Even after you guys are gone and the next group of young people come in, I will be a part of it.” -Jarvis J.</i>

<i>“Yes, absolutely. Including taking my blood pressure” -Susan B.</i>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Rachel Hull, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, '19
<p style="padding-left:30px">Author's Note</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px">"<span style="font-weight:400">I decided to write this piece after stumbling across several news articles in October of this year heralding the birth of the first ever 'three-parent baby' and thinking to myself that something seemed to be missing in these stories. What started as some casual digging into the history of three-parent babies soon turned into a more general investigation of assisted reproductive technologies. The information I found was not only interesting but also very pertinent, as new advances could increase the role these technologies play in our society.</span>"</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><!--more--></p>
<b>Introduction and background information</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been linked to diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Leigh syndrome, and Pearson syndrome [1]. In consideration of this fact, several techniques have been developed to either partially or completely replace mtDNA in embryos. One of these techniques, called spindle nuclear transfer (SNT), made headlines in September when news surfaced that five months earlier, it had been used to produce a healthy human baby [2]. Though several publications called him the first ever “three-parent baby,” he is in fact not the only individual who technically has DNA from three people. He is merely the first baby to be born via SNT. Researchers have been dabbling with other mitochondrial replacement techniques for years, and in light of SNT’s recent debut into the public arena, an overview of these techniques seems more relevant than ever.</span>

<b>Ooplasmic transfer</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">The field of mitochondrial replacement techniques began with an investigation of mouse zygotes in the 1990s. Ooplasmic transfer (OT), as the name implies, involves transplanting the cytoplasm from a donor to recipient oocyte, and early research showed that having these oocytes at the same developmental stage was key [3]. In that same decade, clinical embryologist Jacques Cohen and colleagues began experimental trials at Saint Barnabas Medical Center with human patients for whom</span><i><span style="font-weight:400"> in vitro </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">fertilization had not been successful. The team transferred 5-15% of donor cytoplasm, which contains healthy mitochondria, into recipient oocytes through either electrofusion or injection. The recipient oocytes were then fertilized [4]. Cohen and his team performed this procedure 37 times between 1996 and 2001, resulting in the birth of 17 babies for 13 patients [5]. In 2001, however, the Federal Drug Administration ruled that clinics performing OT on patients would require an Investigational New Drug Application, which was never approved [6].</span>

<b>Germinal vesicle transfer</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">In germinal vesicle transfer (GVT), another mitochondrial replacement technique, the oocyte nucleus </span><span style="font-weight:400">—</span> <span style="font-weight:400">also known as the germinal vesicle (GV) </span><span style="font-weight:400">— </span><span style="font-weight:400">is removed from a donor’s oocyte and transferred into a recipient’s enucleated oocyte. The reconstructed oocyte is then matured </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">in vitro </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">and, finally, fertilized. This technique has primarily attracted scientists looking for a way to overcome aneuploidy, or an abnormal number of chromosomes, which is associated with aberrant meiotic spindle morphology in oocytes and is a major cause of infertility in older women. The potential applications for GVT with relation to mitochondrial diseases are clear. Since the donor’s oocytes have normal nuclear DNA and the recipient’s oocytes have normal mtDNA, this technique could theoretically produce a healthy baby. One significant concern, however, is that mutated mitochondria adjacent to the GV in the patient’s oocytes would likely be carried over to the reconstructed oocytes. To reduce this risk, new methods must be developed to remove the donor’s mtDNA before performing GVT [7].</span>

<b>Pronuclear transfer</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Pronuclear transfer (PNT) dates back to 1983. This technique begins with the removal of the karyoplast, which consists of pronuclei and a small volume of membrane-enclosed cytoplasm, from a patient’s zygote. The karyoplast is then inserted into and fused with a recipient’s enucleated zygote using an inactivated Sendai virus or electric pulse [8]. Like GVT, however, PNT still holds the risk that mutated mtDNA from the donor could be carried over to the recipient [9]; a recent study suggests that even 1% carry-over could have disastrous consequences [10]. In addition, the use of zygotes rather than unfertilized oocytes raises ethical concerns that must be addressed if this technique is to be widely used [8].</span>

<b>Spindle nuclear transfer</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">SNT garnered public attention in September when it came out that five months earlier, it had been used for the first time to facilitate the birth of a baby boy. The boy’s mother carries a mutation that causes the neurodegenerative disorder Leigh syndrome. She and her husband thus contacted Dr. John Zhang, a fertility doctor at New Hope Fertility Center, looking for a solution [2, 11]. What he proposed was SNT, a specifically timed technique performed when a patient’s oocyte is at the metaphase stage of meiosis II, when the chromosomes are lined up across the middle of the cell held in place by the spindle. At this time, the nuclear genome is removed from the patient’s oocyte and inserted into a recipient’s enucleated oocyte, then fertilized [8]. Because the patient’s oocyte chromosomes are not surrounded by a definitive nuclear membrane, specialized techniques are needed to visualize the spindle and chromosomes during manipulation. The intense precision required for SNT is a double-edged sword: it minimizes mtDNA carry-over, but is also extremely technically demanding [12, 13]. </span>

<b>Conclusion and future outlook</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Alas, the boy born in April 2016 is not the first ever “three-parent baby,” as he is not the first human to have been born from a mitochondrial replacement technique. In addition, some have pointed out that since mtDNA makes up just 0.1% of a person’s overall genome and has no effect on identity, it would perhaps be erroneous to even say that a baby produced through SNT has three parents [14, 15]. The news of this baby’s birth has generated more questions than answers, raising debate about the ethics, safety, and efficacy of not only SNT, but the other techniques as well. These methods each show promise in some way. More advances must be made, however, before any of them can be unquestionably viewed as a viable way to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. </span>

<p style="padding-left:30px"><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="font-weight:400">After researching Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) treatment methods for a UWP 104F assignment, I learned that current FXTAS therapeutics is limited to symptomatic treatment. Most articles emphasized the need to better characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying FXTAS development to develop drugs specifically for FXTAS. Therefore, I questioned what researchers currently know regarding molecular events that lead to FXTAS signs and symptoms and how this knowledge can aid in drug therapies. This motivated me to prepare a literary review, intended to educate and inform practicing clinicians, especially neurologists and psychologists, about recent findings and the future directions for FXTAS research. For this assignment, we were expected to synthesize recent articles and provide relevant information for clinical practice. Specifically, I wanted clinicians to gain a better understanding of a primary focus within FXTAS research—molecular triggering events—and importantly, how this research relates to clinical treatment of FXTAS.</span></p>
<!--more--><strong>I. </strong><b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Discovered in 2001, Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) was identified as a late-onset, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, typically affecting males over the age of 55 (1). FXTAS is linked to a dominant mutation in the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> gene, located on the X chromosome (1). This leads to higher disease penetrance in males—approximately 45% in males compared to 16% in females. In the United States, more than 1 million individuals are impacted by FXTAS (2). Core clinical features of FXTAS include intention tremor, gait ataxia, cognitive decline and dementia, and these symptoms progressively become more debilitating throughout time. Unfortunately, a cure still remains unknown, and thus, advanced research continues, emphasizing the molecular processes that underlie FXTAS to pioneer drug development. Ideally, once molecular events are better characterized, therapies can be developed to specifically target those processes.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">At the molecular level, FXTAS affects carriers of a small mutation, also called a premutation, in the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> gene. Normally, individuals have less than 55 CGG repeats in the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> gene, but premutation carriers have between 55-200 CGG repeats (1). This repeat expansion leads to increased levels of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA, yet decreased levels of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (3). Originally, studies suggested that the high levels of mRNA caused the symptoms of FXTAS. However, recently, a competing hypothesis has been proposed, involving a toxic protein produced by repeat-associated non-AUG translation (RAN). Therefore, this review will focus on describing these two leading toxic processes—RNA-mediated toxicity and RAN protein toxicity—to better characterize FXTAS pathogenesis and, ultimately, address therapeutic implications. This article will first discuss the molecular events involved in the disease, including the original hypothesis—RNA-mediated toxicity— and the recent hypothesis—RAN protein toxicity. Lastly, this review will examine therapeutic perspectives given our knowledge about these molecular processes.</span>

<b>II. Molecular Triggering Events</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">To advance therapeutics, FXTAS research capitalizes on understanding the underlying molecular processes that lead to FXTAS pathogenesis. Thus, this section discusses the two leading proposed molecular mechanisms that may lead to FXTAS signs and symptoms.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight:400">RNA-mediated toxicity</span></i>

<span style="font-weight:400">The earlier hypothesis investigates the unique molecular pathology of FXTAS. FXTAS patients and premutation carriers exhibit elevated </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA levels by as much as 10-fold, suggesting that regular transcriptional control is reduced (4-5). Importantly, the expanded CGG repeat in the mRNA transcripts excessively binds one or more proteins (6). However, by sequestering proteins, the proteins’ normal cellular function is blocked and prevented, leading to functional deficiencies within the cell (6). These proteins include DNA repair proteins, transcriptional control proteins, and proteins involved in processing microRNAs (miRNA) (6).  Several of these “RNA binding” proteins bound to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA have been identified in the neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS—ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions. Previous studies demonstrate that these inclusions may be positively correlated with clinical FXTAS symptoms (7). Therefore, identifying colocalized sequestered proteins attached to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA with ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions further validates and strengthens this model (5-6). Scientists first proposed that one or more of the aforementioned “RNA binding” proteins is/are acting to mediate the effect of abnormal mRNA levels, which cause FXTAS development. Sequestering these specific proteins leads to toxic RNA that may underlie the neurological impairment, cell loss, and brain atrophy in FXTAS patients (6-7).</span>

<i><span style="font-weight:400">RAN protein toxicity</span></i>

<span style="font-weight:400">Recently, a competing hypothesis has emerged, involving unconventional translation, referred to as RAN translation. In this second post-transcriptional mechanism,  the expanded CGG repeat is included in the peptide product, either FMRpolyG or FMRpolyA, and results in either a polyglycine or a polyalanine stretch, respectively. This occurs because translation of the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA begins at a point upstream of the expanded CGG repeat instead of at the expected AUG start codon (7). Typically, standard translation machinery would bypass the CGG repeat region, as it is located in the 5’ UTR (1). However, RAN translation shifts the frame of the normal coding sequence. Interestingly, two possible shifts can occur during RAN translation and can recognize the expanded repeat sequence as either GCC, coding for glycine, or GCG, coding for alanine (7). Although both shifts occur, the shift resulting in a polyglycine-containing peptide, FMRpolyG, occurs at higher levels and has been found in intranuclear inclusions (7-8). Recent studies have demonstrated that the peptide product, FMRpolyG, is toxic to cells, causing proteins to misfold and aggregate (7-8). FMRpolyA products are also toxic, but the focus of research remains on FMRpolyG due its higher prevalence and co-localization with inclusions. Thus, it is more likely to participate in FXTAS pathogenesis. More importantly, however, the overall roles of RAN translation and these unexpected toxic peptides need to be further unraveled, as this research focusing on RAN translation is in its infancy. RAN translation adds another potential toxic mechanism, explaining how the expanded CGG repeat might manifest into the FXTAS clinical phenotype.</span>

<b>III.</b><span style="font-weight:400">         </span><b>Prospects for Drug Development</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Though there is no cure for FXTAS, further elucidation of the RNA- and protein-mediated toxicity mechanisms have opened new perspectives for drug development. Therefore, this section will examine different therapeutic directions and targets, considering the information gleaned through FXTAS research at the molecular level as described above.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight:400">Gene-targeted Therapy</span></i>

<span style="font-weight:400">Because FXTAS is a genetic disorder, drug therapies ideally target genetic components contributing to the development of FXTAS, as employed through genome editing and gene silencing approaches. Genome editing explores the possibility of removing the expanded CGG trinulecotide repeat, which would address the core cause of FXTAS pathology. Essentially, it would correct the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> gene. However, this is still a futuristic approach because currently, there is no technology available to accomplish this in non-dividing cells, like neurons (9).</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Contrarily, gene silencing techniques are available for patients participating in a clinical trial and are more actively employed for other microsatellite diseases, mainly Huntington’s disease. Though gene silencing is currently being studied for patients with Huntington’s disease, it can easily be adapted for use in FXTAS patients, who also suffer from a trinucleotide repeat disorder (10). This approach aims to silence the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> gene, eliminating toxic mRNA and FMRP. There is concern, though, because certain levels of FMRP need to be preserved for normal cognitive function. Similarly, therapy that targets the degradation of toxic </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA experiences this fundamental conflict between removing toxic mRNA and maintaining sufficient levels of FMRP. Both gene silencing and degradation of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA approaches have the capacity to prevent both RNA-mediated and RAN protein-mediated toxicity, but if </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA is completely degraded, no FMRP can be produced (9). The absence of FMRP is known to cause FXS (Fragile-X Syndrome) and therefore, this approach may not be beneficial for FXTAS patients and premutation carriers, as it could lead to another Fragile-X disorder (1). Instead, a modest reduction in </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA levels may help the cell eliminate toxic RNA and RAN protein aggregates while preserving sufficient FMRP levels for cognitive activity (12).</span>

<i><span style="font-weight:400">Protein-targeted Therapy</span></i>

<span style="font-weight:400">Given recent findings, FMRpolyG is now also a therapeutic target due to its intracellular toxicity. In the cell, proteasomes mark FMRpolyG for degradation, yet simultaneously FMRpolyG inhibits this activity, blocking degradation and ultimately leading to its intracellular accumulation (7). Therefore, increased proteasome activity could prevent this toxic process (9). In fact, a recent study observed that increased proteasome activity led to degradation of toxic proteins, reduced aggregate formation and increased cell survival (11). This evidence suggests that elevated proteasome activity poses strong therapeutic potential. However, there are difficulties regarding the long-term toxicity of elevated proteasome activity and cellular adaptation leading to treatment resistance. Increased levels of protein degradation may be deleterious to cells. Therefore, it is critical to target a specific process in the protein degradation process, because this allows for higher regulation and control (9). Overall, this method may prove better suited to patients because it avoids the intrinsic </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA and FMRP problem, unlike gene-targeted therapy.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400"><strong>IV.</strong>  </span><b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight:400">Primarily, there are two toxic mechanisms leading to FXTAS pathogenesis: RNA gain-of-function and protein gain-of-function. The RNA gain-of-function hypothesis consists of the sequestration of RNA-binding proteins specifically to the expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat region in the 5’ UTR. This results in the lack of required proteins for tasks such as gene expression and mRNA processing, which are essential for proper cellular function (6-7). The protein gain-of-function hypothesis was recently explored due to further understanding of non-conventional RAN translation mechanisms. RAN translation incorporates the expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat in the peptide product, which was previously thought to be untranslated (7). This leads to toxic peptide products that are prone to misfolding and aggregating within the cell (7-8). Though presented separately, the RNA-mediated and RAN protein-mediated toxicity mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and, in fact, may have synergistic effects (7, 9). Thus, FXTAS pathogenesis would best be described as a two-hit model—toxic RNA and toxic protein both may be critical for FXTAS development (7).</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Although these two toxic mechanisms have been further characterized in research, there is no easy drug target for FXTAS treatment. Fundamentally, gene-targeted therapy—mainly genome editing and gene silencing—would prevent both RNA-mediated and RAN protein-mediated toxicity because it would target the root cause of FXTAS (i.e. expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat). However, this method is problematic. Both technologies remove or silence toxic </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> mRNA, which leads to diminished levels of FMRP. Therefore, drugs specifically targeting RAN protein toxicity may be more sensible, since they would avoid the fundamental conflict between promoting </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">FMR1</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> degradation and preserving sufficient levels FMRP for cognitive function.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">FXTAS research has made tremendous progress in recent years and has helped advance drug development possibilities and avenues. However, further insight is needed to explore the role of RAN translation and the resulting toxic peptide, FMRpolyG, in FXTAS pathology. RAN translation has important implications for FXTAS patients and premutation carriers and may be a promising target for the development of drug therapies. The reported findings included in this review excite researchers to continue investigation to ultimately discover a standardized cure for FXTAS.</span>

<p style="padding-left:30px"><b>Author’s Note</b><span style="font-weight:400">: </span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px"><span style="font-weight:400">"Many areas of employment, especially within health care, require employees to take a test to see if they have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB). Today, it is believed that one third of the world’s population is infected with some form of TB. However, not many people truly understand what tuberculosis is or what it does. I hope that after reading this, you will have a better understanding of TB."</span><!--more--></p>
<b>Pathogenesis</b><span style="font-weight:400">:</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">When TB was an epidemic in the United States during the early 1900’s, many people nicknamed the disease “consumption” because of how it “eats you away.” For those with active TB, some symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats and weight loss. Most cases of tuberculosis are caused by the bacterium, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. Although there are other </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Mycobacterium</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> species that cause TB, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is the main causative agent. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">M. tuberculosis </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">has many unique characteristics that make it stand out. A notable feature is the bacterium’s thick, waxy, mycolic acid coating, which plays a vital role in its survival within the human body. Although most bacteria can survive for a few days on dry surfaces such as a tabletop, the waxy coat allows </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> to survive for weeks in a dry state. This also helps increase resistance to dehydration and chemical damage, which can prevent antibiotics from killing the organism (Lampart, 2002).</span>
<ol>
 	<li><i><span style="font-weight:400">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> prefers to colonize in the lungs because it is highly aerobic; therefore it grows best in highly oxygenated areas. The lungs are responsible for allowing oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream, requiring it to be sterile. To retain sterility, the lungs have their own defense system to prevent and clear pathogens. An important component of this defense system is the alveolar macrophages, which detect pathogens and eradicate them. However, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> can easily evade the immune system by surviving and multiplying inside of these alveolar macrophages (Keane et al., 1997). The infected macrophages can only migrate to the nearest lymph node and hope that the bacteria will be contained by other immune cells.</span></li>
</ol>
<b>Diagnosis</b><span style="font-weight:400">:</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">There are two methods commonly used to detect TB, but they are not 100% accurate and both methods have specific requirements. If a positive result is read, other exams are needed in order to determine if it is a true positive.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">First is the purified protein derivative (PPD) skin method, which tests the inflammatory response against the purified tuberculin protein to see if the individual has previously been exposed to the bacteria. The test requires an individual to have a healthy immune system and to follow up with a healthcare professional 48 to 72 hours later to observe the inflammation response (Dacso, 1990). Although the PPD skin test is the most common due to its simple protocol, the results can be inaccurate if the patient has a poor immune system or if they are already vaccinated against TB.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">The second method of detection is a blood test called the Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). Interferon gamma (INγ) is a cytokine, which is important for activating macrophages and performing other functions in the immune system. Similar to the PPD skin test, the IGRA tests for a specific response against the bacteria. This is to determine if the individual has previously been exposed to </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. Although the IGRA is meant to be more accurate, the blood samples must be processed immediately, as any delay can lead to a false result.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">It is important to note that most people who are infected with TB don’t get sick as long as the immune system is not compromised. These people are classified as having inactive or latent TB because the immune system and bacteria are at a standstill. The bacteria is controlled, but cannot be eradicated. People who are TB positive are often required to do an x-ray of the chest to test for active TB. In a patient with active TB, the chest radiograph shows 2-4 mm nodules throughout the lungs, which resemble bird seeds (Hussain et al., 2007). However, identifying </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> in a sputum sample is the true diagnostic test for TB.The main difference between active and inactive TB is that inactive TB is contained and is not spread around the lungs. When doctors look at the radiograph of someone with inactive TB, they look for the GHON (pronounced “g-OH-n”) complex, a lesion near the lymph node of the lung formed from the walled-off bacteria. For active TB, bird seed like nodules should be spread throughout the lungs.</span>

<b>Treatment and Prevention</b><span style="font-weight:400">:</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">TB can only be spread through the air or from the saliva of an individual who is already infected with active TB; individuals with inactive TB are not contagious. However, even if the bacteria is contained in people with inactive TB, there is a slight chance that reactivation can occur. Therefore, people with active or reactivated TB are often those with compromised immune systems. Such cases are common in patients who are Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive and in those who use steroids. </span>

<span style="font-weight:400">There are several antibiotic treatments to control the disease. If active TB is found, the patient is often put on several antibiotic treatments for 5-6 months. Healthcare professionals stress that treatment must be administered properly to prevent drug-resistant bacteria from appearing. The misuse of antibiotics allows surviving bacteria to reproduce and drug-resistant bacteria to adapt, making antibiotics useless. In order to prevent future drug-resistant TB from appearing, it is our responsibility to be educated and to educate others about the risks of improper usage of antibiotics.</span>

<b>Takeaway</b><span style="font-weight:400">:</span>

<span style="font-weight:400">Tuberculosis is fascinating and has an immense amount of significance in today’s world. In summary, TB is a bacterial infection of the lungs that many people are able to resist unless the immune system is compromised. The PPD and IGRA tests check for previous infection of TB. However, only an x-ray exam of the chest or a culturing of bacteria is sufficient to diagnose for TB. There are treatment options for active TB, but they must be applied properly to prevent drug-resistant bacteria from evolving.</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“I chose to write this review for my UWP 104F after reading about potential treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. As this is a disease that affects such a wide variety of people, and currently has no cure, I wanted to educate myself about the developments regarding it. Although the potential treatments are still under investigation, they provide hope for people affected by a currently incurable disease.”</span>

<!--more-->

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a terminal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline. As the most common cause of dementia, AD affects over 24 million people worldwide, and this number is only expected to increase due to greater life expectancies (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Although this disease affects a great number of people, there is currently much that remains unknown about it, particularly the causes and potential treatments. While there seems to be a consensus among researchers and clinicians that the disease is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid plaque accumulation in the brain, their causes and implications are still under investigation (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2-5)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Furthermore, although old age is identified as posing the greatest risk for disease development, it appears that other factors, such as genetic mutations, oxidative stress, diet, and certain medical conditions, may also play a role (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5,6)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of this literature review is to examine how oxidative stress, particularly due to deficiencies in vitamins D and E and diabetes mellitus (DM), may lead to the development of AD, and to evaluate the implications that these findings may have on further research. This paper will first address these risk factors for the disease, and will then discuss how knowledge about them can potentially lead to targets for treatment. </span>

<b>Oxidative Stress as a Cause of AD</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Although old age is known to be the most common cause of AD, it appears that other factors may also be responsible for the cognitive decline that leads to the development of the disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as one of these factors, as the accumulation of free radical species induces damage in vital macromolecules, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,7)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Though the mechanism is not fully understood, this seems to induce inflammatory reactions from the brain, leading to damage and the formation of beta-amyloid plaques (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">8)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. While oxidative stress has a multitude of causes, there are three in particular that may be positively correlated with the risk for AD: vitamin D deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, and diabetes mellitus.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitamin D Deficiency</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Vitamin D has been shown to have a protective effect against cognitive decline in the brain, as it appears to prevent neurodegeneration due to its antioxidant effects</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Thus, it is not surprising that individuals who are deficient in vitamin D have been found to have an increased risk of developing AD (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5,6)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. This link was shown to hold true in a study of 1,658 U.S. adults who initially did not have any form of dementia</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The researchers followed up with the study participants after an average of 5.6 years and found that 102 of them had developed AD, and that there was a positive correlation with vitamin D deficiency (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Another study conducted in Italy showed the same results: vitamin D deficiency was responsible for a larger number of participants developing AD after a 6 year follow up (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Similarly, a different study found AD risk to be greater in northern regions compared to southern in Italy, New Zealand, and Chile (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">9)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. While this trend initially did not seem to relate to vitamin D deficiency, it was noted that people in the northern regions were more likely to be deficient in the vitamin, thus further demonstrating its role in AD development (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">9)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">While these studies provide evidence that individuals lacking in vitamin D have an increased risk of AD, there may be other influences present that could be affecting the risk. Additionally, most studies only examine elderly individuals with this particular deficiency, so it is unknown if insufficient amounts of the vitamin throughout life is the issue, or whether a short-term deficiency later in life is enough to increase the risk (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6,9)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, the correlation between AD and vitamin D does seem to support that oxidative stress may cause the disease (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5,6,9)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vitamin E Deficiency</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Like vitamin D, a lack of vitamin E also seems to pose a greater risk for development of AD (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3,10-12)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Vitamin E refers to eight different compounds, four tocopherols and four tocotrienols, all of which appear to promote antioxidation in the body (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">16)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Deficiencies in the tocopherols, especially alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, may have a link to AD. Lack of alpha-tocopherol seems to result in nerve cell damage and death, as this deficiency has been found to cause less branching of the dendrites in Purkinje fibers, significantly decreasing communication throughout the brain (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3,10,12)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Additionally, deficiencies of both alpha- and gamma-tocopherol may lead to neuroinflammation due to oxidative stress, further enhancing cognitive decline and, consequently, AD (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3,8,10,12)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, other research has shown vitamin E levels alone to have no impact on AD risk (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,13)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Some studies have reported that there is no significant difference in serum vitamin E levels in patients with and without AD, while others have reported that the difference only occurs in individuals that genetically have a higher risk for AD (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">13)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. A few studies have found a correlation between vitamin E deficiency and the ApoE4 gene variant, but research in this area is limited, as many people do not know that they have this mutation</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Thus, due to the conflicting evidence on the relationship between vitamin E and AD, more studies are necessary.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Hyperglycemia experienced in patients with DM may cause oxidative stress due to the accumulation of superoxides (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4,14)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. This oxidative stress can then manifest in the brain, leading to damage and death of neurons. Therefore, it follows that patients with DM may have an increased risk of developing AD, as demonstrated in various studies (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4,15) </span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In some cases, it appears that the risk for AD doubles in patients with DM (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">The relationship between AD and DM was further explored in terms of cardiovascular disease. It has been hypothesized that cardiovascular disease increases the risk for AD, but upon further analysis, it appeared that this correlation may be due to the factors that pose risks for cardiovascular disease, such as DM. However, a study testing this hypothesis did not find a significant relationship between AD and DM (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">15)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. While it did seem that DM may increase the risk for dementia, there was no increase of plaques or tangles in the brains of diabetic patients, and thus no indication of an increased risk for AD. Consequently, more research in this area is necessary due to the opposing findings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Since oxidative stress has been identified as a potential cause for AD, treatment options targeting this are currently under investigation. Both vitamin and herbal supplements may be able to prevent or lessen the effects of AD due to their antioxidative effects, and thus are being examined for their efficacy (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">7,11,16,17)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Dietary Antioxidants</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Vitamins with antioxidant effects, such as vitamin E, have shown success in reducing cognitive decline in some individuals (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">16)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Consuming increased amounts of vitamin E, both through supplements and food sources, may lead to a decreased risk for development of dementia (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">11,16)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In a specific analysis of the components of vitamin E, it appears that the increased presence of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol reduces the progression of mild cognitive impairment to AD, although it is dependent on the dose, which varies based on the person.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is contrasting evidence that vitamin E may not make a difference at all, or that it may actually be harmful (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,16)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In a study conducted on 769 individuals, there were no significant differences between the placebo group and the vitamin E supplement group in terms of their development of AD (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">16)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Furthermore, one study found that vitamin E doses above 800 IU/d have been shown to cause death</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, since other studies cited that doses of 1000 IU/d prevented cognitive decline, more research is necessary in order to fully evaluate the effects of the vitamin.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Herbal Supplements</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, some herbal supplements may also play a role in reducing cognitive decline, as they contain flavonoids that can function as antioxidants (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">7,17)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Pomegranate peel extract as a treatment has been successful in reducing the amount of plaque formation without causing harm to the liver, which is a concern in some herbal supplements (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">17)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Similarly, green tea pills seemed to have a beneficial effect on people with AD, as they reduced oxidative damage in many areas of the body, including nervous tissue (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">7)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. While both of these supplements appear to reduce oxidative damage, more clinical trials are necessary, as there currently is not enough evidence to determine their efficacy.</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">The damage of nerve cells and accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques attributed to oxidative stress has caused clinicians and researchers to investigate the link between oxidative stress and AD (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,7,8)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. While vitamin D deficiency appears to be linked to AD due to the general neuroprotective effects that the vitamin has, vitamin E deficiency seems to be linked to Purkinje fiber damage and neuronal death (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,3,6,9.10,11,16)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Furthermore, the hyperglycemia faced by many individuals with DM may cause accumulation of superoxides in the brain, ultimately leading to damage and death of neurons (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4,14)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In all three of these conditions, the oxidative stress experienced by the individuals appears to be positively correlated with an increased risk for AD (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3-6,9-11,14)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, there are studies that present results that disagree with these trends, highlighting the complexity of this condition and its potential causes (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,13,15)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Consideration of oxidative stress as a cause of AD has led to treatment options specifically targeting these areas. Vitamin E supplements have been given to patients due to their antioxidant effects, and while some trials have reported positive results, others have reported no benefit, or even negative results (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,11,13)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In addition, some herbal supplements, such as green tea extract and pomegranate peels, have been shown to reduce oxidative damage and thus delay the effects and reduce the damage of AD (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">7,17)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. However, more clinical trials are necessary in order to fully evaluate the benefits of supplements, as there is a limited amount of evidence available.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, the advancements in research of AD leading to the discovery of oxidative damage as a potential cause for the disease have uncovered many possible treatment options. Further research in this area is necessary to identify a potential cure for a disease that affects so many people.</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“The controversial topic of a human head transplant caught me by surprise when I read about it in the news. I was curious about the psychological, immunological, and technical complications of this procedure. After researching it, I became more knowledgeable and open-minded towards it.” </span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">In 2013, physician Dr. Sergio Canavero proposed to attempt the world’s first human head transplant as a last treatment option for patients with diseases that infect their body, but leave their brains healthy. The volunteer is Valery Spiridinov, a 31-year old man suffering from Werdnig-Hoffman disease, a disorder characterized by muscle atrophy. An outline of the procedure was published in the International Journal of Surgery.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Canavero’s paper first describes the procedure of a head-body transplant performed by Dr. Robert White in a Rhesus monkey in the 1970’s. The monkey appeared normal after the transplant in all measures, but survived for only 8 days due to the lack of technology to re-connect the spinal cord. Now, nearly five decades later, Canavero’s protocol includes more advanced technology. First, an especially sharp blade is used to sever the recipient’s head from his body. A brain-dead donor’s body, whose immunotype is matched to the recipient, is selected. After the recipient’s head is drained of blood, it, along with the spinal cord of the donor’s body, is chilled to temperatures of 12-15</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ο</span><span style="font-weight: 400">C. Studies have shown the ability to restore functions of the brain with arrested circulatory blood flow without neurological damage within 45 minutes. The rest of the recipient's body, however, is kept at normal temperature to maintain organ functions. Appropriate monitoring of the organs, as well as injection of anesthesia and antibiotics, is applied. Spinal cord, vessels, and veins of head and body are subsequently sewn together within 1-2 minutes. A solution that facilitates in membrane fusion and acts as a neuroprotectant is applied through an IV into the bloodstream. Immunosuppressant drugs, identical to those taken by organ transplant patients, are used. The patient is provided with psychological therapy during recovery.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Two reviews by Furr and colleagues published in 2017 provided additional methods for the most difficult part of the surgery: re-connection of the spinal cord. The methods were successful in patients who suffer from spinal injuries. Additionally, it emphasized the maintenance of an intact blood-brain barrier as critical in preventing access of immunoregulatory cells to the brain, which lowers the chances of the body rejecting the brain. They also proposed manipulating the donor body’s bone marrow cell precursors of immune cells to recognize antigens of the face and head. The psychological risks the patient would encounter are currently unknown because a self-body dissonance as large as the one that the patient will experience has never been encountered. Although, enhancement of life quality reported by patients who underwent face transplants indicated a possible positive outcome. More research on the brain immunology axis was suggested. Additionally, opponents in the bioethics department pointed to the inability to provide Mr. Spiridinov with the full risks of the procedure, to ensure informed consent, as a large red flag.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A successful head transplant has enormous implications on the possibilities provided by science and technology in the future. Currently, 800 physicians and health-care professionals have joined Dr. Canavero’s team. The surgery is scheduled to take place in December 2017.</span>

<strong>Author's Note</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“I became interested in vector-borne diseases in Spring of 2016, when I conducted an independent study on the ethical advancement of genetically modifying technology. I discussed the potential application of CRISPR to mosquitoes, primarily </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Aedes aegypti</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, in the effort to combat dengue. Throughout my extensive research, the danger posed by mosquitoes was commonly emphasized by diverse sources. It was thus surprising to read that Microsoft’s Project Premonition is based on the assertion that mosquitoes can be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">useful </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">to us in our quest to control vector-borne diseases. My intrigue led me to research the project further to better understand its method, application, and potential.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Vector-borne epidemics have become increasingly common across the globe, causing over 1 million deaths and affecting over 1 billion people annually [8]. As such, efforts to mitigate their spread have gained momentum. Due to the fact that numerous emerging vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and zika are transmitted primarily by mosquitoes, many disease-control strategies have focused on minimizing mosquito populations [8]. Among the diverse strategies that have been tested and employed on mosquitoes are genetically modifying them with gene-editing techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) or release of insects with dominant lethality (RIDL), altering their habitats and resources by introducing competitor or predatory species, and using insecticides. Each of these methods have been met with varying degrees of success and concern for the safety of their use [3,5,6]. One particular team has undertaken a different approach – rather than attempting to combat mosquito populations, Microsoft’s Project Premonition seeks to learn from the valuable information they can provide us. It does so with the vision that future vector-borne outbreaks may not only be controlled, but avoided altogether [7]. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">It is unusual to suggest that mosquitoes, being the primary vectors of harmful infectious diseases, may be used to prevent such diseases. Since its inception in 2015, Project Premonition, led by Microsoft researcher Ethan Jackson, has worked to create a system that uses data collected from mosquitoes to detect pathogens before they cause widespread outbreaks. This has been difficult to do thus far, mainly because of the difficulty in collecting reliable data using current traditional techniques. Project Premonition aims to override this obstacle by effectively finding “mosquito hotspots” with drones rather than satellites, collecting mosquitoes with robotic traps that are equipped to lure and identify specimens, and detecting both known and unknown pathogens with a metagenomics approach that involves gene sequencing the collected mosquito DNA with a SNAP alignment tool, a recent development made collaboratively by Microsoft, UC Berkeley, and UCSF [1,2,4,7]. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The project aims to acquire data on mosquito genetics and behavior across various species, as well as environmental data pertaining to natural factors such as time, wind, temperature, and light levels. The data will be analyzed collectively to visualize patterns in mosquitoes and the spread of vector-borne diseases, which will then be used to predict oncoming epidemics. In doing so, the project can enable disease-mitigation strategies to work more efficiently, simply by alerting them to certain diseases that are gaining prevalence. The project may also enable diseases to be prevented completely [4,7].</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">While Project Premonition is not a solution to the vector-borne epidemics currently affecting world populations, it offers itself as a potentially valuable method for disease prevention in the near future. The collaborative effort between Microsoft and various academic and research institutions, such as Johns Hopkins University, UCSF, UC Riverside, and UC Berkeley, highlights the project’s multidimensional and innovative approach, which may help ensure its practicality in terms of cost, safety, and efficacy. Despite its atypical attitude toward disease-spreading mosquitoes, Project Premonition’s ability to recognize the usefulness of mosquitoes as well as their imposing threat is precisely what makes its endeavor promising [4,7]. </span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“This started as a case study I wrote on my friend’s chronic kidney disease for UWP104F. She was diagnosed during our freshman year; and I see the impact of her weekly dialysis on her family, diet, and college schedule. Knowing that a kidney transplant will greatly improve her health, I researched the processes one would undertake to donate their kidney. As it turns out, there are numerous factors one should consider. My article briefs on the current state of kidney donation. It is an expression of my amazement of turning our bodies into tools.”</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">We have two hands. We have two eyes and two ears. We have a pair of lungs and a pair of feet. Often, we overlook why some of our body parts come in pairs. Even more so if we’re left with one. If I were to lose one or both, could you share yours? Are our bodies purposefully designed with spare parts?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting just below our stomach, sandwiching the left and right ends of our small intestine, are two fist-sized, bean-shaped organs that drain to one bladder. The kidneys are the filters of our body and the gateway to the urinary system. As harmful salts and metabolites in our blood sift through the filtering nephrons, they are pumped into the bladder and become urine. One kidney can accomplish this task. But two kidneys double the body’s filtering power, which underpins the congruency of all harmonious body pairings. However, when both kidneys are dysfunctional, blood filtration halts. Bile and ions recirculate in the blood and poison the organs from which they came. Urination ceases, and body-wide organ failure ensues.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As the modularity of the human body becomes more apparent to us, we realize that sharing our kidneys is just one of the many humanly attributable acts that we can do for one another. Since the early 1900’s, scientists have been fascinated with giving the organs of brain-dead, effectively deceased people to living patients. In 1954, Dr. Joseph Murray and Dr. David Hume perfected the first living donor kidney transplant between identical twin brothers. Eight years later, the medical pair performed the first deceased donor transplant in a procedure that demonstrated patient-donor kidney compatibility (Barker </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">). The two types of kidney donors offer their advantages and shortcomings. While deceased donors may give up both of their kidneys, living donors can only give one. However, living donors often present stronger, cleaner, and healthier kidneys that are less likely to fail in a recipient’s lifetime (“Living Kidney Donor Network”). Today, many patients in the United States receive new kidneys from deceased donors; however, these donations are currently managed by an overwhelmed and impacted system (Organ Donation and Transplantation Statistics).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which established the guidelines for the nationwide allocation of organs to transplant patients. Part of NOTA’s Title II proposal is the establishment of the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) (Public Interest Law). Today, UNOS maintains the central database of eligible patients waiting for a cadaver’s kidney. But due to the increased demand for kidneys, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UNOS has been stigmatized in pop culture as the ominous “waiting list.” Patients suffer interminable waiting times and dwindling patience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2014, the National Kidney Foundation estimated that of the 100,000 patients that waited in line through UNOS, only 11,570 underwent a transplant. On average, 3,000 new patients were added every month, while the median waiting time for a patient steadily increased to 3.6 years (Organ Donation and Transplantation Statistics). During this time, a patient’s immune system and vasculature will have deteriorated until he or she has become too weak to even undergo a transplant. For this reason, UNOS encourages healthy individuals to consider becoming living kidney donors. UNOS’ homepage greets visitors with an advertisement recruiting living-kidney donations and lists the basic criteria needed by eligible donors (Home | UNOS).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Ideal kidney donors must be at least 18 years of age and free of any health conditions that are difficult to treat, such as AIDS or cancer (Living Donation). Additional requirements vary by a donor’s specific body criteria</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">gender, body weight, usual diet</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">and the state where the surgery will take place. Once evaluated, a donor is matched to a kidney recipient with similar blood and immunological antibodies (Living Donation). Surprisingly, the strict need for perfect donor-recipient pairings has decreased in recent years. With the troubling health statistics of transplant patients, Dr. Karl Womer of Johns Hopkins Medicine believes that “it is really important to have a transplant as soon as possible and with any degree of matching. It’s better to have a transplant than not” (“What Kidney Donors Need to Know”). Donors typically undergo a laparoscopic nephrectomy. Once they are anesthetized, three small incisions are made at-and-around their belly button, where a camera and a hot cauterizing iron are inserted. Surgeons carefully burn all connections to the kidney, and then simply reach in with their hand to grab it. Larger donors may need to have a wider incision for better identification and acquisition of their kidney. After the two-hour surgery, donors recover in the hospital for an additional four to six days (Gupta </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“Living donors recover quickly,” says Dr. Edward Gibney, a nephrologist at Piedmont Atlanta Hospital in Georgia (What It’s Like to Be a Living Kidney Donor). “[Donors] should be able to get back to work and [their] life in just a few weeks.” During this time, the size and filtration rate of the donor’s sole kidney will increase to compensate for the loss of the other kidney. And because the donor and recipient will leave with only one kidney each, both patients will forever need to minimize all dangers that can physically damage their kidney, including lower-back injuries, excessive sodium and alcohol consumption, or misuse of prescribed medication. Although considered very unlikely, complications such as hypertension may arise in both the donor and the recipient but are manageable through healthy diets and moderate exercise. According to the National Kidney Foundation, more than 80% of donors are satisfied with their decision (What to Expect After Donation).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Yet if living donors more effectively rescue transplant-awaiting patients, why are volunteers still limited? Sally Satel, in her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> article “Why People Don’t Donate Their Kidneys,” conveys that people only donate their organs in an “altruistic” context. For instance, families and friends of transplant patients are more willing to donate because of their adherent values of emotional or genetic bonds (Satel). When 47-year-old Karen Shatka was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease—a genetic disorder that caused a fluid-filled cyst to destroy her kidneys (Polycystic Kidney Disease)—eleven of her family members volunteered to donate (Kidney Living Donor Transplant A Case Study).</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Ellen, Karen’s stepsister, was the closest match, and the two underwent surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, in 2012. Ellen says that she is “so blessed to be a living donor for Karen. [She’d] do anything for her” (Kidney Living Donor Transplant A Case Study). But many other diseased kidney patients are not so fortunate. In 2014, 20-year-old Tamara Nguyen was diagnosed with end-stage chronic kidney disease, which meant that numerous factors, such as diet and predisposed hypertension, prompted her kidneys to deteriorate. However, upon learning of her condition, Tamara’s parents and siblings all refused to donate. Tamara believes that, as a Vietnamese woman, her family’s cultural stigmas place her health at a low priority. Instead, Tamara depends on dialysis to filter her blood for two hours, twice a week. She believes that she is better off seeking help from a stranger. In 2016, Nguyen is still on the “waiting list.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When it comes to donating to a stranger, though, Satel laments that some institutions “forbid donors [from receiving] anything of tangible value in return for their lifesaving deeds.” Due to potential complications with the donor’s and recipient’s health, some institutions won’t fund transplant operations and recovery costs. Additionally, it is illegal to sell or purchase organs. NOTA’s “Title III,” the “Prohibition of Organ Purchases,” states that “it shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly… transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce” (Public Interest Law). This is all to say that donors may find difficulty in being rewarded for their generous gift. In fact, donors are largely ignored after their transplant surgery. According to the Living Donation California website, transplant expenses for a kidney donor are covered by the donor’s health insurance; however, subsequent follow-up and check-up services are not, and neither are lost wages from time off work (Who Pays for Living Donation and Kidney Transplants). Essentially, neither the health care providers nor the government will compensate kidney donors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">All limitations considered, perhaps institutions and regulations also bolster the need for donors. If donors are paid for the value of their kidney, then transplantable kidneys will become a purchasable commodity, and a free market for organs will favor patients who can afford them and exclude patients who cannot. Through donors, all patients have an equal opportunity for regaining a normal life. Supporters of such philanthropic approaches include Dr. Paul Dooley and Dr. Jeremiah Lowney. In 2004, the medical pair co-founded the website MatchingDonors.com, where potential organ donors can make an online profile and match with a registered transplant patient. Dr. Dooley was motivated to start MatchingDonors after his father was denied placement onto the UNOS transplant list because, as Dr. Dooley’s website conveys, “the list was so long that by the time a kidney would become available Mr. Dooley’s father would not still be alive” (Organ Donor, Organ Transplant, Organ Donor Services). It is unsuccessful stories such as Dr. Dolley’s that prompted Jacob Halupka, a 38-year-old father of three, to donate to a stranger. In a 2007 interview with People Magazine, Halupka described making his profile on MatchingDonors as “a calling. It’s difficult to read these stories and not want to help” (Kidneys Online). In fact, more and more people like Jacob Halupka are searching for patients-in-need online. In 2011, East Haven, Connecticut mayor Aprile Capone Almon donated one of her kidneys to Carlos Sanchez, a transplant patient she found on Facebook. Mayor Almon responded to Sanchez’s Facebook post with the  message, “Carlos, I’ll get tested, I’ve got two, so what the hell? You can have one” (Facebook Helps Facilitate Organ Donation). Today, MatchingDonors has over 14,000 registered potential donors. Many of the website’s pairings continue to be publicized by CNN, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Huffington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, and television shows like “Hot in Cleveland” (Organ Donor, Organ Transplant, Organ Donor Services). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Clearly, the public is starting to become aware of something marvelous. We know that pairings are a natural component of nature, but as we have learned from the symmetry that underlies our anatomy, we increasingly realize that humans are capable of helping one another on an astonishing level. The decision to donate a kidney comes with an enormous responsibility for both the donor and the recipient. Donors should take into consideration the long-term benefits and risks to their health and wellness. Yet it is amazing that such a decision can even be contemplated by any such organism. Perhaps our organ-sharing abilities are what truly separate humans from other creatures in nature. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">By Bukre Coskun, Cell Biology, ‘18</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Author’s Note: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“The ability to build new organ parts may seem like science fiction, but tissue engineering is a fast-growing field that has already yielded promising results. After reading that congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect, I was compelled to do some research on how tissue engineering has sought to improve existing surgical options. After coming across a couple articles about acellular valve conduits, I decided to report on the research of the University of Minnesota, which was recently published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nature Communications</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.” </span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">Congenital heart defects are a serious and increasingly prevalent problem, with treatment limited to synthetic valve and vessel replacements. The inability of these replacements to grow and respond to their biological environment calls for repeated open-heart surgeries to resize the prosthetics, especially in children. Scientists, led by the University of Minnesota, have recently developed artificial blood vessels that can grow inside the patient. This advancement could potentially eliminate the need for multiple heart surgeries in children with congenital heart defects. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Cardiac defects, such as pulmonary atresia, sometimes require surgery to create a connection between the arteries and left ventricle. Homografts, tailored pulmonary arteries taken from a person who has died, and bovine jugular vein grafts obtained from cows, are the only two materials currently available to form this connection. However, these materials don’t grow with the child, which means that the graft will eventually be too small. The graft will have to be replaced with a larger one at some point as the child “outgrows” the conduit.  Other complications, such as shrinkage of the conduit due to calcification, add to the probability that the child will have to undergo five to seven procedures during their lifetime. A conduit with the ability to grow would greatly benefit children with heart defects. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although there are methods being developed that use autologous cell grafts and polymers, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">acellular</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> graft with growth potential that does not require cells to be isolated from the patient and cultured before implantation. Instead, the patient’s own cells would be able to colonize and grow on the acellular graft post-implantation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">"This might be the first time we have an 'off-the-shelf' material that doctors can implant in a patient, and it can grow in the body," said Robert Tranquillo, who led the research team. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The researchers seeded sheep dermal fibroblast cells into fibrin gel, a biodegradable protein scaffold. The cells secreted extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, which are essential for the regular gene expression, migration, proliferation and differentiation of cells. To form the material into vessel-like structures, the cell-populated gel was wrapped into tiny tubes. Then, the material was put in a bioreactor with the necessary nutrients, which also strengthened and stiffened the cells by keeping them in constant motion. The synthetic blood vessels were finally washed with special detergents to remove all the sheep cells, leaving behind a cell-free protein matrix. Because all cells are efficiently removed, there is no risk of rejection and no need for immunosuppression. The resulting tube, composed of mostly collagen, can be stored until needed for an operation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To test the manufactured blood vessels, the synthetic vessels replaced part of the pulmonary artery in three lambs at five weeks of age. Ultrasound images taken over 50 weeks to monitor the artificial vessels showed that the implanted vessels were successfully populated by the lambs' own cells, allowing the vessel to grow together with the recipient into adulthood. In fact, the collagen protein increased 465 percent by week 50, confirming that the vessel had not simply expanded but had really grown. “This is the perfect marriage between tissue engineering and regenerative medicine where tissue is grown in the lab and then, after implanting the decellularized tissue, the natural processes of the recipient's body makes it a living tissue again," Tranquillo said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although Tranquillo’s animal studies are promising, further studies and endeavors are necessary to determine if these artificial vessels can be used in humans. This exciting breakthrough highlights the possibility that vessels grown in labs can grow with the recipient. The benefits of this research are far-reaching, with the potential to eliminate the need for multiple surgeries in children and greatly relieve the health care system of high costs due to the need for periodic replacement of grafts. Most importantly, acellular conduits have the likely power to significantly improve the quality of life of children with congenital heart disease. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">By Madison Dufek, Biological Sciences with an emphasis in Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior, Minor in Communications, '17</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Author’s Note: </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">“Reproductive health care/family planning refers to services that provide birth control, prenatal care, and pregnancy termination procedures. This is a subset of health care that is in my opinion talked about too much but not enough – especially when it comes to abortion. I initially wrote this piece for an upper division writing class focusing on women’s health; but reproductive health care access soon transformed into a cause that is now a great passion of mine. The results from the literature had me fiercely enraged yet profoundly inspired. Women all over the world today are denied necessary health care because of skewed perceptions of family planning and women as a whole. Abortion services – be it via medication or surgical procedure – are vital to communities, not just women. What troubled me most was discovering that the women who are already struggling suffer the greatest from abortion restrictions – women who already have mouths to feed, who are working multiple jobs just to make ends meet, who are uninsured, and often have no support system at all. It saddens me to know that the needs of these women are so often disregarded as communities make judgements, and as lawmakers work to regulate women’s reproductive rights. Deciding to have an abortion can take a huge psychological and physical toll on women and their families; and abortion restrictions only make this experience more trying for them. This, however will not prevent women from seeking abortions, it will only cause more of them to suffer major health complications or even die trying to obtain an abortion. This piece is for anyone out there like me: someone who wants to get educated, who wants to join the conversation, and who wants to become a stronger advocate for women’s reproductive rights!”</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">Abstract</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This review of literature aims to assess the overall status of reproductive health care access nationwide. It investigates how statewide perceptions, stigmas, and policies affect access to this kind of health care, with an emphasis on abortion services. It was found that conservative states were positively correlated with having stricter reproductive health care restrictions. Three components: state legislation, perceptions, and stigmas have been shown to influence each other and shape regional access to reproductive health care. This paper investigates the unique experiences and struggles women face when seeking these services and are met with access restrictions. Women experienced significant economic and psychological stress as the level of abortion restrictions increased, which also affected their family planning decisions including if, when, and where they want to obtain contraceptives, prenatal care, or an abortion. Physicians also played a role in providing access to these services and influencing women’s health care decisions. With this knowledge, policy makers, physicians, and communities can better understand the world of reproductive health care and become better advocates for the improvement of access to these services on a national and even global scale. Additionally, this insight has the potential to influence the progression of women’s reproductive rights, which will in turn improve the health and well-being of women, their families, and communities alike.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Introduction</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Abortion access in the United States is a heavily debated issue and has kept the country politically and socially divided for decades. The question of how accessible abortion services are to women remains varied across state lines. Statewide perception, knowledge, and opinion regarding abortion have a great ability to affect statewide policies, how women access family planning services, and how they make their health care decisions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,3,10-12,15</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Restrictions such as gestational age limits, longer waiting periods, and an increased number of visits to abortion facilities have been shown to cause a major strain in the lives of women.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Women are forced to sacrifice more time, energy, and money to undergo this process, with low-income women bearing the hardest burden.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6,8</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The Guttmacher Institute, a leader in sexual and reproductive health research, reported an implementation of 334 abortion restrictions between 2011 and 2016 nationwide by states including Texas, Michigan, Missouri, and Alabama.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">12</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Seventeen of these states had also recently motioned to eliminate funding for abortions and family planning service providers like Planned Parenthood.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">12</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> These motions could have serious implications for women if enacted across the country. Women seeking abortions and are living in many of these communities that are misinformed and disregarded by lawmakers and health care professionals will not only find themselves struggling to find an abortion-providing facility, but will suffer greater health risks due to the lack of well-trained professionals. This review of literature works to reveal and understand the statewide societal perceptions surrounding abortion and how they influence public policy and social views regarding reproductive health. The unique experiences and struggles women face as a result of these views and policies are investigated to better understand the effects abortion restrictions have on women. In the wake of current upheaval regarding reproductive health care access, it is vital that this topic be discussed to further protect women’s rights.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Discussion</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Regional Influences on Family Planning: Perceptions, Stigma, and Policy</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Statewide perceptions and attitudes toward reproductive health care services such as abortion have been found to impact their level of accessibility to women. Factors including socioeconomic status and the amount of accurate abortion information provided to women show to have the largest effect.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4,5,8-13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Attitudes regarding abortion are not only present at the societal level, but also infiltrate state legislation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1,2,15 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, it is important that varying regional perceptions and stigmas be investigated to understand how they affect policy and women’s accessibility to reproductive health care services. </span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Perceptions and Stigma</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Current literature suggests that socially conservative states tend to have negative views on unplanned pregnancy, non-abstaining forms of birth control, and abortion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3,9,13,15</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> These states have also been found to provide less accurate abortion information to women than socially liberal states.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> These attitudes and lack of education regarding family planning can play a major role in the way women make important family planning decisions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">10,11,13,14</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Studies looking at the relationship between social ideologies and knowledge and perceptions of family planning have revealed some insightful results. Daniels et al. compared statewide accuracy of embryonic and fetal development information provided to women seeking abortions. They revealed that one-third of the information deemed inaccurate by specialists were congregated in Southern and Midwestern states - otherwise, typical conservative states.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> These results could explain findings from a 2016 study which assessed Texan women’s knowledge and support of abortion restrictions. A large proportion of women believed that abortion was morally wrong and were in support of restricted access.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">15</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Women with these views were more likely to be from socially conservative groups (conservative Republican or Catholic) compared to their more liberal Democrat or Protestant counterparts.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">15</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> However, over half the participants were either completely unaware or had little knowledge of current legislation on this topic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">15</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> According to Smith et al., social attitudes and widespread inaccurate reproductive health knowledge appears to have a major impact on the women seeking abortion services in other conservative states.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> A study conducted in Alabama revealed that although most women know there is a high abortion rate in the state, women who obtain abortions are highly judged by their communities, causing it to be a hushed or hidden occurrence.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Smith’s study is just one example of how negative perceptions regarding unplanned pregnancy and abortion can reinforce socially conservative views that are already unsupportive of reproductive health services. This cycle thus appears to be more prolific in socially conservative states, where more inaccurate reproductive health information is provided to communities, as observed in states like Alabama and Texas. These factors therefore play a major role in the public’s attitude regarding this issue, which can reflect voting patterns, policies, and the ways in which women make their health care choices. On the other hand, a study done by Aiken and Scott did not find a strong correlation between voting patterns of state legislators and stances on family planning.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> More research should be conducted to explain the relationship between voting habits and statewide perceptions of abortion.  </span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">How Perceptions Influence Policy</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Perceptions and stigma regarding abortion and unplanned pregnancy can impact both women’s health care decisions, and state policies on abortion access.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,5,6,13,14</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Although Bessett et al.’s study comparing attitudes and related state policies between conservative Republican “red states” and liberal Democrat “blue states” did not find a strong correlation between the two, the Guttmacher Institute’s most recent census on American reproductive health care access and related laws reported that 17 states, predominantly from the South and Midwest, passed 46 new abortion restrictions in 2016.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3,12</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> These restrictions required abortion providers to obtain unnecessary hospital admitting privileges, withhold funding to abortion-providing facilities, deny women insurance coverage, and enforce gestational age limits.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">12</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Counter regulations, however, have also been implemented to help increase access such as broadening women’s eligibility for insurance coverage, as well as supreme court overturns of major abortion restrictions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">12</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Therefore, although many states are working to further restrict abortion access, many others are working to increase accessibility and improve family planning for their female residents.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">12</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The Effects of Abortion Restrictions on Women</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Public knowledge and perception regarding abortion and family planning not only influence local policy, but also the experiences  and reproductive health care decisions of women seeking these services.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Kimball and Wissner’s assessment of state-level social determinants of health found that religiosity, social conservatism, and voting preferences were positively correlated with teen birth, abortion, and infant mortality rates, with the highest correlation being with social conservatism.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">9</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Secondary factors such as gestational age limits, financial cost, and harassment found by Jerman and Jones, which are more common in socially conservative states, cause psychological and economic stress for women seeking abortions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Between 2011 and 2012, women paid an average of $480 for abortion procedures, and found it more difficult to access facilities that would perform abortions as the gestational age increased. These same women also faced picketing and entry blockage at 84% of the abortion clinics visited nationwide. With these issues being more common in socially conservative areas, this could explain why Midwestern and Southern conservative states have the highest abortion rates but the fewest abortion-providing facilities.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6,7,13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> As a result, women seeking abortion procedures in these states are forced to travel much further, as well as struggle to find childcare, take time off work, face judgement, and even reduce food budgets for their families.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,6,8,11,13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> This may elucidate why many women either hesitate to have or completely forgo abortion procedures.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> These examples are typical situations for most women seeking abortions in conservative regions of the United States, with low-income women suffering the greatest strain.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thus, these social and economic restrictions prove to not only affect women’s well-being, but also the well-being of their families.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,8,9,11,13</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Conservative states (particularly Midwestern and Southern ones) are characterized as having several layers of abortion restrictions, which in turn negatively influence abortion rates and the well-being of women and their families living in these areas.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,6,8,9,11,13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> If restrictions continue to prove effective at limiting access to accurate information, specialized physicians, abortion facilities, and related affordable reproductive health care services, women will continue to either forgo the care they need or find much riskier solutions, which could result in major health complications.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>The Physician’s Role in Family Planning</b>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">A physician’s role in the family planning process is vital to women’s health and the future of their families. Although it is the duty of a physician to provide care regardless of personal beliefs or attitudes, many physicians either refuse to perform abortions even when qualified to do so, or fail to support the needs of their patients when discussing family planning options.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">10</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Therefore, assessing physicians’ abilities to provide accurate health care information and patient advocacy is an essential component to understanding abortion access nationwide. Although, physicians self-reported being able to overcome their personal opinions regarding abortions in a 2016 national study, female patients were seen as more worthy of empathy and abortion access by their physicians if they acted more feminine and expressed emotional remorse.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">10</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> In addition, physicians were more likely to delegitimize women’s needs for abortion and limit access if their patients elected to undergo the procedure rather than if they required one for a fetal anomaly, maternal health risk, or incest.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">10</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Margo et al.’s study of South Carolina revealed that many public health providers caring for women seeking abortion services imposed anti-abortion judgements on them, making many of these women doubt their original health care decisions and experience more self-judgement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">11</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> These studies reveal how influential the support and advice of physicians are to women making important family planning decisions. Physicians are seen as “gatekeepers” to essential reproductive health services for women; therefore, supporting their female patients’ wants and needs for these services is of crucial importance to improving women’s health and well-being.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">7,10,11,14</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Conclusion</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">There are many factors that influence women’s reproductive health care decisions. Statewide perceptions, stigmas, knowledge, and implementation of access policies can determine if a woman receives proper care. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">2-15</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Conservative states in the South and Midwest present the greatest reproductive health care access limitations in the country, and thus, reflect the largest proportion of poor health outcomes for these women.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2-4,6-8,11-13,15</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> This review, however is not able to fully reflect nationwide abortion access. With the literature showing a greater focus on conservative statewide family planning access, the experiences of women who seek these services in liberal states remains underlooked and cannot be objectively compared to women’s experiences in conservative states. The studies reviewed which assessed liberal state reproductive health care access showed to have major biases and lacked diverse samples of women.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> This is unfortunately a common limitation in abortion access studies, where only women who successfully underwent abortions are sampled.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2,5,6,11,13</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> With abortion access in liberal states typically being less restrictive compared to that of conservative states, it could explain why research in these areas is in short supply and might be more challenging to conduct. It is vital, however, that more data be collected in liberal states and from more diverse samples of women to adequately observe, assess, and improve reproductive health care access nationwide. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The various regional factors reported in the recent literature that influence women’s access to abortion services proved to be very insightful into the world of reproductive health care. These findings reveal several ways in which access to reproductive health care can be improved such as: (1) providing more accurate family planning information to communities, (2) making abortion-providing facilities more widely available, (3) supplementing these facilities with well-trained and empathetic physicians who perform affordable procedures, and (4) increasing insurance coverage for reproductive health care services overall. These are all excellent potential steps to not only improving reproductive health care, but the lives of women and their collective reproductive rights. </span>

<b>Author’s Note </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> This article is a synthesis of research that I have found about the genetic basis of nicotine addiction. The purpose of this piece is to thoroughly inform the reader. In this article I will discuss how genetic variation affects nicotine dependence, review studies which examine the effects of this genetic variation, and discuss how genetic variation can influence the likelihood of other diseases. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This article aims to follow an individual’s encounter with nicotine, starting with the first encounter of a cigarette to an examination of other diseases related to smoking. The sections below provide an explanation of the specific experiments which examined how nicotinic receptor genes  affect an individual’s response to nicotine.</span>

<!--more-->

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Nicotine acts as an addictive neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the development of smoking and tobacco dependence. However, many individuals have different responses to smoking, and not all are susceptible to developing an addiction. Therefore, there must be other factors that influence the development of tobacco addiction.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Mechanism of Nicotine</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Nicotine is a chemical that alters an individual’s mood, behavior, cognition, and body functions. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels found in neurons. When activated, the nAChRs undergo a conformational change that allows ions to pass through the channels and transmit an action potential throughout the neurons. Researchers found that nicotine causes increased levels of dopamine when the nAChRs are located on dopaminergic neurons [1]. Thus, the release of dopamine contributes to nicotine’s addictiveness.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Variation in Nicotinic Receptor Subunits </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">An individual’s physical response to nicotine depends on the types of subunits that make up the receptor. There are twelve genes that code for different subunits of nAChR, labeled </span><span style="font-weight: 400">α2–α10 and β2–β4.  The nAChR is composed of five subunits arranged in a ring around a channel </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[1]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The most abundant high-affinity nAChRs in the human brain are composed of two α4, two β4, and a fifth subunit that is variable [2]. This suggests that addiction can have a genetic basis. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Dizziness Caused by the First Cigarette Predicts Genetic Predisposition To Nicotine Addiction </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Every addiction begins with the first encounter with the drug, and nicotine addiction starting with smoking the first cigarette is no exception. Many first time tobacco smokers show a range of responses such as dizziness and nausea. Various phenotypic responses can be attributed to genetic variations in neuronal nicotinic receptor genes (CHRN). These genetic variations affect long term nicotine dependence. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Genetic variation can influence an individual’s initial response to a cigarette, which might  affect their perception and dependence on nicotine in the long term. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ehringer and his colleagues  discovered that the phenotypic response of dizziness was linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the CHRNB3 gene. Data from the experiments showed different levels of RNA expression resulting from SNPs in the CHRNB3 in smokers who reported dizziness after smoking their first cigarette. Notably, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">there was a strong correlation between dizziness and nicotine dependence. Individuals who had developed nicotine addiction reported a primarily negative physical response to the first cigarette [3]. Genetic variation is responsible for differences in physical responses to nicotine, which also affect the development of long term nicotine dependence. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The results of this study can be applied in clinical practice. Clinicians can use dizziness as an indication of an early smoking-related phenotype that is closely related to the underlying genetic mechanisms of tobacco addiction. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Youth and Nicotine Dependence </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Nicotine dependence is also affected by the initial age of the smoker. Smokers who start at an earlier age are more likely to develop a lifelong nicotine addiction. Therefore, youths and adolescents have the greatest vulnerability for developing nicotine dependence. Specific genetic markers that are associated with a smoking phenotype, such as cigarettes smoked per day, can be a quantitative measure of nicotine dependence. In a longitudinal study led by Cannon, researchers identified the relationship between genetic variants and the smoking phenotype of cigarettes per day (CPD) in European smokers</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> between ages 15 and 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. SNPs in several CHRN regions in young smokers (CHRNB3A6 SNP </span><span style="font-weight: 400">rs2304297</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">CHRNA5A3B4 haplotype C, CHRNA2 SNP rs2271920) were found </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[4].</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Each SNP independently contributed to an increase in cigarettes per day. These genetic markers are associated with increased smoking behavior in youth, supporting the claim that genetic variants can influence nicotine dependence.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Risk-taking Genes Might Explain Risk Taking Behavior in Youth</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Risky behavior varies among different populations due to genetic variation. Some individuals are more likely to start drinking or smoking because they have certain risk-taking alleles that contribute to their behavior. In a study of different ethnic populations, researchers found </span><span style="font-weight: 400">significant differences in the allele frequency of SNP markers between Caucasians, Hispanics, and African Americans. Researchers found three SNPs in the CHRNA5, A3, and B4 (A5A3B4) gene cluster that are associated with an earlier age of initiation of both alcohol and tobacco consumption. Researchers concluded that variation in these genes might influence behaviors that promote early age experimentation with drugs and other risks. Considering how the A5A3B4 gene cluster influences nicotine dependence and alcohol consumption, it is very likely that these genes are involved in the development of risk-taking behavior. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Individuals with these alleles tend to experiment with harmful substances since they perceive nicotine and alcohol as a low risk [5]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Genetic variation contributes to both behavior and risk perceptions. Consequently, genetics has a strong influence on nicotine dependence. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Genetic Variation in Nicotine Dependence</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Individuals have varied response to nicotine; some people become addicted after smoking just one cigarette, while others will never become addicted even after smoking one hundred cigarettes. To observe how genetic variation can affect smoking behavior, researchers must study a quantifiable phenotype that indicates nicotine dependence. Thus, in order to identify genes that influence nicotine dependencies, they must study a highly heritable and quantifiable phenotype such as the number of cigarettes per day (CPD). Individuals who have a higher CPD are at a greater risk of developing  long term nicotine dependence. In a genome wide study of three European populations, Berrettini et al examined if there were certain SNPs associated with an increase in CPD. The results found certain SNPs in the CHRNA5 within individuals who smoke more cigarettes per day [6]. Thus these SNPs were linked to an increase smoking behavior and higher risk of developing an addiction to nicotine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Additional evidence suggests a strong genetic association with nicotine dependence. A recent study by Saccone found that a non-synonymous SNP in CHRNA5, in the genes of nicotine dependent individuals, increased the risk of nicotine dependence </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[7].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">A non-synonymous SNP is an SNP in a protein-coding region that results in a change in an amino acid, thus changing the overall protein structure. Researchers found the SNP caused an amino acid located at 398 to change from the normal allele containing asparagine to the risk allele with aspartic acid. This SNP had an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, meaning that individuals would have to inherit two mutated risk alleles in order to be nicotine dependent. Individuals who were homozygous for the risk allele experienced a two-fold increase in the risk of developing nicotine dependence [7]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This supports  the hypothesis that nicotine dependence has a genetic basis. Uncovering genetic factors that affect nicotine dependence will provide doctors with more knowledge to prevent, diagnose, and treat nicotine addiction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Genetic variation contributes to both increases and decreases in nicotine dependence. In a study by  Feng, researchers found an association between the CHRNA4 rs1044396 SNP and an increased nicotine dependence in Chinese males. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">A genetic variant of CHRNA4 causes the C nucleotide to become a T nucleotide. The C allele increases the risk  of nicotine addiction while the T protects against nicotine addiction. The researchers found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400">individuals with the C allele smoked more cigarettes and also had a greater dependence on nicotine. Interestingly, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">CHRNA4 rs1044396 polymorphism is a synonymous polymorphism, insofar as  there is no change to the protein sequence [8]. This polymorphism must be further studied in order to understand its mechanisms with other CHRN genes. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Smoking Related Diseases</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to nicotine dependence, genetic variation can influence the likelihood of contracting other nicotine-related diseases. Thorgeirsson et al discovered a genetic association between an SNP in the CHRNA3 gene and an increase in smoking quantity, nicotine dependence, and the risk of smoking related diseases, such as lung cancer and peripheral arterial disease in patients of European descent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">They also found this genetic variant in 18% of lung cancer samples and 10% of peripheral arterial disease samples, which supports the conclusion that the SNP increased the chances of contracting both nicotine-related diseases [9].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Genetic variation influences nicotine dependence and can increase one’s susceptibility to developing smoking related diseases. Thus, smoking can have a variable impact on health. The variable phenotypes of nicotine dependence can be attributed to genetic variation. In addition, general precaution against nicotine use and abuse is necessary because individuals are usually unaware of their genetic susceptibilities. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>The Genetic Risks of Lung Cancer</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Longer term nicotine abuse generally leads to fatal diseases such as lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Therefore, it is imperative to determine genetic factors that contribute to disease risk in order to understand the mechanism of the disease. In </span><span style="font-weight: 400">a genome-wide association study by Hung and others, researchers identified the genetic factors that increase the risk of lung cancer</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In the study, they focused on the A5A3B4 gene cluster region since it is known for its role in nicotine dependence. Researchers determined  a locus in the chromosome region 15q25 that is strongly associated with lung cancer </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[10]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. This genetic marker contains six genes that encode the nAChR subunits, an iron sense response element, a gene used in DNA repair, and a gene that has a currently unknown function. The names of these genes are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CHRNA5</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CHRNA3</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CHRNB4</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">IREB2</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">PSMA4</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, and LOC123688</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [10]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The strongest evidence also indicated that the SNP in the CHRNA5 gene developed a non-synonymous variant that increased the risk of lung cancer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Researchers concluded that these genetic variants influence an individual’s risk and predisposition to lung cancer. Long term nicotine abuse, in the form of smoking, might increase one’s chances of developing lung cancer in individuals who are genetically predisposed. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Neuropsychiatric Disorders Related to CHRNA SNPs</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to lung cancer risk, genetic variation in  acetylcholine receptor genes also affects cognition. These effects increase the risk of developing other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and addiction. Researchers in a study led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Mobascher</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> analyzed the genotypes of German individuals and compared the results to a cognitive processing test. As a part of the cognitive test, researchers used an electroencephalogram to record the individual’s response to an auditory stimulus. The study found five SNPs within the CHRNA4 region that affected both the auditory system and cognitive processes [11]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Researchers then examined the mean reaction time for three rs1044396 genotype groups (TT, CT, and CC). Although there was no statistical pattern in reaction time, there was a genotype sex interaction effect on reaction time. In females, the TT genotype was associated with a slower reaction time, while in males with TT had a faster reaction time. The results of this study found an SNP, specifically the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CHRNA4</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> rs1044396 T-allele, that is associated with a decrease in attentiveness </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[11]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In future studies, this allele can be used as a marker for risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and attention deficit disorders.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Visuospatial Attention </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A cognitive phenotype is defined as a distinct behavioral or cognitive characteristic that can be quantitatively measured. Cognitive phenotypes are used in neurobiology to diagnose and classify neuropsychiatric illness [12]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In a study by Greenwood and co-authors, researchers examined the cognitive phenotype of visuospatial attention  produced by a SNP in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CHRNA4</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> gene. Components of the visuospatial attention depend on large scale neurocognitive networks that are moderated by the nAChRs [13]. Visuospatial attention strongly influences how quickly and accurately the brain evaluates and processes events. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Researchers also studied how nicotinic stimulation affects the brain’s networking. A genetic variant of CHRNA4 causes the C nucleotide to become a T nucleotide. Researchers found that the C allele is associated with an increased risk of nicotine addiction, while the T allele is protective against developing a nicotine addiction[8]. Supposedly, an individual with two TT alleles for the CHRNA4 gene will have an increased number of low affinity nicotine receptors which is less likely to activate a response in the neuron. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">By administering nicotine to non-smokers and measuring behavioral and brain activities via imaging, they found that nicotine causes a narrow focus of attention by binding to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Researchers found an association between attention and the nicotinic cholinergic system. They hypothesized that the T allele of CHRNA4 rs1044396 SNP is associated with the ability of focusing attention on a target inside a region at the expense of events outside the region. Individuals who are CHRNA T/T homozygous may take longer both to redirect their attention and to change their perspective of an event based on new information [13].  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Depression and Loneliness in Elderly Males</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Genetic variants in acetylcholine receptors play a role in smoking behavior, cognitive function, and negative emotion. Since nAChRs are a type of receptors located in the brain and play a role in dopamine regulation, they can also play a role in the development of depression. A recent study found that a genetic variation in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CHRNA4 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">(rs1044396) had an effect on attention and negative emotion in normal adults </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[14]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In this study, led by Tsai, researchers established a genotype-phenotype correlation between genetic variation in CHRNA4 (rs1044396) and cognitive function/depressed moods </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[14]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Researchers evaluated the level of loneliness, diagnosed potential depression, and assessed cognitive functions in elderly (63-98 years old) male smokers living in Veteran’s Home in northern Taiwan in comparison to their genotype </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[14]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In the study, the sample of elderly Chinese males with the CHRNA4 rs1044396 SNP and a C/C genotype had higher levels of depression and loneliness than the T allele carriers [14]. A possible explanation for the correlation between depression and nicotine dependence is that increased feelings of depression </span><span style="font-weight: 400">or loneliness </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in C/C homozygotes can lead to an increase in use of nicotine as a self-medicating substance to relieve negative emotions. These results indicate that nAChR genetic variants have an effect on the mechanism of depression.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The results of these experiments support the idea that genetic variation heavily contributes to an individual’s development of nicotine addiction. Minute molecular changes such as SNPs can have significant impacts on one’s health. An individual’s physical response to nicotine can vary depending on genetic variation in nicotine receptors. Surprisingly, Ehringer et al found that individuals who had developed nicotine addiction later in life reported an initial negative response of dizziness after smoking the first cigarette [3]. Genetic variation can play a role in initiating risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco consumption in youths. A study found that individuals with certain SNPs in the CHRNA5, A3, and B4 gene-cluster perceived nicotine and alcohol substances as low risks and therefore were more likely to participate in risky behavior [5]. Additionally, researchers identified that a single SNP in a protein-coding region of the CHRNA5 gene can result in a two-fold increase in the risk of developing nicotine dependence [7]. Nicotine addiction can lead to other smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer and peripheral arterial diseases. Therefore, genetic variation can also contribute to an individual's risk of contracting such diseases. General precaution against nicotine use and abuse is necessary since individuals are usually unaware of their genetic susceptibilities. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">by Bukre Coskun, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Cell Biology ‘18</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Author’s Note: I became interested in the immune system and the role of the thymus after taking an immunology class where I learned about how T-cells are distributed throughout our body. I wanted to explore this subject more after learning that the thymus, an organ that is integral to the production of T-cells, atrophies after puberty and eventually becomes inactive.  Here, I review a publication that describes how the concentration of T-cells in our body changes as we age. </span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">The thymus plays a key role in the production and maturation of T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that identifies and kills cancer cells, virus-infected cells, or cells that are damaged in other ways. Hormones released by the thymus, such as thymosin, stimulate the maturation of T-cells before they are expelled into the bloodstream. Some T-cells migrate to lymph nodes where they become activated </span><span style="font-weight: 400">when they are presented with antigens by MHC class II molecules by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Active T-cells then divide and help identify and kill pathogens, activate B cells to produce antibodies, and build an army of memory T-cells to respond quickly to secondary exposure to the infection. While most organs grow with us as we age, the thymus slowly shrinks after puberty and is replaced with fatty tissue. Therefore, aging is associated with the deterioration of the thymus that leads to the decreased production of new T-lymphocytes and thus, decreased immune function. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Thome et al. from Columbia University recently published a paper in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Science Immunology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> describing how compartmentalization of T-cells in lymph nodes allows for naive T-cells to be maintained throughout the human lifespan. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> While most immunological studies rely on blood samples to identify circulating T-cells, which contain only 3% of the total T-cells in the body, Thome et al. used human tissue to analyze cell composition. While some T-cells are found in circulating blood, they are mostly found in lymphoid tissues located at various submucosal membranes throughout our body, such as those associated with our lungs and eyes. Analyzing human tissue allowed scientists to characterize the other 97% of total T-cells in the body, uncovering more information about T-cell lineage and sustenance. Human tissues were obtained from organ donors through the organization LiveOnNY, and from discarded tissue from patients undergoing pediatric cardiac surgery through the Human Studies Core of the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology. Lymphocytes were then isolated from the various lymphoid tissues obtained, including the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To identify how the production of T-cells changes over time, researchers studied the presence of T-cells in tissue samples from a large range of ages. In order to measure thymic output of T-cells, researchers marked the differences between immature T-cells, cells that had recently exited the thymus, and long-lived naive cells in the periphery. The team identified new naïve T-cells by looking for episomal circular DNA (TRECs) formed during recombination of a gene in the T-cell receptor. TRECs are stable and not duplicated during mitosis, so they diminish with each cellular division. By determining </span><span style="font-weight: 400">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">REC content using a PCR-based approach</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">the researchers determined that different sites had concentrations of naive T-cells that varied based on the age of the donor. For instance, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">pediatric patients had more T cells in the thymus, while older children had more T cells in the lung-draining lymph node</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, there was a decline in the thymic production of naïve T-cells after the age of 40. This supports the age-related regression of the thymus and the correlated decrease in naive T-cell output. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This finding suggests that naive T-cells are selective about where in the body they travel to as we age, although the mechanism for this is unclear. More interestingly, the study found that naïve cells are not as mobile as previously thought. Instead, they travel only to specific sites where they nest and receive signals to expand in the vicinity of these “nests”. Thus, T-cells observed to be circulating in high numbers during childhood are naive T-cells in transit to their lymphoid homes rather than naive T-cells migrating between tissues.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding how T-cells differentiate and populate different tissue sites, such as lymph nodes, after leaving the thymus may allow us to personalize immunotherapies and vaccines. Furthermore, studying how aging correlates with the shrinkage of the thymus and the reduction in T-cell diversity may help us address increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, infection, and cancer in older individuals. In fact, it may even be possible to preserve T-cell functionality by slowing, stopping or reversing thymic recession. Continued research on the mechanisms and spatiality of our immune system will help advance new approaches for extending immune competency in older individuals. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Author’s Note: “This is a reflective case study I wrote for UWP104F (Writing in the Health Profession) about a patient’s illness experience with chronic pain. After conducting an interview with the patient, I became intrigued by the controversial aspects of her ailment, and drew on research to better understand the scientific context of chronic pain. I hope that my reflection at the end raises questions that readers are also thinking, and that these questions could spur readers to learn more about the subject.” </span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">Pain is frequently characterized as a visible symptom— a purple bruise, the “ouch” exclaimed after bumping into a table corner. We may wince simply at the sight of pain, and observing pain in action makes most of us feel empathy for its victims. Consequently, pain rarely brings to mind something invisible. But pain can go undetected by the naked eye, as exemplified by chronic pain, which is widely regarded as an invisible ailment. Patients not only battle persistent pain that lasts months to years but also cope with no visible signs of injury.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When I first learned about the subject of this reflective case study, a female student at the University of California, Davis, I was intrigued by the invisible aspect of her chronic pain condition. I decided to conduct an interview with the patient and discovered other engaging aspects of her experience. Prior to developing chronic pain, the patient described herself as a “normal college student” who strived to keep different areas of her life in balance [1]. Although she spent hours on schoolwork each day, she always made time for her hobbies and social life. Her daily routine also consisted of exercising regularly and getting enough sleep nightly.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">This routine changed when the patient began her sophomore year in college with a heavy course workload. Feeling immense pressure to do well, the patient spent extra time to manage her studies, which often meant late nights and putting schoolwork as her sole focus. One night, she had just finished studying when she felt a dull ache spread across her shoulders. She assumed it was her stiff posture that caused the problem and didn’t think much of it, dismissing the pain easily. Her shoulders had never been injured before so she didn’t see reason to be alarmed; but the shoulder pain persisted, for weeks and then months. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When asked why she didn’t seek medical attention right away or try to alleviate her pain, the patient replied that she didn’t consider her shoulder pain to be a “serious problem” [1]. While the lack of visible injury contributed to this belief, the patient also deemed her age to be a factor. She did not think it was plausible for her nineteen-year-old self to develop a severe pain condition that is commonly associated with older adults, particularly in television commercials for pain relief medication.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The patient’s misconceptions about chronic pain are typical and have similarly caused other chronic pain patients to delay treatment and professional help. While chronic pain can develop after a major injury or illness, such as a back injury or shingles, it can also arise without a known cause [2]. Pain is the body's way of alerting a person that something is wrong, and it is normal for the body to send pain signals to the brain when someone is injured or ill. However, pain that lingers after an injury or illness is abnormal. Chronic pain is defined as pain that extends longer than three months, and could even persist for years [2]. Anyone can develop chronic pain but it is more common in older adults [2]. It is not a normal part of aging. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although the patient experienced chronic shoulder pain in the absence of a past injury, she believes her stress levels during sophomore year contributed significantly to her condition. The patient could manage her classes by adhering to a rigorous studying routine but her efforts took a toll on her health. It is not yet fully clear to researchers how stress and pain are related; however, evidence shows that stress and pain can influence each other dramatically [3]. Stress not only has an emotional impact on a person but can cause physical pain as well. Furthermore, studies support the conclusion that emotional processes in the brain can increase pain [4]. The brain is a key player in determining how people perceive pain because the nervous system regulates pain and its pathways [5]. The brain always tries to inhibit pain signals; however, if a person is stressed, the brain’s ability to filter these signals is hindered [5]. Consequently, the sensation of pain can actually be increased due to stress [5].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The patient suffered a year of shoulder pain before deciding to visit her physician. She realized her condition was serious when the pain became too difficult to ignore and endure; the bursts of pain gradually became more frequent, spreading to her neck during certain occurrences. Even sitting down for a short period would cause an ache to emerge in her shoulders. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">After conducting library research, I determined that the patient’s condition can be classified as nociceptive pain, one of two generally accepted categories of chronic pain that is characterized by a dull ache [6]. Nociceptive pain “arises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue” and is caused by the activation of nociceptors [6]. It’s possible that the patient’s stress posed a threat to tissue damage, thereby triggering the nociceptors. Nociceptors are sensory receptors that detect signals from damaged tissue or threat of damage in the body [7]. These sensors of the pain pathway are located in the skin, as well as in other structures such as blood vessels and tendons [8]. Tissue damage and the threat of damage trigger the activation of nociceptors, and the pain signals travel from the nociceptors, through the sensory nerves, and up the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain, which works to relay sensory signals in the brain [8]. The pain signal is then sent to the cerebral cortex, which is the part of the brain that processes thought [8]. Nociceptors play an integral role in sounding the pain alarm in the body, in response to highly specific stimulation. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">When the patient finally visited the doctor’s office, her physician prescribed two pain relievers-- ibuprofen and acetaminophen--and provided little guidance for long-term treatment. Without a formal diagnosis from her physician, the patient came to her own conclusion that her shoulder pain was associated with stress. The patient explained that she feels the impact of her shoulder pain most aggressively before studying for exams because she is stressed out about doing well. The dull pain hits her shoulders in frequent bursts and she temporarily relieves the pain with Bengay, a type of analgesic cream used to alleviate muscle aches. She clarified that she decided not to take ibuprofen after a while because she “didn’t like taking pills all the time” [1]. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">After forming her own conclusion, the patient reigned in her unhealthy study habits, which  subsequently decreased her stress levels. She now possesses coping methods and outlets for her stress.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“I manage my stress by hanging out with friends, going to the gym to exercise, taking study breaks, and studying early for exams. I don’t stay up late anymore. I don’t think my body can handle it,” the patient explained [1]. Although she still experiences chronic shoulder pain, the frequency of pain outbursts have decreased, and the pain is now localized to her left shoulder rather than spread across both shoulders. She hopes that with time, her shoulder pain could be managed to the point that she will no longer require any treatment.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The patient’s experience with chronic pain raises the importance of acknowledging the invisible aspect of certain illnesses. Although she did not show any visible signs of injury, the patient still suffered pain that was real and required attention. It is interesting that what is invisible to a third party observer could be invisible to the patient as well, and patients could be just as likely to believe that their condition is not serious because they do not visibly observe that something is wrong. The patient’s initial dismissal of her condition due to preconceived ideas about chronic shoulder pain brings up the problem of harmful misconceptions in medicine. These misconceptions about certain illnesses merit attention because they have been shown to be potentially damaging to patients, and could delay timely diagnosis and treatment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The relationship between stress and chronic pain in the patient’s experience demonstrates how a negative emotion like stress could manifest itself physically in the body and cause harm. It is notable that for the patient, coping with stress and learning how to manage her stress levels alleviated her chronic pain without medicinal treatment. Could self-treatment yield just as successful results in other chronic pain patients, given that pain is a very personal and subjective experience? Most certainly, the patient’s case speaks to the important relationship between the mind and the body. Because the patient managed her emotional health and actively sought to reduce her stress, her body was able to heal as well.</span>

<b>Author’s note</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I originally wrote this paper for my Biological Systems class, the instructor of which was interested in researching the physiological role of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1). He instructed his students to write an essay exploring this role in any way they wanted, and I chose to focus on the link between MCT1 and cancer. I enjoyed sifting through multiple strands of evidence for the reasons behind this link — strands that oftentimes were not in agreement with one another.</span>

<!--more-->

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), as their name implies, are proteins that transport molecules with just one carboxylate group — such as lactate and pyruvate — across the cell membrane (1). This transport is proton-linked in that the concentration gradients of protons and monocarboxylates determine the direction of net transport (1). There exist several different MCT isoforms, each with different biochemical properties and functions (2). For instance, isoforms 1-4 play key roles in energy metabolism in the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, in addition to T-lymphocyte activation and bowel metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (2). MCT8, on the other hand, aids in thyroid hormone transport across the blood-brain barrier, while MCT10 facilitates the transport of aromatic amino acids (2). Notably, MCT1 in particular has been linked to cancer progression, and several mechanisms through which it does so have been proposed over the years (11-22). MCT1’s role as a pH regulator, lactate and pyruvate transporter, and growth and transcription factor activator may contribute to its ability to bolster cancer cell activity (11-22).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span>

<b>pH Regulator</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Solid tumor cells in hypoxic microenvironments rely upon anaerobic glycolysis to synthesize ATP (3). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike normal cells, however, cancer cells have been observed to perform the metabolically inefficient aerobic glycolysis in the presence of oxygen </span><span style="font-weight: 400">(4). This phenomenon was coined the Warburg effect after Otto Warburg, who first reported it in the 1920s, and it has confounded scientists ever since (5). In the presence of oxygen, most cells rely upon mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in order to synthesize enough ATP to sustain themselves, as this pathway can produce up to 36 ATP molecules per glucose (6, 7). In glycolysis, by contrast, each glucose yields only two ATP molecules (7). This fact makes the Warburg effect seem paradoxical, as the rapid proliferation of cancer cells would indicate that they have high energy demands (4). Multiple explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon; whatever the reasons behind it, though, it is key that tumor cells exhibit a high glycolytic rate with or without oxygen present (7).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400"> In this context, MCT1’s relationship to increased cancer cell development and progression can be explored. The high glycolytic rate of cancer cells leads to the production of hydrogen ions and lactic acid among other things, the consequence being decreased local pH (8). Acidification of the intracellular environment has been linked to cellular apoptosis, as well as the activation of endonucleases that induce DNA fragmentation (9). Extracellularly, increased acidity has the opposite effect: it aids in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells (9). As such, mechanisms to maintain the pH of cancer cells are necessary for their survival and success. Where MCT1 comes in thus becomes apparent given the importance of pH regulation in cancer cells: by shuttling lactate and protons, which are tied to cellular pH, MCT1 confers these cells with the ability to survive and even thrive in acidic environments (10). One way in which MCT1 provides an advantage to tumor cells is through pH regulation, an ability that goes hand in hand with its co-transport of protons.</span>

<b>Lactate transporter</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond its maintenance of pH, MCT1’s transport of lactate in particular contributes to its correlation with increased cancer cell activity. As aforementioned, the increased glycolytic rate of cancer cells results in high lactate levels (7). In order for continuous glycolysis to occur, therefore, the transport of this lactate is essential (11). In this context, the association between MCT1’s role as a lactate transporter and its utility for cancer cells is clear (11). This association has been explored by Payen and colleagues, who found that lactate release decreased and intracellular lactate accumulation increased both when MCT1 was silenced and when it was deleted in cancer cells (12). Significantly, the glycolytic efficiency of the cells decreased when MCT1 expression was inhibited (12). Lactate itself has also been linked to tumors: not only is its abundance an indicator of metastases and cancer patient survival, but it also has been shown to facilitate cell migration and cluster formation (13). In other words, lactate level both reflects and increases cancer cell malignancy (14). The association between lactate abundance and tumor potency again points to the importance of MCT1’s ability to transport lactate.</span>

<b>Pyruvate transporter</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to lactate, MCT1 transports pyruvate, and this aspect of it offers an alternative explanation for</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> its boosting of cancer cell activity</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In one study, Sun Hong and colleagues found that inhibiting MCT1 reduced pyruvate rather than lactate export in breast cancer cells (15). This study implies that MCT1’s role as a pyruvate transporter lies at the heart of its contribution to tumor growth (15). Sun Hong et al. began by examining gene expression to confirm the correlation between MCT1 and the glycolytic phenotype in breast cancer cells; thereafter they analyzed normal and malignant breast and lung tissues, ultimately determining that MCT1 protein levels were elevated in the malignant tissues (15). Following these initial findings, in order to investigate MCT1’s effect on metabolic phenotype, they generated breast cancer cell lines in which MCT1 expression was knocked down (15). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The results suggested that MCT1’s mediation of pyruvate export is a key function for it in glycolytic breast cancer cells — and that its mediation of lactate export is not </span><span style="font-weight: 400">(15). Whether the same phenomenon holds true for other cancer types such as colon, lung, or prostate cancer has yet to be investigated (15). It should also be noted that the cancer cells used in this study expressed higher levels of another isoform, MCT4, than those in other studies (15). This fact may explain discrepancies between these studies regarding the mechanism by which MCT1 aids cancer cells.</span>

<b>Growth factor activator</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Still other researchers have found evidence that MCT1 confers advantages to cancer cells independently of its transporter activity. Gray et al., for instance, found an association between MCT1 expression and growth factor-induced tumor cell motility (16). In one study, Gray and colleagues knocked down MCT1 expression and subsequently observed a change in two signaling pathways, called the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor pathways, both of which are important for the movement of tumor cells (16). Inhibiting MCT1, the researchers found, decreased the activity of both EGF and HGF as measured by the effects on tumor cell scattering and wound healing (16). Notably, the knockdown of MCT1 expression did not affect the net transport of lactic acid, likely due to redundancy between MCT1 and MCT4 (16). These results indicate it was MCT1’s relationship with the aforementioned growth factors that was responsible for the change in cell motility, a relationship independent of its activity as a transporter (16).</span>

<b>Transcription factor activator</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Further studies have indicated yet another function for MCT1 in cancer cell metastasis beyond transport. These studies concern the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) pathway, which has been shown to play a crucial role in cancer development and progression (17). Through western blotting analysis, Zhao and colleagues demonstrated in one study that several human osteosarcoma cell lines express MCT1</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">(18). Thereafter they knocked down MCT1 expression in such cell lines and observed a suppression in cell growth both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in vitro </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in vivo </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">following this knockdown (18). Moreover, they found that inhibition of MCT1 decreased other metastatic activities such as wound healing, invasion, and migration in osteosarcoma (18). In this study, Zhao et al. focused on NF-κB signaling to explain their findings, as its hyperactivation has been linked to the enhancement of tumor cell survival and metastasis (18). By either downregulating MCT1 with the specific inhibitor α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate or suppressing it through RNA interference, they found they could decrease the activity of the NF-κB pathway, which in turn impaired the function of the osteosarcoma cells (18). MCT1’s ties to NF-κB thus play a part in its facilitation of cancer cell activity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Based upon the work of Zhao and others, Payen and colleagues further explored the connection between the NF-κB pathway and MCT1’s function with regard to tumor cells (12). They found that dosing carcinoma cells with the MCT1 inhibitors AR-C155858 or AZD3965 did not impair either cell migration or invasion; importantly, they noted that these inhibitors did not affect MCT1 expression in the cells (12). From this latter point, Payen and colleagues hypothesized that MCT1 expression is in fact responsible for controlling cancer cell migration — and that its activity as a transporter is not (12). They subsequently generated a transport-inactive version of MCT1 and expressed it in cells in which they had deleted the active version of MCT1 (12). What they found upon doing so was that migration was restored in these cells, implying that MCT1’s promotion of cancer cell migration is indeed independent of its transporter activity (12). Following these results, they activated NF-κB in MCT1-deficient cells and found that cell migration ability was then rescued; when they treated these cells with a highly specific NF-κB inhibitor, the opposite effect was observed (12). All in all, these experiments indicate that MCT1 controls cancer cell migration through its connection to NF-κB.</span>

<b>Association with CD147</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">One final explanation for MCT1’s promotion of cancer cell activity is its relationship with the chaperone protein CD147. CD147 expression, which is elevated in carcinomas, is positively correlated with tumor recurrence and progression and negatively correlated with cancer patient survival (19). Because CD147 is essential for the transport of MCT1 to the plasma membrane, inhibiting CD147 expression disrupts the function of MCT1 — and, some have proposed, cancer cell activity as a result (10, 20). Others have suggested that the stable complexes that MCT1 and CD147 form with one another are a more significant factor in MCT1’s promotion of tumor cell progression (12). As CD147 has been found to activate NF-κB in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, some researchers have posited that these MCT1-CD147 complexes boost cancer cell activity through CD147-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway (12). Overall, MCT1’s association with CD147 may add to its facilitation of tumor progression.</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">MCT1’s ability to transport lactate and pyruvate, in addition to activate growth and transcription factors, may play a key part in the aid it provides to cancer cells. Further studies of the correlation between MCT1 and tumor progression may provide insight into the ways in which it can be used in a chemotherapeutic fashion. Already several attempts have been made to assess the effects of various MCT1 inhibitors on cancer cell metabolism (21). The case of AZD3965, a selective MCT1 inhibitor, illustrates the necessity of further research into MCT1’s facilitation of tumor development and progression. One study demonstrated that inhibiting MCT1 with AZD3965 activates glycolysis, resulting in intracellular lactate accumulation (22). But another study showed that AZD3965 does not affect glycolytic activity or lactate levels in cancer cells; instead, it appeared only to inhibit tumors through the disruption of pyruvate export (15). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that more work must be done in order to understand the metabolic changes induced by this inhibitor and any others, work that will be crucial in assessing their potential as chemotherapeutic drugs. The part MCT plays in cancer maintenance and progression also appears to vary depending on the type of cancer; conflicting results and lack of functional studies warrant additional investigation into the matter (10). In the future, more progress may be made with respect to targeting MCT1 as a means to halt tumor progression — and grasping MCT1’s exact role in this progression is the first step toward such progress.</span>

<b><i>Author’s Note:</i></b><b><i>
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">I am interested in studying dentistry in future graduate studies, and have always wanted to learn more about the topics it has to offer. After taking a class focusing on neurons, it made me curious as to how the sensory abilities of teeth play out. I was surprised to read online a specific type of cell is involved with tooth sensitivity, and delved into research articles from there. I also wanted to highlight the future implications these studies help shed light on, such that future research will help clarify our understanding on topics like this.</span>

<!--more-->

<b><i>
</i></b><b><i>Introduction</i></b><b><i>
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Odontoblasts are cells found within sites of tooth development during the entire human lifespan. Their counterpart, odontoclasts, are involved in absorption of deciduous teeth during normal development (Dixon </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2000). <img class="alignright" src="https://snag.gy/EKQcJy.jpg" />The primary function of odontoblasts is dentinogenesis, although an important secondary role involved in sensation is highly implicated. This is supported by Brännström’s hydrodynamic theory of tooth sensitivity, the leading theory on how odontoblasts are involved in sensory perception (Black </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. 2014). The theory suggests a signal transduction process, where changes in dentinal fluid from the external environment can stimulate the odontoblasts near the pulpal end of the dentinal tubule, leading their afferent myelinated A fibers to send sensory signals through the trigeminal nerve to the brain (Brännström 1966). More recent studies have examined the specific molecules and channels involved behind the odontoblast and its initiation of action potentials (Ikeda </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2017).</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">These studies, which will be examined as follows, have clarified roles of the molecules involved with odontoblasts. Many of these studies support Brännström’s hydrodynamic theory and highlight the advantages of further research.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><b><i>Tooth Anatomy</i></b><b><i>
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">     Each of a human’s regular thirty-two teeth are anatomically divided into two main parts – the root, which consists of the lower part of the tooth surrounded by bone, and the crown, which is superior to the root and surrounded by gums. A layer of enamel covers the anatomical crown of the tooth, while cementum covers the anatomical root of the tooth. Underneath the enamel and cementum is dentin, a calcified tissue that surrounds the inner center pulp, as shown in Figure 1.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">     It has been well-documented that a major role of odontoblasts is dentinogenesis, the formation of dentin (Bleicher 2014). Specifically, oligopotent neural crest stem cells give rise to odontoblasts.<img class="alignleft" src="https://i.snag.gy/WmBRcE.jpg" />After the odontoblasts mature, their cell bodies remain in the pulp’s outer wall, forming a boundary between the dentin and pulp, as shown in Figure 2. Located within the dentin are dentinal tubules, which extend from the outer pulp wall to the border of cementum or enamel. Due to the microscopic nature of these structures, their exact functions have remained unclear in past studies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><b><i>Mechano-sensory Secondary Role</i></b><b><i>
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">     It is now known that unmyelinated C sensory nerve fibers surround odontoblasts’ cell bodies while myelinated A fibers surround their processes, and that odontoblasts’ processes enter dentinal tubules (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009). This unique position allows for odontoblasts to not only sense external stimuli, but also transient changes inside the pulp. Dentinal fluid inside the dentinal tubules allows for detection of movement. Although it has been difficult to properly examine, previous research indicates dentinal fluid has an elevated concentration of potassium compared to control serum (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">     The association of nerves with odontoblasts has since been highly documented. Trigeminal nerve fibers form the sensory axonal network around odontoblasts (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009). Primary cilium, an organelle involved in sensory transduction, has been regularly identified throughout human odontoblasts, although the specific mechanistic roles are still being researched (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009). One hypothesis suggests that odontoblasts’ cilia in the cell bodies sense pulp microenvironment (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009). Taken together, these data support the secondary role odontoblasts have as mechano-sensory receptors through axonal signal transduction pathways.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><b><i>Cell Membrane Channels and Signal Transduction</i></b><b><i>
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">     Voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and chloride-selective channels have been documented in the odontoblast membrane, suggesting a possible role in action potentials in odontoblasts. In addition to the typical cell membrane channels, K</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ca </span><span style="font-weight: 400">and TREK-1 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400">two major mechano-sensitive ion channels </span><span style="font-weight: 400">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400">have been highlighted in odontoblasts (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009).  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">     Calcium-activated potassium channels in odontoblasts have been suggested to play a role in mechano-sensitivity detection when the channels activated in response to membrane stretch, revealing a potential mechanism for transducing mechanical stimulus into electrical signals (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009). While the exact mechanism behind the signal transduction has not been uncovered, one theory suggests that an increase of intracellular calcium due to mechanical stretch on the tooth could open odontoblasts’ K</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ca</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> channels and cause depolarization at their nerve endings (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009). This theory is supported by a previous study that induced tooth pain sensation after inserting potassium agents into dentinal cavities (Markowitz and Pashley 2008). Another study suggests an elaborate ATP-mediated signaling pathway is potentially at work, where metabotropic and ionotropic ATP receptors were found in odontoblasts (Chung </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2016). ATP-induced calcium currents caused activation of ionotropic and metabotropic ATP receptors, which provided a basis for sensory processing and suggested the possibility of secondary messenger involvement (Chung </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2016). The precise physiological role of the ATP receptors in relation to the K</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ca</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> channels remains unclear. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">     Another major mechano-sensitive channel seen in odontoblasts are the TREK-1 potassium channels. These channels are open at resting membrane potential and gated by various stimuli such as stretch, heat, and changes in pH. These channels are more concentrated towards the coronal portion of the dentinal tubule and less common towards the pulpal region (Bleicher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2009). This specific distribution inside the dentinal tubule suggests a highly regulated mechanism behind the signal transduction and potentially different levels of regulation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><b><i>Transient Receptor Potential Channels</i></b><b><i>
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">     Several lines of research found transient receptor potential (TRP) channels to also be involved in the signal transduction pathway. TRP channels regulate the entry of ions like calcium, which in turn regulates sensory functions in odontoblasts. Ichinohe </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> found that TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV4 (channels of the TRP subfamily) functioned in the transduction of mechanical and osmotic stimuli, while TRPM8 was not active in this process (2013). It should be noted, however, that these results were only found on mouse odontoblasts. In a recent study performed on freshly isolated native human odontoblasts, Ikeda </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> found that TRPM8 (transient receptor potential melastatin 8) plays a role in detecting external cold stimulation (2017). This finding highlights the important principle that data from non-human models may not be representative of normal human model function.    </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></i><b><i>Excitatory Substance P</i></b><b><i>
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">     </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Although human models are ideal to uncover the mechanisms behind the signal transduction pathway, a few other key discoveries have been made through Black </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.’s study on narwhal’s odontoblasts (2014). As mentioned earlier, the microscopic nature of the dentinal tubules has made it difficult to uncover the molecules at play. As such, narwhals with large tusks measuring anywhere between 1.5 to 3.1 meters on average have offered more complete imaging of the dentinal tubule network (Black </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. 2014). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">     As discussed earlier, it is known that both myelinated A fibers and unmyelinated C sensory fibers are found around the odontoblasts, organized in different layers (Black </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. 2014). A unique characteristic of the C fibers is that they contain Substance P, a neuropeptide that coexists with glutamate in primary afferents and is ultimately involved in pain perception (Black </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. 2014). Immunohistochemical studies in narwhals found localization of substance P largely restricted to odontoblasts’ cell bodies and processes in the dentinal tubules, suggesting a potential role in promoting excitatory impulses and action potentials to the CNS (Black </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. 2014).</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">It should be noted that narwhal’s dentinal tubules are open to the environment, unlike human enamel, which occludes the dentinal tubules. As such, the mechanistic properties of odontoblasts in narwhals may differ, although the confirmation and localization of Substance P in narwhals are useful for future human-model studies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><b><i>New Research Findings</i></b><b><i>
</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">     Recent cutting-edge research suggests aspirin could have restorative effects on tooth decay. The method behind this research involves increasing the expression of odontoblast genes, ultimately enhancing the odontoblasts’ ability to make dentin (Du e</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">t al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2017). Aspirin not only promotes dentin formation, but also inhibits inflammation (Du e</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">t al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2017). Since tooth decay yields significant financial costs through requiring additional dental treatments, this finding has significant implications worldwide through financial aspects and providing alternatives to current treatments.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">     Low power laser therapy is a recent innovative approach designed to regenerate dentin. The concept behind this involves laser activated transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which differentiates neural crest cells into odontoblasts, promoting dentinogenesis and possibly mechano-sensory abilities (Arany </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">2014). The implications behind the effects laser activated TGF-β1could have on the odontoblasts’ mechano-sensory abilities are not clear yet. Thus, as we improve our understanding of the structures and ions involved in odontoblasts’ signal transduction pathway, we can better understand how these new treatments interact with odontoblasts and dentin.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">

</span><b><i>Conclusion</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">     While significant progress has been made in discovering microstructural elements involved with odontoblasts, greater clarification is needed. A closer look at the precise mechanisms that occur during the signal transduction process is necessary to solidify odontoblasts’ secondary role as mechano-sensory cells. In particular, we now have a greater understanding of the channels at play as well as confirmation of structures, such as Substance P, TREK-1 channels, and primary cilium. Transient Receptor Potential Channels highlight the fact that there may be multiple different signal transduction mechanisms at play dependent on the external stimuli, such as TRPM8, which is specific in detecting external cold stimulation. Brännström’s hydrodynamic theory of tooth sensitivity is supported to this day. Recent potential treatments to dentin regeneration and alleviation of tooth decay demand a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved with odontoblasts as well as other cells in the human tooth. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">By Sofie Bates</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> At the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting this year, I had the opportunity to listen to Dr. Pablo Ross from UC Davis present in a panel discussion on gene editing to create xenogeneic organs. I wrote this article to highlight interesting research that is being done by researchers around the country and right here at UC Davis. I hope that this article will explain xenogeneic organ production—a revolutionary development in the future of medicine—and push readers to think about related bioethical issues and future directions. </span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">The idea of replacing one of your organs with an organ from a pig probably doesn’t sound too appealing. But, for the twenty people that die every day in the US from end stage organ failure, organs from animals could save their lives. Currently there is a huge organ shortage in the United States. Over a hundred thousand patients are already on waiting lists for an organ transplant, prompting many researchers to look for a solution.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">On Feb. 18, Dr. Pablo Ross, an associate professor of animal science at UC Davis, presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) conference in Austin, Texas. Scientists like Dr. Ross are researching how to make xenogeneic organs for human transplant. Xenogeneic organ production is similar to xenotransplantation, a process in which an organ or tissue from an animal is transplanted into a human. Human cells are injected into a pig embryo, where they develop into a full-sized organ after about six months. Then the organ is harvested and transplanted into a human patient. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">One of the biggest issues with organ transplants is organ rejection, which occurs when a patient has an immune response to the organ. Novel stem-cell based therapeutics using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a type of genetically-engineered stem cell capable of becoming nearly any cell in the human body, may provide a solution to this problem. Using iPSCs creates a xenogeneic organ that is composed of human cells but still has the same size and shape as the organ in the host species. “We don’t expect to grow a human organ inside a pig,” Dr. Ross explained at a press briefing at the 2018 AAAS meeting. “We expect to grow a pig organ full of human cells.” Researchers hope that using human iPSCs will reduce the risk of organ rejection, rendering xenogeneic organ transplants a viable option.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">To reduce immune rejection even further, Dr. Hiromitsu Nakauchi, a professor and researcher at Stanford University, hopes to develop patient-specific organs by blastocyst complementation. This method involves injecting human iPSCs from the patient into a blastocyst— a structure present in early embryonic development in mammals— from the organ donor species. This produces an organ made of the patient’s own cells. The aim of this method is to allow the patient’s immune system to recognize the transplant organ as “self,” minimizing the risk of immune rejection. “[Inter-species blastocyst complementation] would solve two of the main issues of organ transplantation: source of organs and potential for immune rejection,” explained Dr. Ross. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">One of the most prominent bioethical concerns regarding xenogeneic organ production, however, is whether human iPSCs migrate to other tissues in the donor animal. Human iPSCs could potentially embed in tissues like the brain or gonads, which could raise bioethical concerns about “humanization” of the host animal. However, Dr. Nakauchi proposed using livestock animals, which are less genetically similar to humans, instead of non-human primates to decrease this risk. This makes livestock animals more ethical host species for xenogeneic organic production.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although these recent breakthroughs are promising, further research must be done before xenogeneic organs are a viable solution to the organ shortage problem. “We need to come up with different strategies to increase the efficiency of these </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in vivo </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">human-porcine chimeric embryos,” said Dr. Daniel Garry, a professor of medicine at the Lillehei Heart Institute, in his presentation during the session at AAAS. Discoveries like blastocyst complementation bring us one step closer to solving the organ shortage problem; however, before xenogeneic organ transplants become common in hospitals, researchers must streamline the process, address bioethical concerns, and minimize the risk of immune rejection. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Author’s Note: After taking Introduction to Microbiology (MIC 102), I became interested in microbes, living organisms that surround us but are largely invisible to the naked eye. One area of research that particularly fascinates me involves the use of microbes that naturally inhabit the human body to treat infections and diseases. I wanted to share the findings of a research study focused on one such microbe, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, because of the significant implications and potential for further development demonstrated by the research findings. </span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">Human skin harbors diverse microbial communities, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is one of the predominant bacterial species that colonizes the normal skin surface. Some strains of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> are commensal and therefore benefit from inhabiting the human skin environment but do not harm the host. In a recently published research study, Nakatsuji et al. (2018) reported that specific commensal strains of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> produce 6-N-hydroxyaminopurine (6-HAP), a molecule that is capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis selectively in tumor cells. The ability of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">to defend against tumor growth possesses important implications in the future treatment of skin cancer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">6-HAP interferes with DNA synthesis because its molecular structure mimics that of adenine. Nakatsuji et al. found that in the presence of 6-HAP, DNA extension was blocked when the template required adenine to pair with thymidine but functioned normally during cytosine-guanine base pairing. Furthermore, 6-HAP disrupted DNA synthesis in a melanoma cell line but did not affect Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEKs). NHEKs are not susceptible to 6-HAP activity because they contain mitochondrial amidoxime reducing components (mARCs), powerful enzymes that reduce imitative compounds like 6-HAP to normal nucleotide bases. Consequently, 6-HAP is rendered to adenine in the presence of mARCs and DNA synthesis functions as normal within the cell. As expected, the expression of mARCs was discovered to be much higher in NHEKs than in the 6-HAP-sensitive melanoma cell line. The study suggests that 6-HAP is thus able to specifically target skin tumor cells to suppress their proliferation in culture. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Nakatsuji et al. also investigated 6-HAP’s ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Among mice injected with melanoma cells, some received 6-HAP injections while others received mock injections. The results showed that tumor size was suppressed by more than 60% in mice that were administered 6-HAP compared to those that were not.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The research team conducted further experiments to examine how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> affects the skin surface. Scientists topically applied </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> on hairless mice before exposing them to UV radiation for 12 weeks. While some mice received a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> strain that produces 6-HAP, others got a strain that does not. Researchers found that mice colonized with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that makes 6-HAP formed tumors of significantly smaller size compared to mice colonized with the control strain. Predictably, the mice that received treatment from the 6-HAP-producing strain also developed fewer tumors overall.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The research findings highlight the potential for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to protect against tumor growth and carry significant implications in the future treatment of skin cancer. Perhaps 6-HAP could be extracted from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> strains and harnessed to synthesize skin cancer drugs. It is also plausible for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to be transferred from individuals bearing 6-HAP-producing strains to those who do not, as a way to ward off skin cancer. For now, these ideas are merely possibilities as additional studies are necessary to understand the biosynthesis and regulation of 6-HAP in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, as well as the interactions between bacteria and host. Undoubtedly, this discovery has opened doors by defining a new role for human skin bacteria as a line of defense.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s note:</strong> I wrote this literature review for UWP104F, Writing for Health Professions. The assignment was to write a literature review on a health-related topic of our choosing. I decided to write this literature review on ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, the primary cause of death in ecstasy overdoses. I want to inform researchers on potential drug options or treatments that could be further explored for use in treating ecstasy-using patients. I also want to reveal areas for further consideration. My hope is that this literature review will spark greater interest on the topic and guide future research into exploring new treatment options for ecstasy-induced hyperthermia.</span>

<b>Abstract</b>

<b>Background: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Ecstasy-induced hyperthermia is a public health concern that plagues the music scene. Few studies exist that evaluate mechanisms and treatment options for hyperthermia. These mechanisms and treatment options are complex and expansive, and little research has been conducted to fully evaluate our understanding of the disease. </span>

<b>Aim: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The aim of this literature review is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia by describing, summarizing, and comparing current literature on the topic. This literature review hopes to guide future research into treatment options for ecstasy-induced hyperthermia.</span>

<b>Results: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Ecstasy-induced hyperthermia was found to be a result of two processes in the body: thermogenesis via UCP-3 uncoupling, and vasoconstriction via multiple mechanisms. These processes are complex, and this literature review provides a general overview of pathways involving hyperthermia. Treatment options were evaluated from animal studies and case studies conducted on humans. The results of this review show that few drug options exist for humans. Current palliative options for treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia have also been shown to be largely ineffective in attenuating the disease.</span>

<b>Conclusions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The findings of this literature review show that potential and new drug candidates should be evaluated for use in treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in humans. The results also indicate a number of new palliative options for treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, including new cooling methods and surgical interventions.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">For decades, psychoactive stimulants have been used to enhance musical experiences. One of the most commonly abused of these stimulants is the illegal substance ecstasy, also known as 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA. Ecstasy has become the quintessential party drug for concert-goers across the United States (6). In a case study of a rave event in San Francisco, twelve patients were admitted to the hospital for complications arising from ecstasy use, with two succumbing to death (2). Many of these deaths were a consequence of organ failure as a result of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, or overheating of the body (1). Ecstasy has become a public health concern that plagues the live music scene, and will continue to be a problem for the foreseeable future.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">This literature review will evaluate the current state of knowledge on ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. Because ecstasy is a difficult substance to acquire and test for research purposes, much of this knowledge will come from research conducted on animal models. However, results from these experiments will reveal potential mechanisms of hyperthermia in humans, and implicate treatment options that should be investigated by medical researchers. The next section of this literature review will describe these mechanisms to provide background on how hyperthermia is induced. These mechanisms will describe major pathways that are currently targeted by drug options to alleviate hyperthermia. The discussion section at the end of this literature review will describe areas of consideration for medical researchers, using our current understanding of the mechanisms of hyperthermia and gaps in our current knowledge to guide medical researchers on potential targets and pathways of interest. This literature review will thus provide a comprehensive background on the mechanisms and treatment options for ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, and guide future research to combat this public health concern.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Mechanisms of Ecstasy-Induced Hyperthermia</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Hyperthermia is an adverse effect that presents following ecstasy consumption. However, there is no one pathway that characterizes hyperthermia in its entirety. The following sections will describe the currently understood mechanisms of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. Although many of these mechanisms were determined using animal models, these mechanisms give valuable insight into potential mechanisms of human thermogenesis. </span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vasoconstriction via the 5-HT pathway modulates thermogenesis</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In an early study to investigate the mechanisms of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, Pedersen and Blessing (2001) measured changes in cutaneous blood flow in rabbits to elucidate whether hyperthermia was a result of increased or decreased blood flow in the body. The researchers administered ecstasy and measured “blood flow, pressure, and temperature signals,” (13, p. 8649) as well as heart rate, using a probe inserted into the rabbits (13). Rabbits underwent unilateral cervical sympathectomies</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and the blood flow in each ear was compared (13). Heart pressure was observed to have increased, with no change to heart rate (13). In addition, the unilateral cervical sympathectomy was shown to increase blood flow in the ear and minimize the effects of hyperthermia (13). These findings suggested that vasoconstriction was the primary cause of hyperthermia in the rabbits (13). These findings also pointed to the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on vasoconstriction and thus hyperthermia in the rabbits (13). Previous studies, conducted by Blessing and Nalivaiko (2000), found that 5-HT (serotonin) released from “raphe magnus-pallidus neurons” (4, p. 289) acted upon 5-HT</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2A</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> receptors in the spine, leading to vasoconstriction in rabbits (12; 13). Pedersen &amp; Blessing (2001) thus hypothesized that ecstasy stimulated the release of 5-HT to activate 5-HT</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2A </span><span style="font-weight: 400">receptors on the “perikarya and dendrites of preganglionic sympathetic cutaneous vasomotor neurons,” (13, p. 8653) leading to the vasoconstriction observed in the animals. This vasoconstriction would prevent the release of heat in the blood to the environment, leading to hyperthermia (13). These findings reveal important mechanisms and pathways of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia that should be targeted for treatment.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thermogenesis via the UCP3 pathway</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Research conducted by Mills et al. (2003) later showed that a different pathway also mediated ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. To investigate the role of uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) in ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, Mills et al. (2003) administered ecstasy to UCP-3 deficient mice. The study found that UCP-3 deficient mice showed reduced thermogenesis after ecstasy administration compared to wild type mice (9). In addition, UCP-3 deficient mice showed greater tolerance to ecstasy, and could survive a typically lethal dose (9). In a subsequent review, Mills, Rusyniak, and Sprague (2004) clarify the mechanism of heat production by UCP-3. Previous studies have shown that UCPs</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> are mitochondrial membrane proteins that transport protons (H+ ions) from one side of the membrane to the other, producing energy that would normally be used to convert ADP to ATP (10). With UCP-3, a process known as uncoupling may occur, where this energy is lost as heat (10). It has also been shown that ecstasy can induce release of norepinephrine, which in turn leads to activation of UCP, resulting in thermogenesis (10). However, the precise mechanism in which norepinephrine affects UCP is not currently known</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> (10). Despite this, it is clear that UCP-3 is involved in ecstasy-induced hyperthermia.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Insulin, Glucose, and Free Fatty Acids (FFA) Facilitate Uncoupling through UCP-3</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Following prior research conducted on UCP-3, Banks et al. (2009) investigated the role of insulin on ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. Prior research had shown that increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the blood amplified hyperthermia following ecstasy administration by increasing uncoupling in UCP-3 (3). Banks et al. (2009) hypothesized that insulin, which is involved in the transport of FFA and glucose into cells, would play a role in ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. In the study, healthy and insulin-resistant rats were given different treatments of saline (control), ecstasy, or ecstasy/ glucose/ insulin (3). Hyperthermia was observed following administration of ecstasy, and rats that were also given insulin and glucose experienced a greater degree of hyperthermia than the other treatment groups (3). In addition, rats that were given ecstasy also exhibited increased insulin levels (3). The findings supported the conclusion that insulin modulates ecstasy-induced hyperthermia through transport of FFA and glucose into the cell that would lead to uncoupling in UCP-3 (3). However, it remains unclear how ecstasy increases insulin levels in the body</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> (3).</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">FAT/CD36</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">as Transporter of FFA</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Much like insulin, the transporter FAT/CD36 is known to be a regulator of FFA levels in the blood (7). In a study conducted on rodent models, Hrometz et al. (2016) investigated the contribution of FAT/CD36 in ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. Exercised and sedentary rats were given either DMSO (a control), SSO (an inhibitor of FAT/CD36), ecstasy, or ecstasy/SSO and monitored for hyperthermia (7). The results revealed that treatment with SSO led to a reduction in hyperthermia in both the sedentary and exercised rats (7). In addition, UCP-3 expression was found to have increased in the exercise group (7). These findings suggested that FAT/CD36 is an important mediator of hyperthermia, and that exercise could exacerbate hyperthermia by increasing levels of UCP-3 in the mitochondria (7). The mechanisms in which exercise increases expression of UCP-3 is still unclear (11).</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Strategies to Combat Ecstasy-Induced Hyperthermia</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In the following sections, I will briefly highlight potential treatment options that have implications in combating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. These treatment options fall into two categories: drug options that target the pathways described above, or palliative options that target the symptoms of hyperthermia. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Drug Options</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">SSO (Sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate)</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As described in the previous section, SSO is an inhibitor of FAT/CD36 that can reduce ecstasy-induced hyperthermia (7). SSO acts an antagonist of FAT/CD36, binding to the transporter to prevent the interaction of FAT/CD36 with FFA (5). When administered to rats, SSO was shown to reduce ecstasy-induced hyperthermia (7). However, SSO is not a currently used drug, and has not been tested on humans.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clozapine</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Clozapine is an antipsychotic drug that has potential to reduce ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in humans (8). Experiments conducted by Kiyatkin et al. (2015) on rats have shown that clozapine can significantly reduce hyperthermia in situations mimicking recreational human use.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> As described by Kiyatkin et al. (2015), clozapine acts as a inhibitor of vasoconstriction in the body, increasing heat exchange between the body and the environment. The results of the study also showed that rats that were given clozapine following ecstasy administration showed “good health” (8, p. 553) compared to the control group, which was observed to have a 25% death rate (8). It is important to note, however, that these findings only apply to the rats in the study. Clozapine has yet to be tested on humans to treat ecstasy-induced hyperthermia.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Carvedilol</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Kiyatkin et al. (2015) showed that carvedilol, an -adrenoceptor and -adrenoceptor</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> antagonist, could also reduce the magnitude of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in rats following ecstasy administration. These findings are a result of inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system by carvedilol, reducing vasoconstriction in the body (8). Like clozapine, rats given carvedilol showed no signs of illness following ecstasy administration (8). Despite the success of carvedilol to treat ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in rats, carvedilol has yet to be tested on humans to treat hyperthermia.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">THC (Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol)</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">THC is a drug that is typically found in</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> cannabis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, or marijuana. As described by Taffe (2012), THC has often been taken in conjunction with ecstasy to reduce negative side effects of ecstasy. In a study to investigate the potential for THC to reduce ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in humans, Taffe (2012) administered ecstasy to rhesus monkeys with and without THC. The results of the study showed that THC could reduce significantly reduce hyperthermia in monkeys (14). This is due to the action of THC on the CB</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> receptor in the brain, since activating the CB</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> receptor has been shown to induce hypothermia (14). Although CB</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1 </span><span style="font-weight: 400">receptors are found in the human body, the efficacy of THC to treat ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in humans has yet to be evaluated.</span>

<b>Figure 1</b><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Potential drug options to treat ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, based on literature evaluated in this review. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Palliative Options</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ice packs, cooling blankets, endovascular cooling catheter</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Direct cooling of the body is one type of palliative treatment used to combat ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. Ice packs can be “placed in the groin and/or axillae,” (2, p. 255) or cooling blankets can be placed over the body (2). Although these methods of cooling are typical for many hospitals, it can often take hours before body temperatures are lowered to acceptable levels</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> (1). This presents an issue, as increases in duration of hyperthermia is associated with increases in mortality (1). Endovascular cooling catheters can also be used, and have been shown to have success in clinical outcomes (1). However, the case study conducted by Antoine et al. (2018) is the only known use of endovascular cooling catheters to treat ecstasy-induced hyperthermia</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Multiorgan support</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Multiorgan support is another type of palliative treatment used to combat complications arising from ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. Although multiorgan support does not address the hyperthermia itself, it can prolong life and increase prognosis for patients who are undergoing cooling (1). In the case study presented by Antoine et al. (2018), “escalating vasopressor and inotropic support” (1) were used to support the patient’s organs after organ failure was detected. Despite the success of multiorgan support, however, multiorgan support merely serves as a bandaid to slow-acting cooling methods that are currently used.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fasciotomy</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Surgical intervention by fasciotomy, where fibers are cut to relieve tension in muscles, have also shown promise in treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia (1). Ecstasy toxicity has been shown to lead to compartment syndrome, where muscle tension can lead to pressure and constriction of blood vessels (1). A fasciotomy can thus be administered to relieve blood flow in affected areas of the body, allowing for generalized reduction of vasoconstriction and leading to increased heat dissipation to the environment (1). According to Antoine et al. (2018), fasciotomies are not commonly used to treat hyperthermia. The case study presented by Antoine et al. (2018) is one of the few that have shown the procedure’s success.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cervical sympathectomy </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Another surgical intervention that has shown promise is the cervical sympathectomy, which was conducted by Pedersen and Blessing (2001) in their study on rabbits. The procedure was shown to have increased blood flow in the ear of the rabbit and minimize the effects of hyperthermia (13). However, the procedure has not been explored on humans, and its efficacy has only been shown in rabbits (13).</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Areas for Consideration and Further Research</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As shown in the previous section of this literature review, treatment options for ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in humans are limited. Carvedilol, clozapine, SSO, and THC are four potential drug options that have been shown to be effective in rodents (7; 8) and rhesus monkeys (14), but have not been tested in humans. Clinical research is needed to determine the efficacy of these drugs to treat ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in humans.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Pathways of hyperthermia can also serve as potential pharmacological targets for drugs. The 5-HT/ 5-HT</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2A</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> receptor pathway, for example, has been implicated in ecstasy-induced vasoconstriction (13). Research should be conducted to evaluate drugs that can inhibit the 5-HT/ 5-HT</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2A</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> receptor pathway. In addition, vasodilating drugs such as nitroglycerin should also be considered for use in reducing ecstasy-induced vasoconstriction.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Thermogenesis is another mechanism of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia that lacks drug options for treatment. Previous studies have shown that uncoupling in UCP-3 induces ecstasy-induced hyperthermia (3; 9; 10). Research should be conducted to evaluate drugs that can reduce insulin levels in the body, or decrease sensitivity to insulin. In addition, research should be conducted to evaluate drugs that can sequester FFA levels in the blood and reduce UCP-3 expression in the mitochondria. These findings may lead to clinical applications in reducing mitochondrial thermogenesis.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Much like the drug options described in this literature review, palliative options for treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia are also limited (see Figure 2). Surgical therapy and fasciotomies are palliative treatment options that can be used to counteract vasoconstriction in humans. Cervical sympathectomies have also been shown to reduce vasoconstriction in rabbit models, but have not been proven in humans (13). Further research is necessary to determine the efficacy of surgical interventions in attenuating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Other palliative options for treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia generally involved active cooling procedures, including the use of cooling blankets, ice packs, and endovascular catheters (1; 2). However, many of these procedures have not been shown to be effective (2). Antoine et al. (2018), in their case study, found that the endovascular catheters were more effective than the other cooling procedures. However, this study was the only one of its kind to utilize the endovascular catheter to treat ecstasy-induced hyperthermia (1). Further research should be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the endovascular catheter in treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. In addition, alternative cooling methods should also be investigated, including the use of chilled artificial respirators as a supplement to organ support and industrial fans to increase convection of heat away from the body. </span>

<b>Limitations</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This literature review incorporates articles that are greater than 5 years old, with the oldest article published in 2000. However, these articles serve as major findings in the literature for ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, and are continuously cited and self-cited by researchers in the field. Many of these articles were thus included in the article despite age concerns. This literature review may not fully address every possible drug or palliative option for treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia, but should serve as a suitable starting point to guide further research in the area.</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Ecstasy-induced hyperthermia is a growing public health concern that plagues the live music scene. This literature review provides a limited report on our current understanding of the disease in order to guide future research in the area. The findings of this review have revealed two mechanisms of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia: thermogenesis via UCP-3 uncoupling, and vasoconstriction via complex mechanisms. Further research should evaluate the efficacy of potential drug options, including clozapine, carvedilol, THC, SSO, in treating ecstasy-induced hyperthermia in humans. In addition, new drug candidates should be explored that target the pathways of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia described in this review, including the UCP-3/FFA/insulin pathway and the 5-HT/5-HT</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2A</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> pathway. Furthermore, palliative treatment options for use in clinical settings, including current and new cooling options, need to be disseminated to healthcare practitioners. Chilled artificial respirators and industrial fans are cooling options that may have implications in alleviating hyperthermia in most clinical settings. Surgical therapies such as the fasciotomy and cervical sympathectomy should also be explored for use in alleviating hyperthermia in humans. The findings presented in this review may one day lead to new and effective treatment options for ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. These new treatment options will be crucial in the fight against a growing epidemic in public health and may, with any luck, eventually save lives. </span>

Along the way, I often found myself lost in a world of complicated scientific jargon. In the end, it was a personal story that provided the inspiration I needed for this article. Worldwide, more than 70,000 people have cystic fibrosis, and there are over 30,000 patients in the United States alone. Mary Frey is one of them, and she chronicles her life alongside Peter, her husband, and Ollie, her service dog, in daily vlogs on their YouTube channel. With “The Frey Life,” I was reminded that scientific research, which might sometimes seem removed from the realities of life, should be rooted in the spirit of helping people. This message guided and energized my research on cystic fibrosis.</span> <span style="font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline">I thank Dr. Brenda Rinard for her valuable instruction, which shaped this review article throughout the writing process.</span></p>

One such disease, cystic fibrosis, serves as an excellent window into the field of personalized medicine. The following review article examines the current state of cystic fibrosis research, in the process detailing recent studies on the correlations, or lack thereof, between mutant genotypes and disease phenotypes. Knowledge of these relationships is incomplete, necessitating the need for further patient population studies and drug treatment tests. Toward the end of the article, studies on the effects of certain cystic fibrosis drugs currently in the pipeline are presented. With future findings, clinical treatment of cystic fibrosis can be significantly improved by our foundational understanding of the effects of personalized medicine on the individual. Treatments targeting cystic fibrosis genotypes are a promising alternative to the existing and often unsuccessful clinical methodologies, which place an emphasis on the symptoms of the disease.</span></p>

The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which controls the expression of chloride and bicarbonate ion channels in the plasma membrane of respiratory and epithelial cells (2). An imbalance in the number of ion channels or a decrease in the probability of open channels triggers several physiological issues, including mucus buildup, inflammation of lung tissue, and bacterial infection (2, 3). Medical approaches with a focus on treating these symptoms, among others, have proven insubstantially effective in slowing the development of the disease (2). </span></p>

Despite the present body of research into these genetic relationships, the extent of the correlation between cystic fibrosis genotype and phenotype is largely unknown. A thorough and complete understanding of the mechanisms by which genotype influences phenotype is crucial to the development of personalized approaches to medical treatment. Through an analysis of the underlying genotype-to-phenotype relationships, we present an evaluation of existing methods of disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Future research, if effectively designed and executed, could potentially reveal new avenues toward successful, targeted treatments of cystic fibrosis.</span></p>

Classifications of high-risk and low-risk genotypes, if properly assigned through an evaluation of phenotypic disease severity and protein production levels, are a useful tool for predicting disease progression (8, 9). Ninety-three percent of individuals with CFTR mutations recorded in the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) patient registry were classified as having a high-risk genotype. These individuals with a high-risk genotype were 2.25 times less likely to survive than the seven percent of individuals with a low-risk genotype (8). In a further exploration of the data available from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, patient survival was correlated with sweat chloride concentrations and again with genotypic-risk groups: as sweat chloride concentration and risk group of the genotype increased, survival decreased (9). Patients with at least partially functional CFTR proteins experienced prolonged survival in comparison to those with fully non-functional CFTR proteins (9). In several studies, effects of phenotypic factors on survival were shown to be statistically insignificant, linking defective genotypes directly to disease severity and transforming gene sequences into a reliable forecaster of survival likelihood (3, 7, 8).</span></p>

Information on rare mutations (RMs) is absent from the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) database, which catalogues the currently-known CFTR mutations and reports associations between the mutations and corresponding phenotypes (6). This lack of data presents medicine with challenges when trying to diagnose and treat patients whose gene sequences include RMs. Additionally, the range of disease-related symptoms seen in patients with cystic fibrosis cannot be explained simply by mutations in the CFTR gene (2, 6, 10, 11, 12). In the following section, alternative correlational factors and diagnostic methods are discussed. These variables could potentially prove to be more reliable predictors of disease diagnosis and progression, or explain more fully the mechanisms behind genotype-to-phenotype relationships.</span></p>

As a result of the incomplete data described above, research has suggested that sweat chloride concentration and nasal potential difference measurements are more effective tools in clinical diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (6, 13). Arguably, a number of phenotypic factors might influence the responses of individual patients to certain CFTR mutation-specific therapies. The effects of CFTR mutations can be noticed at any age in varying degrees of intensity: for any given age and genetic background, phenotypes can vary (5). While many studies take exhaustive steps to ensure that differing levels of disease severity are indeed caused by genetic variation, there exist significant limitations to research that makes conclusions in favor of direct genotype-to-phenotype correlations (at least in the context previously discussed). Environmental variables, such as poor nutrition, might very well affect pancreatic insufficiency, just as the variability in pulmonary function likely affects the severity of cystic fibrosis disease symptoms (5, 6).</span></p>

An assessment of the Canadian cystic fibrosis population analyzed the pleiotropic effects of genetic modifiers on patient survival and disease prognosis (12). Pleiotropic modifiers make a complete understanding of the complex relationships between cystic fibrosis genotype and phenotype difficult to achieve (12). Further research demonstrates the role that multiple modifier gene loci play in the severity of cystic fibrosis-related lung disease (10). The complications caused by these genetic modifiers create significant obstacles in the process of formulating correlations between genotype and phenotype. The resulting deficit in molecular and mechanical understanding necessitates further research, the specifics of which are elucidated in the next section. </span></p>

Genetic analysis loses its value in diagnosing cystic fibrosis if identified rare mutations are uncharacterized by CFTR databases (14). To improve the cataloguing of rare mutations in CFTR databases, centers for cystic fibrosis should continue to record this data (6). To understand the disease-causing potential of rare mutations, data must also be catalogued from a larger population. This is the current aim of the developing CFTR3 database (6).</span></p>

The study established a methodology for testing the effect of a mutation by using the ratio of CFTR-dependent “C-sweat” secreted from an individual to CFTR-independent “M-sweat” secreted from that same individual (3). To record sweat ratios, CFTR-independent M-sweating was induced with methacholine and then experimentally inhibited, triggering the production of CFTR-dependent C-sweating (3). Usually, sweat-chloride concentration tests are unreliable indicators of functioning CFTR levels, but C-sweat/M-sweat testing allows for the control of variations in sweat volume between two patients, eliminating some of the variables encountered in the previous section (3). Since the process that generates C-sweat is dependent on the functionality of CFTR, greater C-sweat/M-sweat ratios can be interpreted to indicate that the CFTR protein was functioning at a higher level (3). The presence of ivacaftor prompted larger sweat ratios (3). Therefore, ivacaftor is considered a useful treatment for certain CFTR mutations. Other pharmaceutical drugs are currently undergoing development, including some that have progressed to clinical trials (2). </span></p>

Based on the current body of research, it is widely understood and accepted that cystic fibrosis phenotypes are influenced by CFTR mutations, but in what way and to what extent remains unclear. Furthermore, disease phenotypes cannot be explained simply as a result of CFTR mutations. Before drawing experimental conclusions or designing clinical methods for treatment, any well-rounded and complete analysis of disease severity should consider genetic modifiers, environmental variables, and the effects of other phenotypic factors. On a larger scale, the correlations between genotype and phenotype described throughout this literature review seem to accurately predict population dynamics, but until further genetic analyses, clinical experiments, and pharmaceutical research can be completed, the present state of cystic fibrosis research advises against the specific diagnosis of an individual on the basis of genotype-to-phenotype correlations.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">By Sabrina Lazar, Cell Biology  ‘20</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Author's note: After attending an interesting meeting on cytoskeleton dynamics in the weekly Joint Seminars in Molecular Biology series, I wanted to learn more about the subject and found Anna Franz and her colleagues’ recent paper about fat cells in Drosophila, a model organism I work with and is dear to me. This essay serves as a way for me to share fascinating research with those that are interested in Drosophila, cells, or biology in general.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">In general, those with some knowledge of biology will explain that fat tissue exists to store energy.  However, science has progressed in recent years with the discovery of previously unknown functions of common tissue types. In this vein, a new paper surfaced in the February 2018 issue of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Developmental Cell</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> titled “Fat Body Cells are Motile and Actively Migrate to Wounds to Drive Repair and Prevent Infection.” In their experiment, Franz et al sought to learn all about how adipocytes, also referred to as fat body cells, function at microscopic laser wound sites in Drosophila. Anna Franz, the first author of the paper, outlines the current state of fat research, saying there is a “growing realization that adipocytes… have numerous other roles in various tissues in health and disease” [2].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The team found that the adipocytes are capable of motion and move towards gaps in the external epithelial tissue, which can be thought of as open wounds. To create these gaps, a fine laser was used to create small epithelial wounds in the flies’ ventral thorax, an area with very low adipocyte density.  This tested if cells could first travel to this distant spot and then would track their behavior at the target location. Franz reports the cells were “highly dynamic” in their journey, and that once there, the cells “remained tightly associated with the wound” and remained there until the broken epithelium was restored [2]. To ensure this was not a random motion driven by passive fluid, the team tracked individual cells under fluorescence microscopy and saw the cells move independently in the direction of the wound. Tagging specific proteins involved in cellular movement with colorful fluorescent molecules allowed the researchers to observe and track fat body cells traveling and coordinating to the open space as time progressed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The team also used live fluorescent imaging of the actin proteins in the cytoskeleton to understand how exactly the adipocyte movement mechanism worked. What they found was a undulation of actin strands from the cell cortex; the long actin fibers comprising the adipocyte’s cytoskeleton were oscillating in a wave-like motion, driving the entire cell in the opposing direction of the waves. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">By elucidating the adipocytes’ activities once they swam toward the cut, the team brought forth the next advancement. The researchers found that hemocytes in Drosophila</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> similar to macrophages, cells that defend the body by destroying bacteria and harmful particles</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and adipocytes coordinate at the wound. It was already known that hemocytes help clear debris from the wound entrance [1], but when the hemocytes were inhibited, the team saw that the debris continued to be swept away, but by adipocytes. The observation exhibited a possible association between the immune system and fat body cells. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Since adipocytes are relatively large compared to other cells, the group hypothesized that they might play a role in sealing the wound gap to prevent infection. Examination under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed very close association between adipocytes and the broken epithelium, “leaving a gap of less than 20nm”[2]. Furthermore, fluorescently tagging actin regulatory proteins revealed that the adipocytes coordinating at the site extended membrane projections to reach around and out of the epithelial gap to seal off the gash.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Franz’s next steps are to branch out to other vertebrates to connect their findings with all kinds of eukaryotes, including humans. Other scientists have already started to branch out. Schmidt and Horsley found that mouse adipocytes function similarly to the ones in Drosophila in their 2013 paper [4]. In 2012, Osborn and Olefsky investigated “obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance”, and found that due to overnutrition, Drosophila adipocytes recruit macrophages to enter adipose (fat) tissue, which triggers inflammation and consequent insulin resistance [3]. Franz et al. concluded with the linkage between immune and fat body cells, and how they could be relevant to human diseases. Future research that looks more into the relationship between hemocytes and adipocytes can provide valuable insight into the cellular causes of diseases like Type II diabetes.  </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Emily Villarreal, Nutrition Science (Biology Emphasis), 2018</strong>

<strong>Author’s Note:</strong> This literature review was written for a UWP 104F course. I chose this topic because the gut microbiota is something that I am deeply interested in as a student researcher. The audience for this review includes medical professionals or members of academia who are interested in the microbiota and its effects on the onset of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

<!--more-->
<strong>Abstract</strong>
<strong>Background:</strong> Recently, disturbances in the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the causes of many gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. As the field of study grows, exciting discoveries are being made through new genome sequencing techniques. It has been found that the gut flora participates in digestion by synthesizing macromolecules, vitamins, and metabolize xenobiotics and other foreign materials for the host. Now, researchers are hypothesizing that disturbances in these functions may be the cause of many GI tract diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This literature review will explore the relationship between the human GI tract microbiota and IBD.

<strong>Methods:</strong> When searching for relevant material, Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms were used, such as “human gut microbiota,” “gut microbiome,” “gut flora,” and “inflammatory bowel disease.” Inclusion protocol included a flexible date range and required specific subject matter.

<strong>Findings:</strong> Through the secondary analysis of multiple sources, it was found that there is a strong relationship between the human gut microbiota and the onset of IBD. Many studies allude to the idea that an imbalance of the gut microbiota, termed gut dysbiosis, is a key modulator in triggering an IBD. In addition to this phenomenon, it was also found that dysbiosis contributed two main methods of pathogenesis: altered short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism and increased sulfur metabolism. Both of these pathways were shown to have individual effects on causing inflammation in the GI tract by many sources.

<strong>Relevance:</strong> Overall, this analysis provides a reason for additional research within this field. The gut microbiota serves many functions, and if these functions are properly investigated, solutions to GI tract conditions like IBD may be found. Once the overall pathogenic mechanisms are elucidated, researchers should be able to begin testing new methods for IBD control and treatment. Promising articles have already been published regarding the use of probiotics and anti-TNF-α as a method of IBD treatment, thus partially confirming the hypotheses stated above.

<strong>Introduction</strong>
As NASA scientists look to the stars to discover worlds beyond our own, some scientists in the medical field are looking in the opposite direction—inward to discover the world within our own bodies. The human microbiota is an expansive environment that is entirely contained by the human body, in locations like the skin, digestive, and reproductive tracts (1). The discovery of the human microbiota has consequently led to the belief that humans do not only contain 20,000 genes in our own DNA but also at least 100,000 more, contained in the microbiota (1). Because of the discovery of an entirely new genome, along with a new perspective on what constitutes health—researchers have speculated that human diseases can be mitigated or prevented by microbial intervention. However, certain disturbances in a stable gut microbiota population can contribute to GI issues as well. Depending on a person’s microbial profile, recent publications suggest that disturbances in this population can lead to dysbiosis, or the overgrowth of commensal bacteria that can produce toxins that induce oxidative stress and inflammation. This insult is then said to trigger associated immune responses that mediate sensitive genetic pathways that lead to GI tract diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (2).

Understanding the interactions between the human microbiota and GI medicine is important for the study of digestive diseases, like IBD. In order to further investigate this relationship, this literature review will discuss the characteristics of and differences between the microbiota of healthy individuals and those with IBD. Additionally, this paper will emphasize the need for advances in the treatment and management of IBD through research within the fields of microbiology and gastrointestinal medicine. Although there are many theories about the causes of this phenomenon, this discussion will also provide the context with which to evaluate the details of this disease.

<strong>Background</strong>
The human microbiota is primarily found on the skin and within the digestive and reproductive tracts. Although spread throughout the human body, the largest population of microbial symbionts are housed within the GI tract, where approximately 10-100 trillion microbes perform functions such as the metabolism of indigestible nutrients and xenobiotics, vitamin synthesis, gut epithelial cell turnover, and immune system regulation (1). The human gut microbiota is said to be a robust functioning ecosystem by the popular press, but it can also be subject to change through the influence of diet, drugs, and disease. Many studies allude to the idea that an imbalance of the gut microbiota, termed gut dysbiosis, is a key modulator in triggering different digestive system diseases, like IBD. According to recent literature, it is hypothesized that the mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis lie in the direct relationship between the effects of gut microbial dysbiosis and the intestinal immune system (3-7).

Inflammatory bowel disease is a cluster of disorders that encompasses both Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) due to their inflammatory effects on the large intestine. Currently, the main causes of the onset of IBD are not known, but it is speculated that it is triggered through a combination of genetic mutations, environmental factors, and the gut microbiota (8). Although Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are two separate inflammatory conditions, they both are thought to be intensified by a disruption in the relationship between the human digestive tract and the gut microbiome. This disruption or dysbiosis is said to indirectly promote inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system. There are currently a few separate processes that are said to contribute to dysbiosis-associated inflammation: environments that support pathogen overgrowth, oxygen availability, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism (8). Research within this field has identified these as the most promising reasons for the promotion of IBD-associated non-functioning microbiota. However, it is recommended that further investigations be done in order to elucidate the exact mechanism of pathogenesis.

<strong>Methods</strong>
In order to gain access to a multitude of scientific journals, the UC Davis Library VPN was used to explore the Google Scholar and PubMed academic databases. Using keywords and phrases such as “human gut microbiome,” “gut flora,” and “inflammatory bowel disease” helped narrow the search process. To maintain validity and relevance, references had to fall within a recent date range If an article was written prior to 2012, it was included only if its information was considered to be a hallmark study in the field.

<strong>The Human Gastrointestinal Tract Microbiota</strong>
Recently, the human microbiota has been implicated in many functions of the digestive system (1), therefore, it can no longer be ignored when studying the functions, processes, and diseases of the human GI tract. In order to investigate these implications, many scientists agree that the core functions of the microbiota must be established. With the onset of new genetic sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA and shotgun genome sequencing, many research groups were able to establish the major contributions that a healthy microbiota provides to their host. For example, The Human Genome Project (HGP) and Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract Project (MetaHIT) are worldwide initiatives whose mission is to investigate the impact of the microbiota on “human well-being” (1, 9). Analysis of millions of genome data sets from these projects found that the gut microbiota is primarily involved in two functions, “housekeeping” and host-specific processes (9). Housekeeping functions, such as regulating energy metabolism and DNA synthesis, were primarily found to be responsible for survival in the human GI tract. However, the host-specific gene functions were found to be related to bacterial adhesion to host cell-structures as well as the microbial breakdown of glycolipids (9). Within the host-specific functions found, there is a proposed “minimal metagenome” that contains a fraction of the roles that are commonly known within the scientific community to be vital for human digestion and GI tract health. In alignment with Qin et al.’s initial characterizations, many other research groups have continued to find that the minimal metagenome is involved with SCFA, amino acid, and vitamin synthesis, as well as the activation of T-cells and autophagy pathways (6, 9). This small subset of the metagenome and its associated functions are what have been proposed to be vital in the regulation of the human immune system, in addition to being involved in GI tract diseases (6).

The human gut microbiota is one of the many influential mediators of human GI tract functioning; however, when normal processes are disturbed, shifts in microbial metabolism and diversity can occur (3). The ecological balance of the microbiota of the GI tract is quite delicate. When it is subjected to any type of environmental stress, it can easily be shifted towards a distribution that promotes the overgrowth of commensal species that can be harmful in large populations. As the microbial environment becomes increasingly hostile, the human immune system will usually respond, causing the recruitment of immune system cells—thus promoting inflammation (4). In order to understand the processes behind the dysbiosis of a stressed microbiota, many research groups are using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the functional losses of IBD-associated microbial samples of either feces or intestine biopsy. For example, in 2012, an experiment investigating these effects found that the microbiota associated with IBD was strikingly different than that of healthy controls. Further analysis was able to show that dysbiosis caused increases in mucin degradation, cysteine synthesis, and the metabolism of riboflavin. The same data set also showed that dysbiosis also caused a drop in the production of SCFAs, which are an essential energy source for enterocytes (6). Similar results from other studies have also shown a characteristic decrease in SCFA production, which has been consistently hypothesized to contribute to intestinal inflammation (5-7).

<strong>Inflammatory Bowel Disease</strong>
When studying IBD, it is important to consider the onset and etiology of the disease. Although the causes are still classified as unknown, it has been speculated that IBD occurs as a result of a combination of genetic susceptibilities, environmental factors, immune system mechanisms, and gut dysbiosis (5). One major factor and common trend found in the investigation of the condition, is gut microbial dysbiosis, which has been found to be highly related to IBD in many studies (6, 7, 10). Furthermore, the shift in microbial diversity and function has been found to be different between the two divisions of IBD, Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (6, 7, 10). In the following sections, the gut microbiota profile of each disease will be discussed in order to examine how each profile contributes to the characteristic intestinal inflammation in IBD.

<em><strong>Crohn’s Disease</strong></em>
Crohn’s disease has taken the forefront in IBD-focused research. Historically, Crohn’s has been said to be connected to a combination of genetic susceptibility and microbial dysbiosis. In clinical settings, it is characterized by intestinal inflammation of multiple layers of the mucosa, which can occur at any part of the digestive tract. Complications of CD include bowel perforations, abscesses, malabsorption, and fistulae (11). Because of the potentially dangerous complications of CD, researchers have focused on investigating this disease alone. In an effort to elucidate the true method of pathogenesis of CD, Nagao-Kitamoto et al. used genetically modified IL-10 deficient mice in an attempt to replicate the genetic component of CD (2016). Through multivariate gene analysis and in vivo experiments, it has been confirmed that animal models barely show signs of developing CD, unless they are made to be genetically susceptible to it, as in the case of IL-10 deficiency (7).

Many researchers have also found that CD is consistently associated with the loss of specific species of bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausntzii and Rosburia hominis (6). It has been hypothesized that F. prausntzii has anti-inflammatory effects because they are consistently inversely correlated with levels of inflammation in the gut (10). It has also been suggested that the loss of these key bacterial species are associated with a decrease in SCFA production, and an increase in intestinal inflammation caused by enterocytes due to the lack of an energy source (6). In 2015, it was confirmed by scientists representing the American Journal of Gastroenterology that the typical microbial profile of a CD patient usually differs from that of a UC patient. In their analysis, they found that CD patients had unusually high numbers of gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium ramosum, and Eubacterium cylindroides, in addition to having the well-documented decrease in F. prausntzii (12). Overall, this bacterial phenotype has been said to be characterized by an increase in carbohydrate metabolism and a decrease in SCFA production, which has been shown to cause drastic changes in redox pathways (6). It is these changes in microbial functioning that are said to contribute to overall IBD pathogenesis, which will be discussed later.

<em><strong>Ulcerative Colitis</strong></em>
Ulcerative Colitis (UC) has remained the more elusive of the two subdivisions of IBD, likely due to the difficulty in identifying a strict origin. Like CD, it is characterized by the inflammation of the colon, which causes edema, mucosal susceptibility to pathogens, and epithelial ulceration (5). Recent literature has pointed to the hypothesis that UC is also caused or promoted by microbial dysbiosis in the gut (4), but its effects are only found in the large intestine (11). Clinical symptoms of UC include bloody diarrhea, “toxic megacolon”, and bowel perforations (11)—which follow in suit with the theory that UC-specific dysbiosis may cause an increase in mucosal permeability. This directly increases the possibility, “of bacterial translocation and endotoxemia” (4). Due to this correlation, it is believed that the onset of UC is likely caused by a severe shift in the intestinal microbiota.

There has been overwhelming support in the scientific community for the idea that UC is caused by microbial dysbiosis (3-7). Many studies have confirmed that UC also has a distinct microbial profile, which is hypothesized to contribute to the effects of the condition. Broad-spectrum genetic analysis has revealed that patients who have UC typically have an overgrowth of Escherichia coli, Akkermansia, and Desulfvibrio, in addition to phyla related to Clostridium difficile (4, 12). These commensal pathogens have been said to exist in environments that are high in oxygen, suggesting that UC-associated dysbiosis is related to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). To further this argument, it was found that these species have been known to use sulfur as a source of redox potential, thus promoting the production of ROS and host secretion of homocysteine, an inflammatory amino acid derivative from sulfur metabolism (4, 6). These pathogenic mechanisms are said to be major contributors to the inflammation caused by UC and are connected to overall microbiota-IBD related complications.

<strong>The Mechanisms behind the Gut Microbiota and Irritable Bowel Disease Pathogenesis</strong>
As previously stated, the scientific community has established that one of the primary mechanisms of IBD-pathogenesis lies behind microbial dysbiosis in the intestines. In this section, the following potential mechanisms will be evaluated across all references: changes in SCFA and sulfur metabolism.

<em><strong>Changes in Short-Chain Fatty Acid Metabolism</strong></em>
Many publications established that both CD and UC have microbial compositions that decrease SCFA production (6, 7, 10). This is caused by the decrease in genera like Faecalibacterium, likely induced by an overgrowth of other commensal bacteria. This genus is said to be among the group of gut microbiota that participates in the digestion of complex polysaccharides, such as mucin and N-acetyl glucosamine, producing SCFAs as a byproduct (6). SCFAs, like butyrate, then stimulate intestinal enterocyte turnover and can influence the host response to inflammatory cytokines, which is vital for the prevention of inflammation in the gut. The fact that SCFAs can mediate host response to inflammatory chemicals, is the foundation on which the theory about SCFAs exists. Through cell-culture and animal studies, it has been found that SCFAs function by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production like TNF-α and the NF-kB pathway, which are both instrumental in causing the widespread inflammation in all bodily tissues (13, 14).

<em><strong>Changes in Sulfur Metabolism</strong></em>
Some researchers also believe that increases in sulfur metabolism may be a factor in the onset of inflammation in IBD. As the IBD-associated microbial population shifts towards dysbiosis, some bacteria switch to using sulfur as a source of redox potential. In an article by Morgan et al., this phenomenon was observed (2012). The researchers hypothesized that the microbiota increased in metabolizing sulfur-containing amino acids in order to achieve either of the following: homocysteine conversion to methionine as a method of maintaining redox balance or using cysteine to convert to pyruvate for energy (6). This observation was also recorded in a few other studies as well (4, 5, 10). The mechanism by which this phenomenon causes inflammation likely stems from the idea that high sulfur metabolism creates hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct, which suppresses fermentation in the gut, thus creating a marked decrease in SCFA production (5). Because this occurrence was found in many studies, it is safe to say that sulfur-metabolism likely serves an important role in IBD pathogenesis.

<strong>Concluding Remarks</strong>
Overall, the comprehensive analysis of multiple sources point to the conclusion that the human gut microbiota is highly instrumental in mediating host responses to diseases. Results from the respective studies analyzed throughout this review show that gut microbial dysbiosis is likely a root cause of IBD. Additionally, it is important to mention that the proposed mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis were also found globally, rather than in a singular study. Because of the widespread nature of the results, future research on the proposed mechanisms of IBD should be promising. Further research on treatments for IBD should definitely consider the impact of the gut microbiota towards the onset of each of the diseases (CD and UC). Currently, there are a few studies investigating the use of probiotics and other anti-pro-inflammatory cytokine drugs for the treatment of IBD, with the ultimate goal of remission (12, 15). In addition to using these findings to propose new, high efficacy methods of treatment, further research needs to be done in order to confirm their effectiveness.

<strong>Author’s Note</strong>
I first became interested in this topic when I read a news article about a team of scientists that had successfully integrated what the article called “mini human brains” into mice. Although the idea seemed novel to me, after a little digging, I found that the technology that generates such mini organs — or organoids — has existed for more than a decade. This technology is nevertheless constantly evolving, and I believe it will continue to do so for years to come.

<strong>Abstract</strong>
Three-dimensional human brain organoids, cultures derived from stem cells to mimic organs, represent a promising avenue for future research. These organoid models allow for unparalleled investigation into human brains’ complex development and alterations in response to particular factors, and they overcome the problems associated with model organisms and two-dimensional models. There are currently several approaches for producing such organoids. Serum-free suspension culture (SFEBq) protocols rely upon the self-assembly of stem cells and may use either selective or non-selective differentiation methods. These protocols allow for the recapitulation of some features of cortical development. SpinΩ, a miniaturized spinning bioreactor, overcomes some of the challenges of SFEBq methods such as high cost, low throughput, and lack of consistency. By virtue of their spontaneous astrocyte dispersion, human cortical spheroids (hSCs) reflect robust synaptic activity in a way not seen in the other techniques. Neocortical organoids’ single self-organized structure and circumvention of an animal-derived gelatinous matrix act in their favor as a model. All of these techniques show potential for modeling the elaborateness of the human brain.

<strong>Keywords</strong>
Human brain organoids, stem cells, brain development, brain disorders

<strong>Introduction</strong>
The intricacies of the human brain make it a daunting organ for scientists looking to unravel its mysteries. Many turn to models to give them a glimpse into complex brain-related issues such as neurodevelopment, neurodegenerative disorders, and even virus exposure [1, 2]. However, using model organisms such as rodents presents clear drawbacks because of the stark differences between rodents and humans [1, 5]. Similarly, two-dimensional monolayer cultures fail to accurately mimic the three-dimensional structure of the brain [2, 5]. In response to such constraints, researchers have developed methods of producing human brain organoids, 3D culture systems made up of brain tissue. These organoids can be thought of as miniature organs derived from human stem cells, and their applications range from modeling the generation of cortical tissue to the effects of cocaine on the developing brain [1-5]. Ultimately, 3D organoids represent a promising field for uncovering the inner workings of the human brain.

<strong>SFEBq</strong>
In a serum-free suspension culture (SFEBq culture), dissociated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) spontaneously reaggregate and differentiate into neural cells. To allow for cortex growth beyond what would be seen in the first trimester, Kadoshima et al. optimized the SFEBq method. To do so, they developed a culture of hESCs in a medium containing Rho kinase inhibitor, which mediates reaggregation. Additionally, supplementing the medium with chemically defined lipid concentrate, the carbohydrate heparin, and a low concentration of Matrigel — an animal-derived gelatinous protein mixture — helped maintain cells from which the ventricular zone would eventually develop. This zone is a tissue layer that contains neural stem cells belonging to the central nervous system. The cells’ telencephalic differentiation could be enhanced by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) inhibitor and Wnt protein inhibitor, both of which affect the pathways through which cell fate is determined [3].

In Kadoshima et al.’s optimized culture, the cortical neuroepithelium (NE) — neural cells that have yet to differentiate — spontaneously polarized along the dorsocaudal-ventrorostral axis. This result was demonstrated by the expression in the NE of brain region-specific genes, as visualized through immunostaining. The NE also displayed a curving morphology along the axis as seen through live imaging and Rho kinase inhibitor treatment, which blocks the pathway that normally constricts this morphology. Kadoshima et al. used layer markers to reveal that the NE separated into three cortical neuronal zones in the later days of the culture. At this stage, they also observed through immunostaining that the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ), a cortical layer in the central nervous system, contained a population of Tbr2− Sox2+ Pax6+ progenitors [3].

What is notable about all of these results is that they elucidate the SFEBq-derived cells’ ability to recapitulate human cortical generation, also known as corticogenesis. Developing embryos display both axial polarity and rounding morphogenesis. The distinct zones seen in the SFEBq cultures mimicked the fetal neocortex during development even up to the second trimester. Furthermore, the Tbr2− Sox2+ Pax6+ progenitors are specific to humans and, before the development of this method, were notoriously difficult to locate and distinguish from other progenitors in the oSVZ. The three-dimensional context that Kadoshima et al.’s SFEBq culture provides is thus instrumental in overcoming this difficulty [3].

<strong>Cerebral organoids</strong>
Lancaster et al. utilize a modified SFEBq protocol to yield what they term cerebral organoids, a three-dimensional culture system that could arise from either hESCs or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) [1]. This modified protocol uses a nonselective differentiation method, instead of the cortex-specific differentiation culture of Kadoshima et al. [3]. To generate the cerebral organoids, Lancaster et al. first induced the differentiation of stem cells into neuroepithelial cells through carefully controlled chemical conditions. They thereafter maintained these cells in 3D culture and embedded them in drops of Matrigel. The Matrigel droplets were then spun in a bioreactor in order to increase their nutrient absorption, a process that led to the rapid development of cerebral organoids [1].

Lancaster et al. next carried out reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for several markers to test the pluripotency and neural identity of the organoids. As the organoids became more differentiated, unsurprisingly, the pluripotency markers were downregulated and the neural identity markers were upregulated. Subsequent RT-PCR for forebrain and hindbrain markers revealed that both were present in the tissue. Additionally, the hindbrain markers diminished over time, just as they would during normal human brain development. Lancaster et al. utilized immunohistochemical staining to visualize an abundance of brain regions from the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. They found that not only had these broad regions developed discretely, but that more refined regions and structures such as the choroid plexus and immature retina were also displayed [1].

Through staining and fluorescent live imaging, Lancaster et al. also observed that the dorsal cortical tissue organization and the radial glia’s morphology and mitotic behavior were reminiscent of what would be seen during human cortical development. Additionally, fluorescent live imaging revealed that the cortical neurons were able to exhibit neural activity as seen through spontaneous calcium spikes in individual cells [1]. Importantly, Lancaster et al. observed the unique distribution of human-specific progenitors within the oSZV just as Kadoshima et al. did using their own methodology [1, 3]. Thus they affirmed that their cerebral organoid model could capture cerebral cortical organization as would be seen in a human brain [1].

<strong>SpinΩ</strong>
Lancaster et al. pioneered the method of using a spinning bioreactor to support the growth of cerebral organoids that represent key features of the developing human brain [1]. However, the large size, maintenance cost, and lack of experimental suitability act as severe limitations to this technology [2]. Furthermore, because SFEBq methodology involves the intrinsic self-assembly of human stem cells, the resulting organoids are typically made up of an abundance of cell types found in the forebrain, hindbrain, and retina [1]. What this diversity of cell types means is that cell samples vary greatly, making quantitative analyses more difficult and reducing the applicability of such organoids. Additionally, though these methods have shown promise toward shedding light on the elusive oSVZ, their progenitor populations have been sparse and the oSVZ layer underdeveloped [2].

To address this range of problems, Qian et al. designed a miniaturized spinning bioreactor called SpinΩ. Unlike the researchers using SFEBq methods, Qian et al. treated hiPSCs with SMAD protein inhibitors in order to pre-pattern the cells to the fate of particular brain regions. They next embedded the cells in Matrigel for seven days, removed them from the Matrigel, and spun them in SpinΩ. Immunohistological analysis showed that the generated organoids were forebrain-specific and homogeneous. Using layer neuron markers, they also found that the forebrain organoids effectively represented both the organization of multiple progenitor zones — including the oSVZ layer — and all six neuronal subtypes that would be observed during human cortical development; transcriptome comparisons validated these findings [2].

Further assessment revealed that the cortical neurons were functional and mature, as measured through their postsynaptic current activity and hyperpolarizing responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid. Additionally, Qian et al. used electrophysiological recordings and immunohistological analysis to uncover that forebrain organoids contain a variety of neuronal and other subtypes just as would be found in developing human brains. They even applied the SpinΩ technique toward producing midbrain and hypothalamic organoids. Overall, SpinΩ’s lower cost, higher throughput, and better reproducibility make it an advantageous method for the generation of 3D organoids [2].

<strong>Human cortical spheroids</strong>
Human cortical spheroids (hSCs), derived from hiPSCs, are three-dimensional structures that resemble the cerebral cortex. Unlike the previous methods, this one does not involve cell plating, embedding in extracellular matrices, or culturing under complex conditions. To generate the hSCs, Paşca et al. grew hiPSC colonies on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts and then transferred them to low attachment plates. The floating colonies folded into spherical structures within hours and could thereafter be induced to differentiate using a bone morphogenetic protein inhibitor and TGF-β inhibitor. These structures were then moved to a serum-free medium containing fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) [4].

Paşca et al. used probes, markers, and flow cytometry to confirm that the hSCs contained neurons from both the deep and superficial cortical layers; their corticogenesis also resembled that of in vivo human development. Imaging and current-clamp recordings revealed that the neurons displayed spontaneous calcium spikes and action potentials, pointing to their functional maturation. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that these neurons could also exhibit spontaneous synaptic activity that is linked to postsynaptic neuronal spike firing. Additionally, by increasing the hSCs’ exposure time to FGF2 and EGF, Paşca et al. could bring about the generation of glial cells called astrocytes, which play a critical role in synapse formation and function [4].

Significantly, the other aforementioned organoid generation methodologies do not allow for the spontaneous dispersion of astrocytes. The generation and spatial closeness of the astrocytes in the hSCs likely contributed to the robust synaptic activity that Paşca et al. observed. This method’s simplicity and reproducibility work in its favor as a model. Its amenability to slice physiology techniques adds to its favorability, as these techniques can be used to study complex synaptic events [4].

<strong>Neocortical organoids</strong>
Matrigel provides a platform for extracellular scaffolding and plays an instrumental role in the 3D culture systems developed by both Lancaster et al. and Qian et al [1, 2]. The use of this animal-derived gelatinous matrix, however, may introduce undefined animal factors and disrupt the delivery of drugs and other compounds into the generated organoids. While Paşca et al. avoid using Matrigel, their hSCs contain ventricular zone regions that vary in size and number, thus limiting their reproducibility and cell architecture quantification. In response to these challenges, Lee et al. developed a technique to produce what they call neocortical organoids from either hESCs or hiPSCs. These organoids, as their name implies, emulate the developing human neocortex [5].

To generate the neocortical organoids, Lee et al. cultured human stem cell colonies using irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cells. After a period of growth in adherent culture, the researchers manually dissected rosettes — round groupings of cells — of a certain size and primed them in suspended culture. From this culture arose self-organized neocortical organoids. Treating the stem cells with combined dual SMAD and FGF inhibitors allowed for the generation of NE rosettes of an appropriate size for organoid development. The differentiation of these NE rosettes mimicked that of the human fetal brain by the middle of the second trimester, and astrocyte generation could be observed in the organoids. Additionally, whole-cell electrophysiological recording demonstrated the functional activity of the neocortical neurons [5].

What makes this model advantageous compared to the others is its avoidance of Matrigel and its production of a single self-organized neocortex-like structure. The former makes neocortical organoids an attractive option for quantitative pharmacological purposes, and the latter increases the organoids’ reproducibility by allowing for the generation of a predictable number and size of NE rosettes. Since the organoids effectively capture several important features of human cortical development, they could potentially act as a platform for further investigation of such development [5].

<strong>Applications</strong>
With the techniques behind each method outlined thusly, their various applications may now be explored. Kadoshima et al.’s SFEBq system lends itself well to investigation into early human corticogenesis. Future applications may include studying the formation of human cortical interneurons, the involved separation of cortical zones, and the mechanism of cortical NE growth [3]. Lancaster et al. focused on microcephaly as a worthwhile avenue to pursue using their cerebral organoids; experiments using organoids derived from a patient with microcephaly revealed that these organoids could provide some insight into the pathogenesis of this neurodevelopmental disorder [1].

Qian et al. utilized their forebrain organoid generated from SpinΩ as a model for Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. Their results brought to light that ZIKV targets neural precursor cells and leads to deficits in cortical development [2]. The hSCs of Paşca et al. act as a promising platform for research into the patterning and specification of different neuronal and glial cell types, the screening of drugs in vitro, and the study of neuropsychiatric disorders [4]. Finally, Lee et al. applied their neocortical organoids toward elucidating the pathways through which cocaine affects human brain development. Other applications of neocortical organoids include uncovering the negative effects of psychostimulants, as well as modeling neurodevelopmental disorders that are found only in humans, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia [5].

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Three-dimensional human brain organoids allow for modeling of the complexities of the human brain in a way that model organisms and two-dimensional models do not. Several methodologies for producing these organoids are currently available, termed SFEBq, cerebral organoids, SpinΩ, hSCs, and neocortical organoids. Each methodology has distinct assets and drawbacks, but all of them provide crucial insight into the human brain. Already some of their applications have been explored, ranging from studying human corticogenesis to delving into neurodevelopmental disorders to examining cocaine’s effects on the brain. Future avenues for research using these methods are abundant and include illuminating how NE thickness is controlled, how glial cells become patterned, and how pharmaceutical agents adversely affect humans. Through the use of 3D organoid models, researchers may find themselves one step closer to unlocking the secrets of the human brain.

<b>Author’s Note: </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I am currently studying the signaling of Protein Kinase D in cardiomyocytes as a part of my senior thesis research project. Writing this review helped me understand the known mechanisms and the techniques used to perform functional assessments of the molecule. I learned how to review literature to find key information and create a story from different sources. I hope that the reader will become interested in one of the major concepts of my review and will continue exploring it on their own time. </span>

<b>Background</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clinical Presentation of Heart Failure</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400">Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death in the U.S. population (American Heart Association). HF is defined by structural and functional impairments of the heart muscle that may be caused by chronic neurohormonal stimulation [1]. A common precursors to HF is cardiac hypertrophy, which is characterized by increased cell size, reorganization of sarcomere structure, and reactivation of fetal genes--all contributing to pathogenic cardiac remodeling [2]. Although many treatments exist, this condition is associated with poor prognosis, low quality of life and frequent hospital readmissions [3]. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and Its Involvement in HF</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Low cardiac output is an early sign of heart failure that triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as a compensatory mechanism to increase the fluid volume. Although the cardiac output is temporarily increased, chronic angiotensin II and aldosterone as well as sympathetic nervous system stimulation eventually result in fluid overload. This paradox contributes to accumulation of damage to the cardiovascular system, which may ultimately result in myocardial ischemia, hypertrophy, and arrhythmia [4]. The RAAS is a key regulator in the cardiovascular system and its role in conditions such as hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and atherosclerosis is well established. Components of the RAAS are known biomarkers of HF and are targeted therapeutically with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin, mineralocorticoid, and aldosterone receptor antagonists [4].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The RAAS is a major endocrine-paracrine system that regulates vasoconstriction (via angiotensin II) and salt-water balance (via aldosterone). The activation cascade is initiated with renin, an enzyme produced in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney in response to decreased systemic volume and low renal perfusion pressure. Angiotensinogen is a precursor produced in the liver and is cleaved by renin to form angiotensin I. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves angiotensin I into angiotensin II, promoting the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal gland. Angiotensin II is locally produced in the heart, which may exacerbate heart failure symptoms in patients with activated RAAS [5]. Aldosterone increases the permeability of the kidney to sodium, thereby increasing retention of salt and water in the body. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>The Role of Protein Kinase D in Modulating the RAAS and HF </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Several studies have recently suggested a role for Protein Kinase D (PKD), a regulator of cardiac hypertrophy, in modulating the RAAS. PKD is a stress responsive kinase that belongs to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKII) superfamily. CaMKIIs play a role in calcium handling and excitation-contraction coupling in the cardiomyocytes. There are 3 known isoforms of PKD, of which PKD1 is most highly expressed in the heart [6][7][8]. PKD affects a wide array of cellular processes including contractility, survival, proliferation and differentiation, actin dynamics, substrate utilization and gene transcription. PKD1 has also been linked to pathological cardiac remodeling, immune regulation, angiogenesis and cancer [9][10]. </span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Role of PKD1 in Heart Failure</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There has been growing evidence of PKD1’s involvement in heart failure. Harrison et al. identified that suppression of PKD1 activity in cardiomyocytes results in a decrease of hypertrophic responses such as reduction in cell size and expression of fetal markers, while constitutive expression exhibits ventricular chamber dilation, wall thinning, and enlargement of the atria. PKD1 phosphorylation has been observed in response to pressure overload, consistent with the cardiac hypertrophy model. Additional evidence from the same study suggests that mice with cardiac-specific PKD1 knockout (cPKD1 KO) are resistant to hypertrophy and fibrosis after induced thoracic aortic constriction, which involves surgical occlusion of the aorta to induce HF [11]. PKD1 expression is upregulated in rabbit HF and in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. PKD1 may be interacting with nuclear-localized class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) that regulate re-expression of fetal genes leading to hypertrophy [12][13][14]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Under stress the heart alters its metabolism leading to increased utilization of carbohydrate substrates, similar to conditions before birth. After birth, the heart takes on the adult isoform, primarily utilizing energy from fatty acid oxidation. To meet the demands of hypertrophy conditions, alternative metabolism genes, also known as fetal genes, become expressed ultimately leading to cardiac remodeling or reversion to a fetal state.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Point to PRKD1 as a Potential HF Marker</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Genome-wide association studies look at correlations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or mutations and disease. A recent study pointed to SNPs in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">PRKD1</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, PKD1 gene,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">that are associated with elevated BMI and obesity. Further studies confirmed truncations in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">PRKD1</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in patients with autosomal recessive truncus arteriosus, a congenital heart condition where the aorta and pulmonary artery are fused disrupting the appropriate blood flow. Spontaneous deletions in the gene are also associated with abnormal cardiac physiology [15]. Patients harboring nonsense mutations in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">PRKD1 </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">are also linked to congenital heart defects [16]. These findings are not surprising since </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">PRKD1</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">-/-</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> results in embryonic lethality [11], suggesting that mutations in the gene may result in aberrant cardiac development. </span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Angiotensin II-mediated Activation of PKD1 </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Angiotensin II activates PKD1 through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) residing on the cell’s membrane, which allows it to interact with downstream cardiac ion channels [17]. Prolonged stimulation with angiotensin II may result in hypertrophy. Cardiac-specific PKD1 knockout prevented hypertrophy after treatment with angiotensin II [11]. PKD1 is also known to assemble with Protein Kinase C (PKC) and translocate the Z-disks of the cardiac sarcomeres in response to angiotensin II. Z-disk protein assembly comprises a sarcomere unit that is crucial for the structure maintenance, signal transduction [18][19], and is likely involved in transmitting pro hypertrophic signals [23]. </span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Aldosterone effects on PKD1 </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Chronic exposure to aldosterone is associated with cardiac fibrosis (Brilla et al.). PKD1 is activated by aldosterone in mice, while treatment with aldosterone inhibitors prevents hypertrophy, pointing to the its involvement in profibrotic responses [20]. Additional studies demonstrate aldosterone-mediated PKD1 activation through mineralcoid receptors in the kidney [21]. and angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion through constitutively active PKD1 signaling in adrenal cells [22]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the recent advancements in cardiovascular medicine, novel molecular targets are necessary to precisely treat the underlying causes of HF. Although PKD seems to be heavily involved in HF, there are currently no direct treatments that target this kinase. Further studies of PKD activity in the heart may uncover new therapeutic targets that could be better alternatives to conventional RAAS inhibitors. While PKD has been an actively researched molecule, its precise activity in different subcellular compartments and pathogenic signaling remains to be fully understood. Future studies may pave the way for further development of anti-fibrotic and hypertrophic treatments that inhibit the angiotensin II-aldosterone dynamics.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Brooke B., Neurology, Physiology, and Behavior, ‘22</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> I heard about this device on the news, and I was immediately intrigued by the concept. I decided to research it further, upon which I was surprised how logical and efficient the device worked with such substantial results. I wanted to share what I believe to be a huge breakthrough in cancer research.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">A new 3D printed drug-absorption device can now filter excess drugs out of the bloodstream, eliminating the notorious toxicity of chemotherapy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">By estimation, 50-80% of the drugs deployed in a chemotherapy session miss the target tumor. The side effects of chemotherapy, such as hair loss, fatigue, and nausea result from the drug entering circulation and killing non-cancerous cells. While higher drug dosage linearly increases tumor cell death, the body can only sustain so many therapies within a period of time because of this severe, mistargeted toxicity. Thus treatment is stunted, but a sponge that prevents the toxicity associated with large dosage can broaden the capability of chemotherapies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Nitash Balsara, an engineer working with the researchers, explained that an absorber is not a new concept in the world of chemical engineering. Used to refine petroleum of unwanted chemicals, such as sulfur, the team has simply applied the absorber concept to chemotherapy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The sponge is first inserted into the vein that drains the dosed organ. A minimally invasive surgery threads wire through a central hole in the sponge’s design and guides the device to the intended vein. Surrounding the central hole is a porous square lattice, coated in a polymer solution that binds with doxorubicin, a common drug used to kill cancerous cells. In place, pores in the device extract the pollutants from the drugged blood before the device is removed from the vein.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Experiments reported by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ACS Central Science </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">in January of 2019 tested the device on pigs undergoing a 10 minute infusion with a 50mg dose of doxorubicin to the common iliac vein, resembling a typical chemo treatment to the liver. To monitor the effectiveness of the device, a catheter was placed between the injection site and the sponge, and another one after the sponge. One experiment yielded a 69% reduction in doxorubicin, which was confirmed by plasma centrifugation. Repeated trials produced an efficiency range from 57% to 69%, without producing any blood clots or biocompatibility disruptions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The efficiency of this process is highly dependent on a sponge’s prewash in polymer solution. A blank 3D printed device is soaked and dried in a solution that contains polystyrene sulfonate chains. These chains bind rapidly with doxorubicin, removing the drug from circulation. Attempts to “wring” the sponges of the doxorubicin proved negligible, however; the devices were determined to have bound with the drug irreversibly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The experiments confirmed the device to be the first of its kind to bind with drugs in the bloodstream, said Steven Hetts, UC San Francisco radiologist and pioneer of the research. He wants to move the project in the direction of in-human studies for practical tests and eventual FDA approval on patients who critically need the device. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Hetts believes this device can be used for any approach to drug treatment, potentially even for drugs beyond the scope of chemotherapies. Strong antibiotics, for example, leave byproducts in the system that can be eliminated by the same device. The application is a simple but powerful one: by making high dosage without the toxic side-effects possible, the drug sponge has become a strong future for cancer treatments.</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I wrote this literature review for my UWP 104F class, and I specifically chose this topic because obesity is a very stigmatized disorder or “disease” (as the AAMC recently labeled it). I wanted to explore the link to genetics and to see how thoroughly we understand the underlying causes of obesity, specifically in children. Further, the judgement of both the children and the children’s parents has brought up a conversation about whether or not it is okay to place a child into foster care for treatment of obesity, due to lack of care by the parents. Initially, research into foster care seemed out of place in this paper. However, I think it’s an interesting way to combine the scientific advancements outlined in this review paper with the social contentions surrounding obesity. I hope the reader will come away with a more thorough understanding of the complexity of the disease based on the link to genetics.</span>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Pediatric obesity is a serious disease affecting American children and adolescents.  According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), one in every six children is affected by pediatric obesity. The CDC defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) in the 95</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> percentile of children with the same age and sex, while morbid pediatric obesity is considered as having a BMI in the 99</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> percentile.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Various causes of obesity have been identified, including environmental factors such as diet, level of sedentary lifestyle, and parental BMI. Recently, genetic links to pediatric obesity have been identified and studied. Many genes, including portions of the FTO gene (fat mass and obesity-associated) and 3q29 (a section of DNA on chromosome 3), have been shown to be strongly linked.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3,4</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Other genes, which were believed to be linked to appetite, have been shown to have no causation with obesity. It is interesting to consider this data in the context of foster care. New studies gathering data from a large sample size of adolescents in foster care have interesting findings. Consideration of this data is important in the discussion of whether or not foster care is an effective treatment option for pediatric obesity. While foster care is not a conventional treatment for obesity, it can be considered in cases where parents are showing neglect. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This review will outline various findings concerning the link between pediatric obesity and genetics. This involves examining studies which suggest a link between genetics and obesity, and also studies which show no causation for a certain gene. Further investigations will be done on publications which outline the changes in BMI after children have entered foster care and the implications of these findings on the causes of pediatric obesity.</span>

<b>Genetic Links</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">FTO and MC4R</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Throughout the past five years, many studies have shown strong genetic links to pediatric obesity. One of these genes is the fat mass and obesity-associated gene, or FTO gene. In one previous publication, researchers utilized a cross-sectional study of over 16,000 children to search for a statistical association between FTO variant rs9939609, total macronutrient intake, and the subsequent effect on BMI.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> They found that this particular FTO variant is predictive of both a high BMI and an associated higher nutrient intake.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400">  The FTO gene codes for fat mass and obesity-associated protein, which is important in breaking down dietary fats.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Another research group had a similar question about the FTO gene and variant rs9939609, except they approached the data analysis differently. Rather than looking at whether or not genetic variations modified fat intake, they examined whether or not an increase in macronutrient intake increased the gene’s expression.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Their findings show that a higher fat intake of an individual increased the activity of the FTO variant.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The gene expresses itself in a positive feedback manner because the FTO variant rs993609 is predictive of a higher BMI and higher nutrient intake. Further, higher macronutrient intake leads to a higher expression of this variant. This variant has a correlation with and effect on pediatric obesity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Another closely related study looked at the ability of carriers of the FTO GG (a certain genotype of the FTO gene) and/or MC4R CC (melanocortin 4 receptor) gene to lose weight. In order to examine this, researchers screened a large population of obese children and studied those with varying levels of the protein Lp-PLA2, which is the product of FTO GG and/or MC4R CC.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Obese carriers of these genes were statistically able to lose significantly more weight than non-carriers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Certain variants of the FTO gene are associated with weight loss, while others are associated with a higher BMI and a higher fat intake. Both indicate a link between pediatric obesity and genetic factors.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Prader-Willi Syndrome and MO1 Syndrome</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Other genetic variants include copy number variants of 3q29 and syndromic, where the patient is showing symptoms (15q11.2 deletions, Prader-Willi syndrome) and non-syndromic (16p11.2 deletion).</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5.6</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> A copy number variant is when a portion of the genome is repeated at a different rate than the rest of the population, thus leading to a different number of repeats in the genome of the variant. Prader-Willi syndrome and a deletion of 16p11.2 have been shown to be linked to pediatric obesity, although they are rare deletions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Researchers were wondering how significant the relation between rare copy number variants and  pediatric obesity was, so they genetically tested a group of pediatric obese patients versus healthy-weight pediatric patients.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> They found many copy number variants in the obese subject group and concluded that copy number variants statistically contribute to a substantial amount of pediatric obesity cases.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Other researchers investigated an Arab-Israeli family living in northern Israel. In the family there were 15 obese patients with 31 unaffected, relatively healthy family members. Despite growing up in a very similar environment, with comparable diets and exercise levels, 33% of the family faced obesity with associated glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia (elevated fats and cholesterol in the blood), and insulin resistance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> While this was not a specific study on pediatric obesity, all affected family members developed childhood obesity by age 3.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The researchers genetically screened every member of the family and found that all affected by obesity were missing the gene coding for CEP19.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> They verified these results with knockout mice for the same gene. The mice were found to be morbidly obese, glucose intolerant, and insulin resistant, and they also had  a notably increased appetite.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> A wide variety of genetic variations, including mutations, deletions, or insertions, can contribute to the spread of pediatric obesity. Many genes have been investigated and are thought to affect obesity; however, it is important to discuss studies that show no correlations between genetics and obesity.  </span>

<b>Genetics with no causation</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While there are many genes which are now thought to be connected to obesity, many have been thoroughly studied and shown to have little relation to obesity. Certain genes which have been linked to appetite were studied to find a link to higher BMI. Genes which code for proteins called Neuropeptide Y and Neuropeptide receptor 2 (NPY and NPY2R, respectively) have been shown to have a positive effect on the appetite of an individual. Since there was a connection to appetite, researchers hypothesized that it may further have an effect on obesity. Adolescents with varying BMIs up to age 14 were screened for overexpression of the previously-mentioned genes and also for genetic variations. This study found no significant variants of NPY2R and some minor variants of NPY, but both these genes were overall found to have no significant contribution to the obese population.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">7</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> It is notable to discuss that genes linked to appetite can still be secondarily linked to obesity, even if their expressions can’t be linked to BMI directly. Another study screened for variants of the SH2B1 gene, a gene which codes for a protein which interacts with insulin receptors. The study was broad, and included a large percentage of the Belgian adolescent population. While many variants of the gene were found between healthy and obese subjects, no causation was identified between variants and obesity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">8</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Researchers do conclude that while causation cannot be statistically verified, it can also not be entirely ruled out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">8</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> In another study on adult Americans, researchers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">did</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> find a link between SH2B1 and obesity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">11</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> A notable difference between the studies was the age. In Belgium, researchers looked at only adolescents, while the study in America looked only at adults. The juxtaposition of these findings highlight how far we are from a full understanding of this disease and its various causes.</span>

<b>Foster Care</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that we have examined the link between genetics and obesity, we will examine data connecting foster care and obesity. This is interesting data to analyze for multiple reasons. </span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Foster care as a treatment for pediatric obesity is currently a heavily-debated, controversial topic. Furthermore, foster care is a dramatic change in a child’s environment. Because of this, we can analyze this data in the context of genetic factors versus environmental factors having an effect on obesity. </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There is currently some debate among experts about whether or not foster care is an appropriate option for children who suffer from pediatric obesity, particularly those with morbid obesity. This stems from the idea that parents of obese children do not provide sufficient care by either over-feeding their children or not providing regular, healthy meals. Case studies, where an obese or morbidly obese child is placed into foster care and their weight is studied, are common in this field. A recent study mapped the weight fluctuations of 360 children who were placed into foster care. In children aged 2-5 years, there was a significantly lowered BMI after entering into foster care. However, no significant total change was found across all ages.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">9</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Another similar study compared the BMIs of foster children to standardized normal BMIs in the general population. It was found that children in foster care were more likely to have a higher BMI than children who were not in foster care.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">10</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Foster care has positive and negative effects on each individual child. However, in evaluating a large sample size of children within the foster care system, foster care may not be helpful in treating pediatric obesity and could potentially be contributing to the prevalence of the disease. These findings qualify the previous discussion on pediatric obesity and genetics, as altering a child’s environment does not appear to reduce their BMI and may even lead to an increase in BMI. </span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While pediatric obesity can have many causes, recent studies have shown a link between genetics and this disease. These findings are particularly interesting in the context of discussing foster care as a treatment option for pediatric obesity. Data suggests that changing a child’s environment by placing them into foster care may have little beneficial effects on pediatric obesity and can even contribute to the disease. Physicians’ current treatment plans for obesity involve recommending lifestyle changes; however, environmental changes will not alter phenotypic effects. With an understanding of the underlying genetic causation, further research could be done on the efficacy of treatment plans for pediatric obesity. Re-evaluation of current treatment plans for pediatric obesity appears important, considering the recent findings about various causes of pediatric obesity.</span>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">While working on a different paper, I became interested in treatment and therapy for drug addiction. Addiction continues to increase, yet there seem to be limited viable options to actually overcome this problem. One of the main issues in the recovery process is relapses. I found this study interesting and promising for drug therapy because it directly targets relapses, an important step in preventing and treating drug addiction more effectively.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">In order to reduce the rate of addiction, scientists are trying to figure out how to prevent relapses after an individual has decided to stop using a specific drug. One of the major factors in preventing relapses is breaking detrimental environmental connections that may trigger an individual to start using a certain drug again. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A study by Torregrossa at the University Pittsburgh School of Medicine identified the brain circuit involved in cue-associated memories. They were able to establish that synaptic connections between the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and the lateral amygdala (LA) were strengthened with increased cocaine usage (3). Furthermore, they found that by weakening the synaptic connections in the MGN-LA circuit, they were able to erase the cocaine-cue memories and in turn help reduce relapses. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The MGN is a group of subnuclei located in the thalamus that receive auditory input, which it then conveys to the auditory cortex (4). The LA is an important component to conditioning experiments, like Torregrossa’s experiment. Though the LA is usually associated with experiments that use fear-inducing stimuli, Torregrossa uses a more desirable incentive: the cocaine high. It also believed that the LA is a key site of plasticity, which means it establishes long-lasting changes while learning these cues and also helps store cue-associated memories (6). Based on these findings, Torregrossa developed an experiment that reflected the role of both the MGN and the LA in the circuit to test whether the link between a cue and a certain situation could be altered. She used the scope of drug addiction to see if relapses triggered by cue-associated memories could be prevented by erasing the link between the cue and memory. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The researchers placed the rats in a cage with a lever, which connected to a pump that intravenously dispensed a dose of cocaine into the rat’s bloodstream. Every time the rat pressed the lever, it was given a dose of cocaine, which was accompanied by a bright light and a ringing noise for ten seconds (7). The goal was to establish an audiovisual cue with the high felt from cocaine. By creating this connection, Torregrossa would be able to simply play the audiovisual cue and stimulate a craving for the cocaine high, even when no cocaine was being dispensed from the lever. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The creation of the audiovisual cue strengthened the synaptic connections in the MGN-LA circuit, establishing a starting point for Torregrossa to determine whether these strengthened connections could be diminished or altered in some form. The goal of the experiment was to weaken these connections in order to break the linkage between the established audiovisual cue and the cocaine high. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In order to weaken the connections, Torregrossa used optogenetics, a technique to introduce light-sensitive genes into targeted brain cells in order to control brain activity using light signals (8). Optogenetics essentially introduces genetically modified neurons, achieved through the insertion of light-sensitive proteins into the targeted neurons, which create ion channels among the genetically modified neurons. Through the use of a specific type of light, for this experiment - blue LED laser light, researchers are able to stimulate the light-sensitive ion channels on command (8). This techniques have been utilized in previous experiments with mice where researchers were able to stop epileptic seizures or induce thirst on command (7). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Light stimulation must take place in the region, which is activated when new memories are made (2). Furthermore, Torregrossa et al. observed that the memory of the cocaine high as a result of the audiovisual cue led to heightened activity in the rat’s amygdala, which is located in the medial temporal lobe and is crucial in processing emotions such as fear and pleasure (1). As a result, Torregrossa identified the amygdala to be a key site in weakening the connection between the cue and the high. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">She determined that the sensory intersection in the amygdala would be the ideal site to place the electrode, given that it is directly associated with the cue-triggered memories. The electrode inserts light-sensitive proteins into the targeted neurons. Therefore, these electrodes enable the blue LED laser light to control the neurons (3). For this experiment, the light can dampen the drug cue. After using the light stimulation for fifteen minutes, they conducted a test to determine any changes in the strength of the synaptic connections. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">By reducing the extent of the drug cue, the mice essentially forgot the link between the audiovisual cue and the cocaine high (7). In addition to the optogenetics method, Torregrossa initially used exposure therapies. The goal of exposure therapy is in line with Torregrossa’s intent to break the link between the cue and source of addiction. However, exposure therapy involves exposing the mice to the audiovisual cue without the cocaine high a significant number of times, so they in turn do not associate the cue with the high. While this method may be temporarily effective, once the environment changes, researchers have observed that the connection between the cue and source of addiction returns (3). While both exposure therapy and the optogenetics method were successful in reducing relapses, the optogenetic method was more effective in terms of accuracy and long-term results (3).  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The possibility of erasing cue-associated memories has the potential to help prevent relapses and improve therapy and treatment for addiction. By establishing the amygdala as a key site of where these connections are produced, researchers will be able to conduct further studies looking at what other parts of the brain are involved in the creation of these memories. Furthermore, the success of optogenetics in this experiment suggests that optogenetics may be a viable option in the future to break these cue-associated memories </span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> essentially erasing memories (7). The ethics behind being able to erase these associations and in turn a memory is still vague. As more research is done on the MGN-LA circuits, researchers will be able to improve addiction therapy and also establish ethical rules in order to ensure that these new findings are used in a morally sound manner. </span>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrote this literature review for my UWP 104F class in my fourth year at UC Davis. My goal is to become a physical therapist and one of the most common complaints I hear from older generations is that they cannot perform activities they once loved because of a ‘bad back.’ My father experienced a disc related injury, which led to sciatica, after he fell off a ladder. This prevents him from enjoying activities such as heavy-lifting, riding roller coasters or picking up his grandson. For these reasons, I was interested in researching effective prevention and treatments to help alleviate discomfort and improve quality of life.</span>

<!--more-->

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A disc herniation is one of the most common injuries leading to chronic low back pain and disability. At some point in their lives, approximately 84% of adults experience low back pain, causing this to be a significant universal healthcare concern [1]. A herniated disc is a problem in which the nucleus pulposus or annulus fibrosis of intervertebral discs are pushed out beyond allowable disc space [2]. Herniation may produce an agonizing condition known as sciatica, radicular pain throughout the sciatic nerve [3]. The resulting chronic pain can become debilitating and a socioeconomic difficulty correlative to discomfort severity, necessary treatment and psychological or social consequences. According to Andersson et al., as cited by Khan et al., “The direct and indirect costs associated with LBP in the United States are estimated to be upwards of $100–200 billion per year, more than half of which is due to loss of income and lack of productivity” [1]. These disabling symptoms which threaten the quality of life, call for more effective treatments and therapies to alleviate pain and prevent the condition from progressing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Healthcare providers often suggest surgery, such as discectomy, to treat the cause of intractable pain. However, surgeries cannot completely cure the disability and the positive outcomes experienced by expensive and risky surgeries may only be temporary [4]. There are alternative treatments that may alleviate symptoms, such as exercise therapies and epidural steroid injections. Advantages of nonsurgical treatments include long-lasting benefits for some patients without the risk of potential damage to nerves, less postoperative pain, and decreased time away from work [5].</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Although there are some negative outcomes, there is significant research on various surgical treatments and the short-term effects. However, research comparing the long term efficaciousness of nonsurgical options to surgery is negligible. This could partly be due to the difficulty of conducting a valid study where human nature is concerned. Patients assigned to stretching, exercise and pain medication, are less likely to remain compliant, and at any point during the study they may request surgery.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> The purpose of this literature review is to analyze a variety of research studies regarding  treatments, and discuss the long term outcomes. This review additionally examines and contrasts nonsurgical and surgical intervention, with the goal of discovering and emphasizing the need for alternative care for symptom relief.</span>

<b>Results/Analysis</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anatomy and Potential Causes </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The spine is composed of intervertebral discs which are made of soft connective tissue, and function in shock absorbing, spinal flexibility and providing rigidity to the skeleton while allowing limited rotation and bending [1,6]. The center of an intervertebral disc consists of the nucleus pulposus, which is a gelatinous core, and the outer annulus fibrosis, which maintains disc structure [6,7]. Herniated discs can be caused by repetitive overuse, age related deterioration of discs, or a traumatic injury [6]. Degenerative changes occur with age as the discs dry out and crack with overuse and repeated irritation [1]. Studies have shown that most herniations occur when there is a rotational or compressive force applied while the back is in an anterolateral flexion position, resulting in bulging and slippage of the nucleus pulposus in the posterolateral direction [6]. This means that there is strain on the annulus fibrosis and pressure on the nucleus pulposus as it moves in the opposite direction of bend. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sciatica becomes a symptom of disc herniation once extrusion of the disc exerts force on the sciatic nerve roots [3]. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Physical Activity vs. Surgery</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Physical therapy programs encompass trunk and core strengthening, improved lumbosacral flexibility and low impact aerobic activity [7,8]. These methods increase stability and alleviate tension on the spine, thereby resulting in less pain or risk of long term disability [7]. Elnaggar et al. evaluated the efficiency of spinal flexion and extension exercises by instructing participants to perform these movements each day [9]. Researchers concluded that extension exercise was the most effective in reducing pain but that these differences could be attributed to variables such as patient age and initial severity of pain [9]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Daily living requires an extensive range of motions such as rotation and side bending, so the addition of a yoga program may have long-term beneficial effects. In a study by Tilbrook et al., individuals with low back pain were introduced to a yoga program that taught pain-relieving pose</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s to strengthen weak areas of the body [10]. Although the participants did not report any pain reduction, they did enjoy an improved ability to perform everyday activities [10]. Takaki et al. discussed the importance of posture attention during exercises [11]. If a patient had excessive tilting of the pelvis, this may promote extension of the lower back, leading to compression of the vertebrae [11]. To correct their posture, strengthening the abdominal muscles assisted in tilting the pelvis posteriorly, consequently reducing lower back pain [11]. Emphasizing awareness of posture may lessen stress on the spine and prevent further injury.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Surgical interventions are often used when there are continuous nerve root symptoms [12]. Of the various surgical options, discectomy is the “most frequent lumbar spine operation in the US,” involving removal of the disc that is pressing on the nerve root [13]. One study treated patients suffering from sciatica resulting from disc herniation with surgery or nonsurgical methods [13]. A ten-year follow up found that the magnitude of improvement in leg pain for surgically treated patients was greater than that of the nonsurgically treated, however, there was no difference in improvement in disability between the two groups [13].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> In research conducted by Weinstein et al., </span><span style="font-weight: 400">self-reported measurements of pain and physical function scales were utilized to compare the effectiveness of surgery to non-surgical interventions for patients with lumbar disk herniation [14]. Participants underwent surgery, or received non surgical treatment, such as physical therapy, education and counseling, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotic analgesic agents, or epidural injections. While both groups reported improvement in physical function and pain at three months, the surgical patients had more immediate and greater pain relief. Between three months and two years, the pain relief in the non surgical group was close to that of the patients receiving surgery. However, it appears that the patients who chose surgical intervention reported greater overall improvement than those who elected nonoperative care [14].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In an additional comparison of the two treatment options, the SPORT research trial, also concluded that early surgery may have a major advantage in faster relief of pain, quicker recovery, and return to work [14]. For those who are not surgical candidates, the alternative methods of care prove to be almost as effective as surgery following one year of treatment [14]. Long-term physical therapy and exercise are associated with decreased need for sick leave and a higher rate of return to work [8]. The results suggest that participants who utilize physical activity find their pain more manageable [14]. Findings by Weinstein et al. regarding patient reported satisfaction of surgical versus non surgical intervention appear contradictory [14]. On closer examination, Weinstein’s use of the word, manageable, with regard to the non surgical group, implies that this group benefited by learning coping mechanisms thereby leading to a more favorable perception of their pain level. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Epidural Injections vs Surgery</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Epidural steroid injection is another viable option for controlling back pain due to disc herniation. Although it is one of the most popular and minimally invasive treatments, there is mixed research as to its efficacy. In a study by Manchikanti et al., 120 patients diagnosed with disc herniation or radiculitis, a nerve root disease, either received epidural injections with a local anesthetic or steroid [15]. The steroid injected patients report of superior pain relief  demonstrates that steroids, in contrast to local anesthetics, have greater results in pain reduction [15]. The authors in Winkelstein et al. discuss increased interest in epidural administration of immunosuppressants, the results of which point to an inflammatory response [16].These findings regarding the role of inflammation and immune response in triggering pain are a promising option for future research.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A three-year study, by</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Buttermann, sought to compare the use of epidural steroid injection vs surgery for the relief of herniated disc pain [4]. The results showed a decrease in pain and an increase in function in both groups, but 31% of the epidurals had little success [4]. In conclusion, compared to  epidural steroid injection, discectomy is more effective in reducing symptoms and disability [4].</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Future Interventions</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Stem cell research towards regeneration of intervertebral discs is an exciting addition to an area of healthcare that has, as yet, seen little progress towards a permanent solution. The ability of a tissue to respond to stress or injury requires the involvement and function of stem cells resident in tissue-specific microenvironmental niches [17]. Investigations have found that a stem cell system is present in the intervertebral disc and aging has been shown to result in its decrease as well as the loss of the ability to maintain homeostasis and regenerate tissue function [17].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although animal studies and preliminary human trials have supported the future of stem cell therapy for disc diseases, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">careful application of cells and techniques</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in a strictly controlled manner is key in ensuring safety. An example was given in which cell leakage was reported after MSC (mesenchymal stem cells) injection into the intervertebral disc [17]. This can cause osteophyte formation, potentially leading to nerve impingement [17]. There is optimism that stem cells can facilitate intervertebral disc tissue engineering and repair, but in our zeal for a promising restoration we cannot afford to cause harm. While there is considerable potential for the therapeutic use of stem cells in intervertebral disc degeneration, more research is necessary. The presumption is that it will be many years before stem cell therapy becomes a mainstream solution. </span>

<b>Discussion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There are various research articles discussing the benefits of physical therapy and exercise in the treatment of chronic low back pain due to disc herniation. Core stabilization, recovering coordination, and flexibility through yoga also improves pain levels, decreases the risks of long-term disability and assists patients in returning to their daily routine. The exercises, however, must be demonstrated accurately by a professional who has the knowledge of biomechanics and is capable of ensuring that the patient performs the exercises correctly. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> Epidural steroid injections may alleviate pain and enhance function, but do not cure the underlying cause of pain. An interesting future study may be to seek a method of predicting which patients will benefit from an epidural steroid injection. There is no substantial evidence that surgical treatments result in superior pain relief long term.  Nor is there evidence that surgery can fully treat disc herniation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Surgery is the most effective treatment for immediate relief of herniated discs, but further research in regards to alternative therapy is anticipated. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">There are promising studies in the field of stem cell transplants with the potential for regeneration of intervertebral discs. However, chronic low back pain perseveres as one of the most socioeconomically and life debilitating conditions. As such, it requires further research regarding alternative treatment options. Patients require therapy that, not only alleviates, but heals the cause and root of back pain in the intervertebral discs, controls symptoms such as pain and sciatica, and prevents damage or loss of function.</span>

		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[By Arianne Medrano, Psychology- Biology Emphasis, ‘19
Author’s Note: I wrote this literature review for my UWP 104F class in my fourth year at UC Davis. My goal is to become a physical therapist and one of the most common complaints I hear from older generations is that they cannot perform activities they once loved because of a ‘bad back.’ My father experienced a disc related injury, which led to sciatica, after he fell off a ladder. This prevents him from enjoying activities such as heavy-lifting, riding roller coasters or picking up his grandson. For these reasons, I was interested in researching effective prevention and treatments to help alleviate discomfort and improve quality of life.]]></excerpt:encoded>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s note:</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrote this case study for my writing in health sciences class since allergies are a growing epidemic in the developed world. Due to the prevalence of this chronic chronic condition, food contamination is health concern for those prone to acute allergic reactions. However, little is known about the etiology of immune system dysfunction and many patients are unable to receive a concrete diagnosis. I chose to interview my friend to get a glimpse into what it’s like to manage this chronic condition and to learn more about the potential causes and treatments.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">X* had her first allergic reaction at the age of two after eating a pack of Ritz crackers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Within an hour, she started crying and became covered in hives. Thinking that their daughter was on the verge of suffocation, her parents rushed her to the emergency room, where the doctors were able to stop what turned out to be her first allergic reaction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">X’s parents did not have a reason to read the allergen warning on the Ritz pack. Her diagnosis, peanut allergies, bewildered her parents. In their Asian home country, the condition was not widely recognized. Peanut oil, a common ingredient in traditional Asian dishes, had never caused allergies in her family. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">X’s parents did not have a history of allergies, nor did they expose X to an excess of peanuts as a baby. Little information was available about the cause and management of allergies in the early 2000s when X was first diagnosed; according to the U.S. clinical allergy management guidelines claimed, environmental exposure to peanuts and peanut oil during infancy positively correlates to allergy development later in life [1]. Current research suggest that peanut proteins can activate the immune system and trigger the development of peanut-specific antibodies [2]. When the body detects the presence of an allergen, a supply of antibodies is ready attack the antigens, such as peanut proteins. However, the immune system has to be sensitized or develop antibodies to the allergen before the first allergic reaction. The first exposure does not elicit an immune response--instead it mediates the production of antibodies that are readily released upon the second exposure. Infants usually receive their first exposure in the womb or through breast milk. This logic did not fit X’s case since her mom avoided peanuts when she was pregnant to prevent the weight gain associated with peanut consumption. With no research hospital in the area, the doctors could not determine the cause of her allergies. There were no immediate treatments available apart from strict avoidance of allergen-containing foods and a prescription of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">EpiPen </span><span style="font-weight: 400">auto injectors with a dose of life-saving epinephrine to prevent anaphylaxis. EpiPen becomes useful when a patient accidentally consumes an allergen and enters anaphylaxis--an acute allergic reaction that results in a systemic drop of blood pressure and constriction of the airways. If left untreated, anaphylaxis can be fatal. Delivery of epinephrine relaxes the muscles, dilates the airways, and increases heart rate to restore blood circulation. EpiPen has saved X from these detrimental consequences on a few occasions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When X entered primary school, her mom rigorously managed her diet. X could never eat at the school cafeteria or consume processed foods in case of a peanut contamination. This resulted in conflicts between mother and daughter, especially when X could not share snacks with friends or go trick-or-treating on Halloween. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Until high school, X had been successfully avoiding peanuts, but she continued experiencing rashes and injecting herself with EpiPen. After further skin prick testing, X was diagnosed with allergies to soy, milk, and eggs. Her doctors realized that </span><span style="font-weight: 400">she became progressively sensitized to more allergens</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> since her initial diagnosis </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[3]. X’s blood work also showed abnormally high levels of IgE antibodies, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> normally defend the body against parasites. In developed countries, where the environment is artificially disinfected, IgE antibodies </span><span style="font-weight: 400">cross-react with proteins in food or pollen that are analogous to those in parasitic microorganisms [4]. Over time, IgE antibodies develop memory and contribute to a stronger response with repeated allergen contact </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[5]. Since X’s symptoms were worsening, she was prescribed weekly injections of IgE inhibitors, which eased her dietary restrictions. X was now able to eat at restaurants and not worry about traces of peanuts. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While most products have allergen warnings in the United States, X found it difficult to find information on the presence of peanuts in Asia. For instance, instead of having a soup at a restaurant that may have contained peanut oil, X resorted to a sandwich that had a hidden layer of peanut butter. After one bite, she was on the verge of anaphylaxis. She immediately injected her thigh with the EpiPen and went to the hospital. When X explained her symptoms to the hospital staff, they were unsure of the definition of peanut allergies. The emergency room doctors were powerless and X left the hospital receiving little treatment. Thankfully, a 0.3-milligram dose of epinephrine from her EpiPen was enough to keep her safe and prevent the rash from coming back. Although food allergies are uncommon in Asia, the incidence rates in urbanized cities are almost comparable to the Western world [6]. The Asian healthcare system does not have delineated guidelines for treating allergies and there is a lack of awareness and appropriate testing.  However, the rates of autoimmune disorders in developing nations remain low, possibly due to the high prevalence of parasitic infections that prevent IgE antibodies from cross-reacting with food [7]. After this life-threatening event, X avoids traveling to Asia or countries that do not have stringent food labeling guidelines.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">X also faced problems with food labeling during her first weeks of college as a freshman. While the dining hall had allergy warnings, the facility still processed nuts and did not place lids on peanut butter. X had to frequently use her EpiPen before learning how to avoid certain serving stations. Unfortunately, cross-contamination is not uncommon at public food facilities. One such example is a tragic death of a 10-year-old girl, who entered anaphylaxis after eating at a school cafeteria. When she reported experiencing asthma-like symptoms, it was too late to administer the EpiPen before her heart stopped. This tragedy led to legislature that now requires all Canadian schools to reduce exposure to allergens and train staff on prevention measures [8]. While the United States has similar laws, they are not as stringent and apply to only a few states. There is no information available if colleges comply with similar regulations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The United States’ guidelines for allergy management changed in 2016. In early 2000s clinicians recommended delaying the introduction of peanuts to a minimum of 3 years of age even though no clinical studies have been conducted to support this recommendation  [9]. In fact, complete avoidance may have exacerbated X’s condition and overall contributed to the increased prevalence of allergies in the recent decades [10]. Evidence suggests that exposing at-risk infants to small doses of peanuts earlier in life decreases fatal allergy episodes compared to avoidance [11]. Studies from Israel show that infants have a ten-fold lower risk of developing allergies if their mothers consistently consume peanuts during pregnancy [12]. This may explain why X is so sensitive to peanuts—her mom avoided peanuts when she was pregnant. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Research has led to the development of the next generation treatment that is currently in Phase III clinical trials. DBV Technologies created Viaskin, a skin patch that is saturated with peanut allergens. The antigens from the patch penetrate through the skin and safely travel to the lymph nodes, avoiding the bloodstream. Prolonged exposure to the allergen may desensitize the immune system or build tolerance, thereby improving the condition management. The long-term studies have shown a 99% decrease in life-threatening reactions from an accidental allergen exposure [13]. A placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial is currently enrolling participants at a research center near X’s house. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">X plans to either enroll in the Viaskin study or become a research assistant for the clinical trial after she graduates from college. After hearing that her allergic friend has a patch and can safely eat 16 peanuts, gives X hope that she can become allergy-free after more than two decades of fighting her condition.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Taylor Riedley, Biology, ‘20</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author's Note:</strong> I wrote this paper for my UWP 102B class with Dr. Brenda Rinard in Winter Quarter 2019. For the preliminary stage of an assignment, I reviewed primary research on metal phosphide poisoning and wrote a formal paper geared towards a medical audience. For the final stage, I translated my formal paper into this one, intending it for a curious though not necessarily scientific audience. I chose this topic because I am considering an occupation in forensic pathology, and while I searched for articles about pathological findings, I came across an autopsy of a victim of metal phosphide poisoning. I was struck by the discrepancy between the general outward symptoms and the lethal organ damage of phosphide patients. I was further appalled when I learned that metal phosphides are within ready reach of children. I viewed this paper as an opportunity to draw attention to the need for more research on metal phosphides, and especially in this more accessible incarnation, to encourage readers to advocate for those who are not given the information necessary to stay safe.</span>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400">Purpose: The goal of this article is to raise awareness about metal phosphide poisoning. Metal phosphides, although highly toxic, are used in commercial goods in Turkey, Ecuador, and India. Doctors are unable to properly diagnose and treat intoxicated patients due to a lack of understanding about metal phosphides’ biochemical effects on the human body. This culminates in the illness and death of thousands of patients every year, mostly young children or individuals with mental health issues.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Only six years ago, a four-year-old girl with common flu symptoms visited Ïnönü University’s Faculty of Medicine in Malayta, Turkey. Doctors would have given her fever reducers and a quick dismissal had the girl’s parents not mentioned finding a firecracker in her mouth. The girl did not have a flu; she was experiencing acute liver failure (ALF).  She promptly died of secondary cardiac arrest while the doctors were preparing her for a liver transplant (1). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The firecracker that killed the girl was of the Çatapat brand, which contains yellow phosphorus (YP), an explosive that is lethal in a ratio of 1 mg YP to 1 kg (2.2 lbs) body weight (2). In other words, an 18 mg dose of YP -- the size of an allergy pill -- can kill a four-year-old. YP derives its potency from its placement within a volatile group of compounds called metal phosphides. Metal phosphides release large quantities of heat and light if they come into contact with any acid, even water molecules floating in the air, so labs that experiment with metal phosphides must store them in oil. The phosphide reaction produces a phosphine gas, which is commonly used as a fumigant pesticide. When the reaction occurs inside patients, the gas escapes their bodies and can affect other individuals, as if they were a toxic diffuser. There have been cases of pet owners falling ill after driving their phosphide-intoxicated pet to the vet and of doctors experiencing symptoms after treating a patient with phosphide poisoning (3).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In spite of the threat metal phosphide poses to the human body, the Çatapat firecracker market remains successful. This is partially due to the lenient warning label laws in Turkey; Çatapat is not forced to include the potential dangers of its product on its packaging or advertisements. This lulls parents into a false sense of security, so they leave their children unsupervised with these seemingly harmless toys.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Another metal phosphide called white phosphorus (WP) is a hazard in Ecuadorian firecrackers and matches. A common method of suicide among adults, especially adolescent women with undiagnosed psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD from sexual assault, involves ingesting firecrackers called diablillos (“little devils”). The diablillos cost only $0.25 and are popular during winter festivities, but contain so much WP that ingesting just one can cause serious illness. (WP’s toxicity should come as no surprise. Its use in chemical warfare remains controversial because it effectively obliterates enemies -- and civilians.) Ecuadorian firecracker manufacturers continue to use WP instead of safer, albeit pricier, combusting agents to profit from low-income households. Likewise, incidents involving Ecuadorian matches are seen as “phossy jaw,” or phosphorus-induced cell death, in match factory workers (4). WP is continuously responsible for employee illness, but match companies refuse to use safer flame-inducers that are more expensive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Another issue involving the metal phosphide YP is the consumption of pesticides such as Ratol rat poison in India. Ratol is easily accessed in agricultural communities for crop protection. It can be accidentally eaten by children, but it is a common means of suicide among adults, especially adolescents from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (3-8). Similar pesticides containing metal phosphides have been common in Romania and Iran for over one hundred years and bring unintentional death to both farm animals and humans (3).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Metal phosphides pose an obvious danger if they are not handled with care, so we should have established a procedure for identifying and treating metal phosphide poisoning. Surprisingly, this is not the case. Doctors acknowledge the havoc metal phosphides wreak upon the body, but there is little research that identifies the biochemistry behind it (2). Even though we can see the damage done by metal phosphides during an autopsy, we do not know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">how </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">the damage is done. Without this critical information, it is impossible to engineer a specific cure.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Most patients with metal phosphide poisoning, including the four-year-old from Turkey, outwardly appear to have a flu. There are a few non-flu symptoms, including jaundice, liver palpability (when the liver is so swollen that one can feel it pushing up against the surface of the patient’s abdomen), blood cell deficiency, delayed blood clotting, low blood pressure, and irregular or elevated heart rates, but most of these are also general and are not always present (2, 4-5). An even rarer symptom is cholestasis, when the liver stops producing bile. It is a sign of liver damage and can be clinically identified from skin that itches so persistently that patients create sores from excessive scratching. Even though this points directly to the liver, it is usually unhelpful in identifying metal phosphide poisoning due to its rarity and late exhibition (6). All of these symptoms present themselves in varying combinations and last until the patient either recovers or dies; death can occur anytime between eight hours to seventeen days after metal phosphide consumption (7). If doctors are not informed that a patient consumed metal phosphides, they may be unaware of the accumulating internal damage until it is too late. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Emine Türkmen Şamdanci, a professor of pathology at Ïnönü University, performed an autopsy on the four-year-old and discovered severe organ destruction, especially in the girl’s liver and kidneys. The girl’s levels of liver enzymes were twenty times the normal value, which means her liver was working overtime to clean the metal phosphide out of her blood. The liver was also yellowed and had fatty buildup, which were indications of severe cell damage. In the kidneys, the tubular lining degraded upon contact with the metal phosphide. With the two major blood-cleansing organs out of operation, the YP spread through the bloodstream and infiltrated the girl’s other organs. Congestion was discovered in the girl’s brain, lungs, and kidneys. Finally, the heart, the capitol of the bloodstream, succumbed to this lethal destroyer (1). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Additional internal signs have been recorded in other autopsies. Some signs, such as bleeding, interstitial fluid, loss of cell nuclei, and cell death, can be shared by the liver, heart, brain, and lungs. Other signs are centralized. In the liver, these include inflammation, crumbling, and high white blood cell counts. In the heart, there can be congestion and loss of normal muscle definition. The digestive tract distinctively suffers from congestion in the mucous lining, peeling, phosphine gas, erosion, and acid buildup (2-3, 6-7). Unfortunately, these symptoms, which are more specific to metal phosphide poisoning, are only observable after a patient </span><span style="font-weight: 400">has deceased.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although there are no exact protocols for metal phosphide poisoning, doctors have multiple options to address the diverse symptoms of individual patients (7). The most common treatments aim to reduce acidity in the digestive tract to decrease the amount of metal phosphide that turns into phosphine gas. Such treatments include stomach pumping, ranitidine (an antacid and antihistamine), sodium bicarbonate (commonly known as baking soda, a relatively safe base used to neutralize acids), and activated charcoal. Other treatments support the body as it cleans the metal phosphide from the blood. These include IV fluids and electrolytes, dopamine (to improve blood flow), noradrenaline (a kidney hormone), piperacillin/tazobactam (antibiotics), and sertraline (a calming drug) (2, 4-5, 8). If a patient additionally exhibits cholestasis, ursodeoxycholic (bile) acid and skin moisturizer are commonly given (6). The most preferable treatment is a liver transplant, since the damage to the liver is often irreparable, but the procedure is extremely expensive. Given the demographics of metal phosphide victims, most patients are unable to obtain the surgery even if ALF is identified soon enough (2, 4, 8).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">With such little research about metal phosphide poisoning, some treatments are still up for debate. One of these is the use of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC), a drug used in instances of acetaminophen overdose to prevent ALF. Dr. Smitha Bhat, a professor at the Father Muller Medical College in Mangalore, India, found that patients treated with NAC had a lower death rate, so she argued that NAC would be a noteworthy substitute for patients who cannot afford a liver transplant. Unfortunately, there were far fewer patients in the NAC group than in the non-NAC group, so when the statistical calculations were conducted, the NAC group had both the lowest death rate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> the lowest survival rate (8). Other studies that included NAC did not herald it as an antidote, and some even resulted in patient death (4-5).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In summary, more research is needed to effectively diagnose and treat metal phosphide patients. Clinicians must collaborate with laboratory scientists so they can study the biochemical effects of metal phosphide gas. Doctors cannot effectively cure metal phosphide poisoning without more knowledge about how the phosphide and its derivatives chemically impact the body. Since most of the specific symptoms are internal, doctors can easily mistake clinical symptoms of metal phosphide intoxication for influenza or a multitude of other tamer illnesses. They would benefit from additional chemical tests, such as those analyzing blood content, that could help identify metal phosphide intoxication. Unfortunately, considering the demographics of patients, the communities that suffer most from metal phosphide poisoning lack the resources to find an antidote.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, individuals with financial difficulties are at a greater risk of metal phosphide poisoning. In India, those who cannot pay for mental therapy are at a greater risk of using Ratol to commit suicide. Women are especially impacted because their marginalization prevents them from receiving treatment for depression and PTSD. Instead, the availability of Ratol poses a persistent, more affordable temptation. Metal phosphides are also cheaper than safer firecracker oxidants, so companies left to their own devices stoop below the line of morality to profit from low-income customers. Countries like the United States can successfully produce firecrackers that are less toxic and cost upwards of $2 a piece, while the Turkish YP-based firecracker sells successfully because it markets for as little as $0.25 and withholds information from the public. In the absence of protective legislation, Turkish firecracker manufacturers avoid responsibility for the casualties they cause.</span>

<b>Author's Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">This report analyzes and explains the biological, chemical, and environmental importance of heptachlor. More and more in today’s society, we are utilizing synthetic compounds as agricultural insecticides, which makes understanding what these chemicals do to our bodies and the environment of utmost importance. Farming strategies may seem far-removed from our daily lives, but these chemicals do not stay on the farm. They travel to our cities, to our grocery stores and markets, then make their way onto our dinner plates and into our children’s stomachs. I am constantly amazed at the power of scientific research to transform and demystify the detrimental nature of environmental and biological toxicants; this, combined with my passion in toxicology, has inspired me to research this topic and write this manuscript.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Keywords</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, insecticide, environmental toxicology, biological toxin</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Heptachlor was introduced into the United States in the 1940s and 1950s, among the other chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides, such as DDT (4). In 1971, 500,000 kilograms of heptachlor were applied to agricultural fields in soils and seeds to prevent termite infection in woods (4). However, after it became evident that heptachlor’s toxicity was a serious health concern, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned all registered use of heptachlor because of its carcinogenic properties and bioaccumulation in food and water. With the exception of treatment of fire ants in underground power transformers, there is no use of heptachlor in the United States now (2). In contrast, heptachlor is still used as an insecticide in some areas in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe (5). The form of greater toxicological concern is heptachlor epoxide, which is a metabolite of heptachlor in soil and the human body. Heptachlor epoxide is more toxic because it degrades slower than heptachlor, thus, is more persistent in the environment. Both heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide can be found in freshwater, estuarine, and marine systems (6). This review will cover the current literature on heptachlor toxicity and investigate the impact of heptachlor on biological systems.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Biological Fate (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination) </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Humans and animals can be exposed to heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide through soil, air and water; however, the main route of exposure is oral, through consuming contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. Children and infants are especially vulnerable to heptachlor exposure if they consume large amounts of breast milk from their mother. For instance, if the mother’s breast milk is contaminated by heptachlor, heptachlor can be easily consumed by the infant through breast milk feeding. In human breast milk, heptachlor epoxide was detected ranging from 0.13 to 128 ppb (parts per billion) (8). Another route of exposure is through inhalation. When heptachlor is deposited into the soil, it becomes heptachlor epoxide, which then spreads into the air. As a result, workers who use heptachlor to kill termites are potentially susceptible to inhaling heptachlor epoxide from the air (2). In addition, touching contaminated soils causes exposure to heptachlor dermally (1). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Heptachlor persists in the environment after agricultural application. Even though there was no information on the background levels of heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide in the air or soil, there are 20 to 800 ppt (parts per trillion) heptachlor in drinking water and groundwater in the United States (2). Contaminated fish and shellfish were detected with levels of 2 to 750 ppb of heptachlor and 0.1 to 480 ppb of heptachlor epoxide. To date, there is no available data regarding the biological fate of heptachlor on humans. However, in rats, at least 50% of the orally-administered dose of heptachlor is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.The absorption is indicated by the presence of heptachlor and/or heptachlor epoxide in the rats’ liver (9). When heptachlor epoxide enters the bloodstream after absorption, it becomes the predominant metabolite in the body of laboratory female rats. Heptachlor epoxide in the bloodstream is positively correlated to the heptachlor dose administered (10). In other words, the higher heptachlor dose one consumed, the more heptachlor epoxide would appear in the bloodstream. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Because of heptachlor epoxide’s high lipophilicity (likelihood in dissolving fats), its residue is found highest in adipose tissue in human infants (0.32±0.10ppm), while undetectable in the brain. These data also suggest that heptachlor epoxide can be transferred between pregnant women and their babies through the placenta (11). Furthermore, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide can be stored in human breast milk. Jonsson et al.’s study in 1977 sampled the breast milk of 51 women who had no previously known exposure to heptachlor and detected an average concentration of heptachlor epoxide between 0.0027ppm and 0.019ppm (12). To the researchers, the results proved worrisome as the women's breast milk contained high levels of heptachlor, which could damage the infant. The results were even more of a concern because there was no known interaction between the women studied and heptachlor.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">After heptachlor is absorbed in the body, the primary metabolite of heptachlor in humans and rats is heptachlor epoxide. Heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide are usually metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. CYP450 enzymes are the body’s major class of enzymes responsible for detoxification. Moreover, heptachlor alters liver function by increasing gluconeogenic enzymes’ activities, which upregulates glucose synthesis from glycogen. Since most of heptachlor is metabolized in the liver, humans with liver diseases may have increased bioaccumulation of heptachlor epoxide because of decreased CYP450 enzyme activity (13). Despite the metabolism of heptachlor in the liver, most heptachlor epoxide can be stored in the adipose tissue because of its high lipophilicity and long half-life (1). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In terms of excretion, orally-administered heptachlor in rats was excreted in the form of heptachlor epoxide and also as heptachlor. Radiolabeled heptachlor epoxide is excreted ten times more in the feces compared to urine after ten days of oral administration in rats, due to the high lipophilicity of heptachlor metabolites (8).</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Mechanism of Action</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The primary organ and organ systems that heptachlor targets are the liver, central nervous system and reproductive system, while secondary target organs include kidneys and lungs. Heptachlor is primarily metabolized in the liver into heptachlor epoxide, which has the same toxic potential. The reproductive system is a sensitive target for heptachlor toxicity because this system lacks a comprehensive detoxification system like the CYP450 enzymes in liver. CYP450 enzymes facilitate chemical reactions that chemically convert the toxicant into a more hydrophilic metabolite, thereby enhancing toxicant elimination by urine. Oral exposure of 1.8 mg/kg/day to female rats over 14 days caused decreased fertility due to decreased estradiol and progesterone levels. Estradiol and progesterone are important hormones produced by the ovaries, placenta, and adrenal glands; decreased levels may result in endocrine disruption and delayed sexual development. Oral exposure of 0.65 mg/kg/day over 70 days caused decreased sperm count in male rats. The mechanism of heptachlor’s reproductive toxicity remains unknown (1-2).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">GABA, the molecule that normally binds the GABA receptor, is an amino acid which can also serve as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Heptachlor primarily acts as a noncompetitive antagonist of the chloride channels of the GABA</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> receptors in mammals.  In other words, heptachlor blocks the Chlorine channel in the cells thus preventing GABA</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> activation (1-2, 14). By inhibiting the inhibitory neuron, heptachlor causes hyperexcitability of the cells. Although the heptachlor toxicity mechanism in liver is unknown, it is observed that in rats that presence of heptachlor elevates intracellular calcium levels and induces protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn activates the activator protein-1 DNA binding thereby causing tumorigenesis (2, 14). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When animals are exposed to heptachlor above the toxic threshold, symptoms occur including tremors, convulsions, ataxia, and changes in EEG patterns (1). Also, rats who were orally exposed to &gt;320 ppm of heptachlor had consistently lower body weight than rats that were unexposed (15). In humans, clinical symptoms of heptachlor toxicity include seizure, vomiting, and convulsions (2). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although heptachlor epoxide is theoretically an effective mutagen because of its high reactivity as an electrophile, research studies on heptachlor mutagenicity yielded mostly negative results. For example, heptachlor was not mutagenic in the auxotrophic strains of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">E. coli</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> by reversion bioassays (14,15). In addition, heptachlor is proven to increase liver tumor incidence as an epigenetic promoter in previously initiated B6C3F1 mice. Heptachlor is a carcinogen in mice by inhibiting intercellular communications to promote tumor growth (14,16). On the other hand, research studies that investigate heptachlor’s teratogenicity, or tendency to disturb embryonic development, yielded mostly negative results. For instance, although feeding rats with diets containing heptachlor produces pups with higher mortality, no congenital malformation was found (2, 14, 17). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In male rats, oral LD</span><span style="font-weight: 400">50</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> (lethal dose for 50% of the study population) of heptachlor is 40 to 100 mg/kg body weight based on data from two studies. In contrast, the oral LD</span><span style="font-weight: 400">50</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of heptachlor in male chickens is 62 mg/kg body weight (1, 17). Symptoms displayed by heptachlor acute toxicity in animal subjects include hyperexcitability, tremors, convulsions and paralysis (18). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Long-term exposure to heptachlor can cause liver damage in animals. In rats, prolonged exposure of sub-lethal doses of heptachlor is associated with increased CYP450 enzyme induction and other hepatic microsomal enzymes, in addition to liver hypertrophy (18). In humans, chronic exposure to heptachlor results in storage in adipose tissue and breast milk, because heptachlor is very lipophilic. Infants are at risk of being exposed to large doses of heptachlor if they consume contaminated breast milk (17). Despite the lack of human studies on long-term exposure, a multi-generation study conducted on rats concluded that oral exposure of 6 mg/kg/day of heptachlor is associated with decreased litter size, increased mortality and lens cataract (2). Because of its high lipophilicity, heptachlor residues can remain in the body over time. Heptachlor’s long-term toxicity damages the body gradually, further underlying the need for strict regulations of heptachlor use worldwide.  </span>

<b>Overview of Latest Research</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Recent research on heptachlor focuses on its toxicity, specifically on the oxidative stress caused by heptachlor and its metabolism in aquatic animals. For example, Vineela et al.’s study investigates the impact of sub-lethal concentrations of heptachlor on carp fish Catla catla by measuring enzymatic activities of mostly Phase II enzymes (19). Phase II enzymes, a part of the CYP450 enzyme class, primarily perform conjugation reactions to convert the chemical into more water-soluble form to enhance urine elimination. Oral exposure of heptachlor at 1.46mg/L (20% of LC50 concentration) for 45 days causes a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase activity in Catla catla. The results suggest that carp fish have a sensitive biological defense system against heptachlor, because low concentration activates the detoxification by increased biomarkers of primarily Phase II activity to prevent heptachlor toxicity and organ damage (19). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to heptachlor toxicity, current research also focuses on how to remove existing heptachlor from the environment via microbial degradation, as this method is more environmentally mindful and cost-effective than current physicochemical methods. Qiu et al.’s study discovered a novel strain of bacteria, named strain H, that can metabolize heptachlor efficiently. Strain H is a Gram-negative, short rod-shaped, single-cell bacterial strain that can degrade heptachlor at a rate of 88.2% degradation in 130 hours when exposed to 300 μg/L of heptachlor at 30</span><span style="font-weight: 400">o</span><span style="font-weight: 400">C. The main metabolites of heptachlor by strain H include heptachlor epoxide, chlordane epoxide, and 1-hydroxychorodene. This innovation allows possible bioremediation by microorganisms like strain H in heptachlor-contaminated soil and water to reduce heptachlor toxicity and threat to the environment and animals (20). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Recent studies on heptachlor took a creative approach in gaining a deeper understanding in reducing heptachlor toxicity by enzymatic activity in aquatic model organisms and inventing novel microorganisms to metabolize heptachlor into less toxic metabolites. These new techniques will benefit public health by developing cost-effective ways for toxicant removal and controlling the environmental/biological fate of toxicants without causing additional harm.   </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusions</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When initially used as an insecticide, heptachlor’s toxicity became a threatening health concern. The ban of commercial heptachlor use in the United States was a step in the right direction, as misuse of heptachlor can cause severe environmental consequences such as prolonged residue in soil and water habitats along with toxicities in humans and animals. Based on this research, other countries should pursue a substitute pesticide that has less potential for environmental and biological damage than heptachlor. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Most studies conducted regarding heptachlor toxicity were conducted between the 1950s and the late 1980s. Future research can focus on the dose-response relationship of heptachlor exposure within large populations and whether genetic polymorphism contributes to the metabolism of heptachlor. Environmental toxicologists can also study the synergistic toxicity of heptachlor on environmental damage with other pesticides, since common pesticides often contain more than one chemical (1,2).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Residing in the pancreas are clusters of specialized cells, namely alpha, beta (), and delta cells. cells, more specifically, are insulin-secreting cells that are instrumental in the body’s glucose regulation mechanism. An elevation of the extracellular glucose concentrations allows glucose to enter cells via GLUT2 transporters, where it is subsequently metabolized. The resultant increase in ATP catalyzes the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, triggering the depolarization of the plasma membrane which in turn stimulates insulin release by cells (1). In individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), however, pancreatic islet beta cells are damaged by pro-inflammatory cytokines that are released by the body’s own immune cells. The loss of functional beta cell mass induces a dangerous dysregulation of glucose levels, resulting in hyperglycemia along with other harmful side effects. The absence of a regulatory factor in the bloodstream forces those with T1D to take insulin intravenously to remedy the consequences.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A new study led by Dr. Ercument Dirice, a Harvard Medical School (HMS) instructor and research associate at the Joslin Diabetes Center. has suggested that an increase in cell mass early in life diminishes the autoreactive behavior of immune cells towards cells, therefore halting the development of T1D (2). In a typical T1D model, the secretion of antigens from cells induces a response from the body’s immune cells. These immune cells bind to the epitopes (the recognizable portion of an antigen) that are displayed on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (APC’s) which are littered throughout the pancreatic islets (3). This binding action induces a destructive autoimmune response to antigens secreted by cells, resulting in loss of functional beta-cell mass. It was found however that by increasing cell mass at an early age where the organs of the immune system are still developing, the immune cells stopped attacking cells. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The novel approach presented by Dirice et al. departs from the traditional method of targeting various other components involved in the destructive autoimmune response, namely APC’s or the pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with T1D progression. This method instead focuses on the source of the autoimmune marked “pathogenic” antigens, the cells themselves. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The studies were completed using two models of female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. One was a genetically engineered model of female mice (NOD-LIRKO) that showed increased cell growth soon after birth while the second model was done using a live mouse that was injected at an early age with an agent known to increase cell proliferation. While maintaining more than 99.5% isogenicity (4), it was found that the mice with increased cell mass had a significantly lower predisposition to develop diabetes when compared against the NOD control mice, which developed severe diabetes between 20-35 weeks of age. The study also observed the interaction between the modified cells and immune cells by monitoring the concentration of these immune cells in the spleen. In doing this, researchers were able to conclude which mice had a greater risk of developing T1D based on if mice had an abnormal increase in the concentration of these cells. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, this method appears counterintuitive as an increase in cell mass may lead one to naively assume that this would result in increased autoantigen production. This precise hypothesis illustrates the beauty of this approach. Although the specific details of this mechanism have yet to be made clear, it is believed that the rapid turnover of cells “confuses” the autoimmune reaction. The proliferated   cells present unusual autoantibodies that are not observed in typical T1D progression. Dr. Rohit Kulkarni, a fellow HMS professor and researcher at Joslin noted that there is thought to be some alteration in the new cells where the autoantigens typically produced are reduced or dilated (2). As a result of the slow presentation of antigens, there is a lower proportion of autoreactive immune cells. This essentially results in a “reshapen immune profile that specifically protects   cells from being targeted.” Some degree of autoimmunity would continue to exist in the body, so further immunosuppressive treatment would be required. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Early cell proliferation has been previously speculated to have a protective effect in those with reduced functional cell mass as in a Type 1 Diabetes model. Once this preventative quality is better understood, applications of this research may be further explored. Despite still being in the beginning stages, this novel approach holds tremendous potential for application to T1D if this method is able to be translated to a human model. The massive prevalence of a T1D diagnosis is illustrated by 2014 census data that states that T1D affects roughly 4.7% of the world’s adult population. Although extensive research continues to be done on several aspects of the disease, the introduction of new data by Dirice et al. may push us a small step closer to solving one of the body’s greatest metabolic mysteries. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Neha Madugala, Cognitive Science, ‘22</strong>

<b>Author’s Note:</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I came across an article detailing the future of surgery. What initially seems like science fiction may be becoming a reality as more and more surgeries are being administered by robots. Through my research, however, I found that robot-assisted surgeries may have the initial appeal of lowering human error, but there are still various issues that must be resolved before they can fully take over in the surgical room. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Robot-assisted surgeries boast the potential of shorter recovery time, less pain and blood, and fewer scars and infections. They have been on the market for a little less than twenty years, and have been used in cancer procedures for about the past fifteen years. While the FDA has approved these devices for other procedures, robot-assisted surgeries have not officially been approved for cancer treatments. Regardless, surgeons have been and continue to perform robot-assisted surgery for cancer-related procedures due to their benefits and increased efficiency. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Robot-assisted surgeries mainly contrast from traditional surgeries because they can be performed  through small cuts in the patient’s body. As a result, they are minimally invasive. There are three robotic arms, allowing for multiple angles for improved accuracy, which perform the incisions. According to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the robotic arms are controlled by a computer and software that replicates the operating surgeon’s movements. This occurs as the operating surgeon performs the movements while looking at a magnified and high-definition screen of the surgical site captured by a camera attached to the robot. While the device requires limited retraining for surgeons, as of now, there is only one company actually offering this device. Interestingly, the device requires less precision and attention by the surgeon due to the magnification and the actual incisions being performed by the robot. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In 2000, the FDA approved for one of the first robot-assisted systems to be brought to the market. The system, called the da Vinci Surgical System promised to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of medical surgeries, not just cancer-related surgeries. In order to bring the system to the market quickly, the robotic surgery system went through “premarket notification,” allowing the company to skip the rigorous safety and efficacy trials. Essentially, “premarket notification” is supposed to ensure that a device is safe and this notation helps quicken a device’s journey to the market. The FDA said that this decision was based only on short-term data and a spokesperson stated that the decision was made “based on evaluation of the device as a surgical tool and did not include evaluation of outcomes related to the treatment of cancer.” The device promises more successful surgeries with limited retraining and a smooth transition from a humancentric to robot-assisted surgery. These prospects posed limited risks and the evident benefit of improving the success rate of these surgeries; as a result, the device was approved without a thorough and holistic evaluation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While this system has only been approved for some urological and gynecological procedures, these devices are used for a vast array of other unapproved procedures. The FDA can assess the safety of these devices for certain procedures, but they cannot prevent these systems from being used in unapproved settings in the medical field. As a result, medical professionals may still use these systems for procedures that have not been approved by the FDA.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">At the beginning of March, the FDA released a statement reminding the public that robot-assisted surgeries have not been approved for mastectomy or cancer-related surgeries, two procedures for which the device is frequently used. Dr. Terri Cornelison, who works for the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, has stated,  “We are warning patients and providers that the use of robotically-assisted surgical devices for any cancer-related surgery has not been granted marketing authorization by the agency. The survival benefits to patients when compared to traditional surgery have not been established.” The FDA has claimed that there is no supporting evidence that robot-assisted surgeries are better than traditional surgeries and they have further claimed that robot-assisted surgeries result in more problems for patients receiving treatment for cervical cancer. Cornelison further states, “We want doctors and patients to be aware of the lack of evidence of safety and effectiveness for these uses so they can make better informed decisions about their cancer treatment and care.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The FDA cited two studies that warn against the danger of robot-assisted surgery. Both studies were published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Both studies analyzed the difference between robot-assisted and traditional procedures for cervical cancer in women. The first study found that women who received surgery with robotic methods faced four times as many cancer recurrences and six times as many deaths. It should be noted that the procedure - radical hysterectomy - is considered to be a relatively safe procedure when performed correctly that can cure patients of cervical cancer. Furthermore, in the second study, 9.1% of the sample group died after minimally invasive surgeries, or in other words robot-assisted surgeries, and 5.3% died in open surgeries, which involve no robotic mechanisms. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It is not clear why robot-assisted surgeries have had worse results for cervical cancers. Dr. Pedro T. Ramirez, a surgical researcher at the Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, believes that these results may be due to the device or because carbon dioxide, which is used to provide a working and viewing space for the surgeon, may increase the spread of cancer during the procedure.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">These findings by the FDA encourage patients to question their medical professionals about what type of procedures they will receive and to know the facts about different methods for surgery. In order to ensure that they receive the best care, it is important that patients have a say in the procedure they will receive by accurately weighing the risks and benefits. While the FDA cannot stop the use of these tools in the medical field, increased interest and probing of the mechanics of these systems are helping raise awareness about what is actually happening in the operation room. </span>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Author’s Note</strong>
I would like to give special thanks to Professor Katherine Gossett (UC Davis) for encouraging me to write this paper and Dr. Angela Haczku (UC Davis Health) for her expertise in pulmonary diseases. Last fall, I decided to research idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after my grandfather was hospitalized and diagnosed with it over the previous summer. I quickly discovered that there wasn’t much research on the disease itself or how to treat it due to its rarity. The purpose of this literature review is to inform others about idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and to encourage further research on the subject. With time, this research could be vital in saving lives just like that of my grandfather.

<strong>Abstract</strong>
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an irreversible and fatal disease of the lungs. Although it has been associated with genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking, environmental factors (e.g. occupational exposure to gases, smoke, chemicals, or dusts) and other conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the mechanism and causes of IPF are not yet fully understood by researchers. However, recent studies have provided evidence that IPF may be caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the inhalation of chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants. These chemicals have been identified as polymethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG-P), didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), oligo(2-(2-ethoxy)-ethoxyethyl) guanidinium chloride (PGH), and a mixture of chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) and methylisothiazolinone (MIT). It has been suggested that the generation of ROS by these chemicals is responsible for damaging the cellular structures of the lungs and triggering the development of IPF through the activation of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. Studies have also shown microRNAs to be key regulators of the TGF-β pathway and the development of the disease. Several promising future treatments of IPF involve the inhibition of the TGF-ꞵ signaling pathway either through the administration of drugs containing sesquiterpene lactones, matrine, or oridonin compounds; or through the replenishment or inhibition of certain miRNAs. The studies detailed here highlight the importance of further research on IPF.
<strong>Keywords:</strong> idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis | PHMG-P | TGFβ | miRNA

<strong>Introduction</strong>
Pulmonary fibrosis is an irreversible, fatal disease that results in scarring of the lung tissue and decreased function of the lungs. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis simply means that the cause is unknown. Patients with IPF typically experience difficulty breathing, with death caused by either respiratory failure or incurrent pneumonia. [1] The disease is characterized by marked collagen deposition and other alterations to the extracellular matrix (ECM), a network of macromolecules that provide structural support to the lungs. [1] These alterations to the ECM remodel and stiffen the lung’s airspaces and tissues. [1] It is also characterized by diffuse interstitial inflammation and respiratory dysfunction. [2] Although its cause remains unknown, it is believed that the main steps in the pathogenesis of IPF are initiated by the transforming growth factor β (TGF-ꞵ) signaling pathway and involves the migration, proliferation, and activation of lung fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts. [3] Fibroblasts are cells that have a high ability to proliferate and to produce ECM and fibrogenic cytokines. [3] Fibrogenic cytokines are multifunctional immunoregulatory proteins that contribute to the inflammatory cell recruitment and activation needed to promote the development of fibrosis. [4] These cytokines can activate myofibroblasts, which are primarily responsible for the synthesis and excessive accumulation of ECM components, collagen and fibronectin, during the repair process that leads to fibrosis. [5], [6]

A 2011 outbreak of pulmonary fibrosis in South Korea prompted an onslaught of research as to how IPF may be caused and treated. [7] Specifically, this research has provided evidence that certain chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants can cause IPF through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have a powerful oxidizing capability that can induce the destruction of cellular and subcellular structures in the lung, including DNA, proteins, lipids, cell membranes, and mitochondria. [8] This damage caused by ROS has been found to promote the activation of the TGF-ꞵ signaling pathway and the development of numerous characteristics associated with IPF. [4] This research has been invaluable for the discovery of new potential treatments for patients with IPF.

<strong>Potential inducers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</strong>
After the 2011 outbreak in South Korea, researchers were able to find a connection between IPF and exposure to chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants, such as those found in humidifiers and pools. They have suspected that these chemicals can cause pulmonary fibrosis by infiltrating the respiratory system as aerosol particles to induce cellular damage. The chemicals polymethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG-P), didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), oligo (2-(2-ethoxy) ethoxyethyl guanidinium chloride (PGH), and the mixture of chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) and methylisothiazolinone (MIT) attracted particular interest.

In a study evaluating registered lung disease cases in South Korea, it was revealed that 70 percent of registered patients that suffered from IPF or other forms of household humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury had used humidifier disinfectants containing the chemicals PHMG, PGH, or a mix of CMIT and MIT prior to their development of the disease [7] It was determined that the aerosol water droplets emitted by the humidifiers may have acted as carriers to deliver these chemicals into the lower part of the respiratory system, causing humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury. [7] It was also revealed that most of the affected patients in the study had used humidifier disinfectant containing the chemical PHMG. [7]

Another study detailed that even slight exposure to PHMG could cause cell death triggered by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). [8] Injury by ROS is typically followed by a fibrotic repair process involving increases in TGF-ꞵ expression, increased fibronectin, collagen synthesis, and a marked increase in the deposition of the ECM, all key characteristics of IPF. [4]

One way that ROS promote ECM deposition and IPF is by activating transcription factors like nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). [4] NF-κB is a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines that is typically bound to a cytoplasmic inhibitor. [9] One study found that exposure to the biocide (substance that destroys/prevents growth in organisms) and preservative PHMB was able to generate significant ROS levels and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway through the degradation of its inhibitor. [10] This is significant because the activation of proinflammatory cytokines is necessary for the recruitment and activation of myofibroblasts responsible for the increased ECM deposition that is characteristic of IPF patients. PHMB is also a cationic chemical and there is evidence that it can bind to negatively charged mucins, located within the mucous membranes of various organs. This can cause organs located in the respiratory tract to acquire increased susceptibility to PHMB and, in effect, a higher likelihood for the development of IPF. [10] Although the study did not match the exposure conditions of PHMB in humans, it has illuminated another way that individuals may develop IPF. [10]

In a study investigating the role of DDAC—one of the aerosols— in causing pulmonary fibrosis, mice exposed to DDAC exhibited fibrotic lesions that increased in severity over time. [11] Exposure to the chemical DDAC increased TGF-β signaling and appeared to maintain the differentiation of myofibroblasts. [11] This was complemented by the high expression of genes responsible for the production of collagen in fibrogenic lungs. [11] Overall, the form of pulmonary fibrosis that was induced by DDAC was mild, and so more research must be conducted before it can be concluded that the chemical DDAC is responsible for irreversible, severe pulmonary fibrosis. [11] It is also possible that some of the patients affected with humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury may have experienced synergistic or additive effects from using multiple humidifier disinfectants, but this can be difficult to determine. [7] However, this study does indicate that exposure to DDAC can result in the development of several characteristics typically associated with IPF.

<strong>PHMG-P as a potential causative of IPF</strong>
Of the chemicals listed in this literature review, PHMG-P has received the most attention by researchers. PHMG-P is a biocide that exhibits its antibacterial effect by disrupting the cell wall and inner membrane of bacteria, causing cellular leakage. [12] In a similar manner, PHMG-P can infiltrate the lungs in the form of aerosol particles and may cause IPF in individuals through the generation of ROS and the disruption of the ECM’s alveolar basement membrane. [4]

Disruption of the basement membrane occurs through increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that degrade various components of connective tissue matrices. [6] Metalloproteinase MMP2, in particular, destroys the basement membrane by solubilizing ECM elastin, fibronectin, and collagen, helping immune cells and fibroblasts migrate to alveolar spaces. [12] This can lead to severe damage of the lung architecture and aberrant ECM deposition typical of IPF. [4]

In a study using an air-liquid interface (ALI) co-culture model to study the pathogenesis of fibrosis, PHMG-P was shown to trigger ROS generation, airway barrier injury, and inflammatory response. [4] Recall that exposure to other chemicals suspected of being potential inducers of IPF had similar effects. Therefore, it can be concluded that PHMG-P infiltrates the lungs in the form of aerosol particles and induces airway barrier injury by ROS. [4] This would result in the release of fibrotic inflammatory cytokines and trigger a wound-healing response that would eventually lead to pulmonary fibrosis. [4]

In an animal study, mice exposed to PHMG-P experienced difficulty breathing and exhibited pathological lesions similar to the pathological features observed in humans affected with IPF. [12] A time course of 10 weeks was even established for PHMG-P-induced pulmonary fibrosis. [12] Throughout this period, it was found that a single instillation of PHMG-P contributed to an increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels and elicited an influx of inflammatory cells into lung tissue. [12] This recruitment of inflammatory cells contributes to the deposition of ECM components in the lungs and, as a result, the development of IPF. The instillation of PHMG-P was also suspected of blocking T cell development and impairing its function in the immune system. [6] This would result in an insufficient resolution of inflammation caused by the increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and result in stacked fibrotic changes and the progression of IPF. [6]

Another study claimed that PHMG-P could cause pulmonary fibrosis through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. [9] Recall that the NF-κB signaling pathway is responsible for the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the development of IPF. According to the study, mice exposed to PHMG-P generated a large amount of ROS and produced significant levels of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner. [9] These cytokines produced by the NF- κB signaling pathway are known to activate the TGF-β signaling pathway, increase collagen production, and promote wound-healing and tissue remodeling responses. [4] As these responses are characteristic of IPF and the cytokines exhibited in this study are known to be produced through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, there is strong evidence that PHMG-P can induce IPF through the NF-κB signaling pathway.

<strong>The Mechanism of IPF</strong>
<em>TGF-β’s importance in the mechanism</em>
Various studies of IPF have indicated that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), one of the most significant fibrotic cytokines, plays a key role in the mechanism that induces IPF. TGF-β1 is credited with inducing the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and upregulating the secretion of ECM proteins (like collagen) in IPF. [13]

Specifically, growth factor TGF-β1 binds directly to the TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII), triggering the recruitment and activation of receptor TGFβRI by TGFβRII. [14] This step leads to the increased production of collagen through the activation of a collection of proteins called the Smad 2/3 complex. [13] The activated Smad 2/3 complex accomplishes this by entering the nucleus to enhance the transcription of profibrotic genes such as those that produce collagen. [13] This idea has been heavily supported by experimental evidence. Exposure to the chemical DDAC was found to increase cellular mRNA levels of TGF-β1 by two-fold. [11] This increase contributed to the activation of the Smad 2/3 complex [11] and induced the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. [15] Overall, this led to the development of pulmonary fibrosis-causing fibrotic lesions in mice. [11]

In another study, TGF-β was found to promote the development of IPF by inhibiting the expression of the microRNA let-7d, driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased collagen deposition. [1] Typically, epithelial cells are important to maintaining lung functionality by acting as a barrier against pathogens and other harmful compounds and secreting protective substances. [4] During EMT, however, these cells increase in cellular motility [16] and are transformed into myofibroblasts, resulting in the acceleration of IPF. [4] Additionally, epithelial cells during EMT promote the recruitment of fibroblasts, while simultaneously inhibiting collagen degradation and elevating the levels of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). [4] TIMP-1 binds to metalloproteinase MMP2 to promote the growth of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, accelerating ECM deposition while preventing its degradation. [12] This corroborates the claim that the TGF-β signaling pathway is a crucial component in the mechanism of IPF.

<em>MicroRNA’s role in TGF-β regulation and pulmonary fibrosis</em>
MicroRNAs are mRNA sequences that bind to complementary mRNA of proteins to prevent their translation and expression. They are also involved in multiple steps of fibrosis, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. [16] During the progression of IPF, miRNAs are known to regulate the process in which epithelial cells transition into myofibroblasts (EMT) to promote fibrosis. [16] Since each miRNA is specific to a particular mRNA sequence, miRNAs may function as either promoters or inhibitors of IPF. One study found that the miRNA, miR-433, can act as a promoter of IPF by upregulating receptor TGFβRI and growth factor TGF-β1 to amplify TGF-β signaling. [13] In a separate study, it was confirmed that miR-30c-1-3p may act as a negative regulator of pulmonary fibrosis through targeting the mRNA and preventing the expression of receptor TGFβRII. [15]

In a study headed by the Department of Pathology at the University of Michigan Medical School, it was concluded that the development and pace of progression of IPF may be due to abnormal miRNA generation and processing. [1] It was found that in rapidly progressing IPF biopsies, five miRNAs significantly increased and one decreased when compared to slowly progressive biopsies. [1] This indicates that miRNAs have a significant influence on the mechanism of IPF. Additionally, members of the miR-30c and let-7d family significantly decreased in both forms of IPF when compared with unaffected individuals. [1] As stated previously, certain members of the miR-30c family are believed to be negative regulators of IPF and members of the let-7d family are inhibitors of EMT. All of the stated evidence signifies that miRNAs, in addition to the TGF-β signaling pathway, play important roles in the development of IPF.

<em>Other factors to consider in the mechanism</em>
The NALP3 inflammasome is another important factor to consider in the mechanism of IPF. The NALP3 inflammasome is an innate immune system receptor suspected of being the main cause of persistent inflammatory response and exacerbation of fibrotic changes. [12] According to a study focused on researching PHMG-P-induced fibrosis in mice, the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome appeared to contribute to fibroblast proliferation and the progression of IPF due to the production of the cytokine IL-1β. [12] IL-1β is known to increase the production of ROS needed to induce lung tissue damage by upregulating the expression of the cytokine chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1). [6] This upregulation of CXCL1 and resulting tissue damage was exhibited in the study, reinforcing the claim that the NALP3 inflammasome is a central component in the IPF mechanism. [12]

Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), an antibody that has an important role in the immune system, also may have a role in the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis. In a study supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, immunoglobulin A, the most abundant human immunoglobulin, was compared with TGF-β in its role in inducing pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. [3] In this study, sIgA enhanced collagen production and induced responses in cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). [3] MCP-1, similar to IL-6 and IL-8, is responsible for stimulating collagen synthesis and TGF-β production in fibroblasts. [6] It was concluded that under IPF, sIgA may make contact with lung fibroblasts and result in exacerbating airway inflammation and fibrosis through enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines and ECM collagen. [3]

<strong>Potential therapeutic approaches and alternative methods of treatment</strong>
According to recent studies, only two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been approved by the FDA for IPF treatment, and they have still failed to be significantly effective in treating the disease. [13] However, current studies on therapeutics that inhibit the TGF-β signaling pathway appear promising. Two particular drugs of interest are oridonin and matrine, along with their derivatives.

Oridonin, a major compound found in the herb Rabdosia rubescens, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammation and cancer for hundreds of years. [2] In a study focused on testing its effectiveness in treating IPF, it was found that exposure to oridonin significantly decreased the levels of three major biomarkers of fibrosis—hydroxyproline (HYP), beta silicomolibdic acid (β-SMA), and collagen, type 1, alpha 1 (COL1A1)—in a dose-dependent manner. [2] Additionally, oridonin attenuated pathological changes such as alveolar space collapse and infiltration of inflammatory cells. [2] Oridonin was able to achieve this through significantly inhibiting the upregulation of collagen production and the activation of Smad 2/3 in lung tissues, an important step in the progression of IPF through the TGF-β signaling pathway. [2] This presents a strong case for the use of oridonin as a treatment for IPF.

Matrine, similar to oridonin, also has roots in traditional Chinese medicine. Matrine has been shown in several studies to exhibit significant antifibrotic effects through the inhibition of the TGF-β pathway. In one study, matrine was shown to have an inhibitory effect against liver fibrosis by reducing the expression of TGF-β1 and instead increasing the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). [13] Through the inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad pathway, matrine was also shown to exhibit antifibrotic activities on cardiac fibrosis. [13] These antifibrotic effects are not just held by matrine, but their derivatives as well. The matrine derivative MASM was also shown to exhibit potent antifibrotic effects. [13] As the TGF-β signaling pathway is a central component in the mechanism of IPF, matrine and their derivatives present themselves as strong candidates for anti-IPF therapeutics.

Other drug candidates for the treatment of IPF are sesquiterpene lactones. Sesquiterpene lactones are naturally occurring compounds that are known to harbor extensive connections with the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. [5] This makes these compounds and their analogues strong drug candidates for IPF treatment. In one study, two out of 44 semi-synthetic analogues of sesquiterpene lactones were found to highly inhibit the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, ECM production, and the formation of fibroblasts. [5] This inhibition of ECM production and the formation of fibroblasts corroborates the claim that administering sesquiterpene lactones is an effective treatment for IPF.

As mentioned earlier, studies have shown microRNAs to be negative regulators of IPF. One study suggests that the replenishment of miR-30c may be a promising treatment. [15] Increased levels of miR-30c would promote the negative regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, suppressing the differentiation of myofibroblasts and preventing excessive collagen accumulation. In this manner, the replenishment of miR-30c would attenuate IPF symptoms. The inhibition of certain miRNAs, such as miR-34a, has also been shown to be an effective treatment. The inhibition of miR-34a by treatment with the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (CSP) was found to prevent pulmonary fibrosis by preventing the overgrowth of fibroblasts. [17] Although the manipulation of miRNA expression has been shown to have a large impact on the development of IPF, there is one issue with this method of treatment. A single miRNA can target thousands of mRNAs, making the function miRNAs have in pathophysiological events involved in IPF unclear. [17]

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Although there is limited research on the etiology of IPF, this should only serve to motivate researchers to study its causes, mechanism, and potential treatments further. Thus far, the chemicals that have been shown to be potential inducers of IPF are PHMG-P, DDAC, PHMB, PGH, and the mixture of CMIT and MIT. However, out of all the chemicals, only PHMG-P has been heavily researched, and so additional studies are needed to confirm the other chemicals’ involvement in inducing IPF. Additionally, this research could be expanded upon through the study of the effects of other household disinfectants on the human body to determine whether they are also factors in inducing IPF. Besides the discovery of potential causatives, studies have also further illuminated details about the mechanism. Specifically attracting interest is the TGF-β signaling pathway in addition to miRNAs and their involvement in the regulation of IPF. Furthermore, the manipulation of TGF-β and miRNA levels with oridonin, matirne, and sesquiterpene lactones has been linked to favorable outcomes in the treatment of IPF. With further research, these treatments could become common practice and improve the quality of life for patients suffering from IPF.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Anjali Borad, Psychology ‘21  </strong>

<strong>Author's Note:</strong> This paper explores the dynamic relationship between a mother and her son and the complexity of a health condition that the son has. I will look at a specific case of cerebral palsy—my brother—and talk about how his condition came to be and the likely prognosis. I want to delve into the details of how family dynamics play a very important role in the caregiving and caretaking that goes along with having a disabled family member and how that is seen in the relationship between my brother and my mother.

<span style="font-weight: 400">I see two different perspectives of my brother, Sam, and his condition, cerebral palsy: one through his eyes and the other through the eyes of my mother, his caregiver. Observing how my mother has taken care of Sam from the beginning, I began to realize that it takes a lot to be a caregiver and that she plays a significant role in his life. In order to gain more insight into her practices of giving care, I interviewed her. I started off by asking her what it means to be a caregiver and what “care” means to her. She took a deep breath in and expressed her daily routines as a caregiver. “Waking up in the morning, the first thing that you have to do is to attend to him and care for him before yourself,” she said. “You know that from brushing his teeth to giving him a shower and feeding him, we have to do everything from A to Z.”[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1]</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> A day in the life of my mother starts and ends with my brother, from getting him out of bed to providing him with basic needs like food and water. She even takes care of specific requests that pertain to his own interests, such as wearing a watch every day and having matching socks and pants. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder. Most cases of cerebral palsy occur under hypoxic conditions during the birthing process. This lack of oxygen to the brain can cause developmental delays and lifelong debilitating conditions [2]. My family and I have experienced the difficulties and limitations that accompany this disease first hand. My brother’s condition of cerebral palsy is in its most extreme form: he has quadriplegia </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> spasticity. A telltale sign of quadriplegic cerebral palsy is the inability to voluntarily control and use the extremities. Spasticity occurs due to a lesion in the upper motor neuron, located in the brain and spinal cord. It interferes with the signals that your muscles need to move and manifests in the body by increasing muscle tone and making the muscles unusually tight [3]. Dr. Neil Lava, a member of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and American Academy of Neurology, describes the pathophysiology of a lack of muscular activity. “When your muscles don’t move for a long time, they become weak and stiff,” Lava writes [4]. This physical restraint is evident in my brother’s case because he has been wheelchair-bound since the age of seven. </span>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-2976 alignright" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" />

<span style="font-weight: 400">Upper motor neuron lesions can worsen over time. Major prolonged symptoms include over-responsive reflexes, weakness in the extensor muscles, and slow movement of the body, all of which affect the sensation of balance and coordination. For this kind of condition, occupational and physical therapy can alleviate some of the symptomatic stresses. In the case of therapy, performing the right kind of stretches can help to relax some muscle stiffness. Medication and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">certain surgical procedures can also treat upper motor neuron symptoms. Some common muscle relaxants prescribed to patients are Zanaflex, Klonopin and Baclofen [5].</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">At the neurochemical level, “Spasticity results from an inadequate release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system,” according to Mohammed Jan [6].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">In a normal neural cell, when GABA interacts with and binds to GABA receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it decreases the likelihood that the postsynaptic neuron will fire an action potential because of the inhibitory nature of GABA receptors. For a condition like cerebral palsy in which some form of insult or damage has occurred to the brain, especially in the upper motor neurons, the result is hyperactive reflexes (as opposed to the calming sensation). At this point, muscle spasticity begins to become detectable. [</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6] </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from the biological mechanism underlying this condition, particularly significant environmental factors also gravely contributed to Sam’s condition. For eight months, my mother was carrying a normally developing fetus in the womb. However, a few weeks before Sam’s delivery date, my mother could not feel any fetal movement for about three days, so she went to check on it. As she was receiving the examination, Sam unexpectedly made a fluttering movement. If he had not moved, my mother would have had to get a Caesarean section immediately. Since he moved inside, the examiners found nothing to be wrong with the fetus and deemed it safe to send my mother home. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Just a few days later, my mom was rushed to the hospital after her labor pain started. At the time, the primary medical staff mostly consisted of medical interns still honing in on decision-making skills during critical situations.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">From the time of my mother’s arrival at the hospital, 13 hours passed before a team of doctors and interns determined that she needed a C-section. Once this decision was made, additional time was required by the medical professionals to prepare the room for surgery. All the while, my mom was in labor pain and, unbeknownst to her, the fetus had become separated from the placenta while the umbilical cord suffered damage. By the time the surgery finally ended, Sam had suffered from asphyxiation. According to the Cerebral Palsy Guide, “asphyxiation that occurs during labor or delivery may have been caused by medical malpractice or neglect. Early detachment of the placenta, a ruptured uterus during birth or the umbilical cord getting pinched in a way that restricts blood flow can cause oxygen deprivation.” [</span><span style="font-weight: 400">7]</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The most important aspect of a disease, once established and diagnosed, is treatment and therapy. Asking questions about how to manage pain, how to make daily routines easier to perform, and how to accommodate family members in raising a child with a disability all goes into the planning process of treatment as well. These individuals need more than mere pills in order to get through their daily lives. This is where therapists (i.e. occupational, behavioral, speech, physical, and vocational therapists) and related health advocates, including family members, come into play. While therapists cannot completely remove the condition, they provide a strategy to alleviate psychological symptoms, including feelings of loneliness, fear of who will care for you, or resentment towards oneself. Family psychologists can help children with cerebral palsy by providing an initial assessment in an attempt to gain more insight into the family dynamics. If there seems to be a lack of parental support or lack of child attachment, a family psychologist can address this through therapy sessions with the parents. Therapy sessions allow for parents to individually discuss what they think is working well for the child and other areas that can be improved. The parents are also free to talk about their own personal issues, permitting the psychologist to gain a better understanding of certain triggers for the parents. These triggers can affect caregiving for the child with special needs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Cerebral palsy is more than just a neurological condition. It is a way of life that, for Sam, is entangled in a web of personal, social, familial, caregiver and medical challenges. One noteworthy  concept heavily emphasized in the healthcare field today is the importance of a family-centered management model. The notion of a family-centered approach strives to improve the way of life for individuals with the condition in the family in a mutual way. For a family, it can be quite taxing physically and emotionally to have to take care of someone for the rest of their lives. While it is considerably easier for the receiver to reap the benefits of the caregiver, it is more difficult for the caregiver to constantly provide. The family-centered approach tries to find a middle ground where the caregiver or family and the care-receiver are benefitting from each other as much as possible. In a holistic family-centered model, the needs of each family member are taken into consideration. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A study by Susanne King details the role of pediatric neurologists, therapists, and family members, especially parents, in caring for children with cerebral palsy. This study mainly emphasizes the limiting restraints cerebral palsy places on individuals. For example, families with special needs children often have specific ways of communicating, specialized equipment used at home, and a support system consisting of the family members, therapists, and guidance counselors. The heavy emphasis on familial involvement with medical guidance from professionals is the root of family-centered care. King describes that “these children often have complex long-term needs that are best addressed by a family-centered service delivery model.”[8]</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Oftentimes, we see that those families who have disabled family members are suffering. Some parents, for example, experience great distress because they do not completely understand what is happening to their child and, thus, fail to acknowledge their limitations at times. Others feel that they are incapable of looking after their child but cannot bear the idea of sending them away to an institution. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">King also discusses the lack of investigation of families as a whole practicing care-giving. “Although there is much evidence supporting a family-centered approach in the area of parental outcomes, there has been little work reported on the family unit as a whole,” King writes. “The most common outcome is better psychological well-being for mothers (because they generally were the participants in most of the studies).”[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">8]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In my family, I can actively see family-centered management of my brother’s condition occurring. I see how both my parents have certain roles in my brother’s life that collectively enable or mobilize him to feel included and respected. I like to call my parents the arms and legs for my brother in a figurative sense, and I like to call myself the eyes for my brother. Working together to the best of our ability, we enable him to see the outside world in a way that’s similar to the way we experience it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">All my life, I have seen my mother perform the role of a caregiver. I have seen so many ups and downs in her situation, and I would always ask myself the following questions. What makes her get up every morning and continue to give the care she does? What makes her not give up? She told me, "I have faith in God, and I know that He creates pathways for me to deal with the physical implications of taking care of a disabled family member and see, I have never had any major problems with your brother. I will continue to give care for as long as my body will allow for me to do so.”[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1]</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Annemarie Mol and John Law of Duke University collaboratively published a research paper detailing how people are more than just the definitions of their disorders or conditions. According to Mol and Law, people actively create and construct their life in a way that either enhances or minimizes the intensity of their conditions. Mol and Law also explain that “there are boundaries around the body we do…so long as it does not disintegrate, the body-we-do hangs together. It is full of tensions, however.”[</span><span style="font-weight: 400">9]</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Their conclusion on what makes a person pull through encapsulates the reason my mother still continues to care for my brother.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The definition of cerebral palsy as a condition is very limited. Oftentimes people who have debilitating conditions are missing a network or a support system of people, that once established, can essentially improve that family member’s way of life. With the family-centered approach to managing care, one is essentially enabling the disabled family member by actively being a part of their life, including their day-to-day life activities. For example, through the support system we provide for Sam, he can feel that he is in good hands and that he has established emotional and personal security. Although his condition is permanent, it is comforting to know that our family dynamics allow for an environment in which he can thrive while remaining mentally healthy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> In this paper, I will be discussing reviews on patient activation level and health outcomes in chronic diseases. I wanted to analyze the effect patients can have on their own treatment plans and discuss how they can make a difference. I feel personally connected to this topic because my dad was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has been a role model for me in his journey of his treatment plan.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Patient involvement and education in their diagnosis is not a novel idea, but has been shown to play a role in overall patient experience [1, 2]. Chronic illnesses create responsibilities and demands on patients to manage and understand their care and diagnosis. It has been shown that chronic disease patients who take on a bigger role and engagement level with their own health have more positive outcomes [3]. Patient engagement or patient activation can be defined as “the individual’s knowledge, skill, and confidence for managing their own health” [3].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Patients who are more involved in their diagnosis and treatment have been shown to have more positive outcomes. One study used survey data from cancer patients and assessed how patient activation level affected actions taken on by the patient, communication with the doctor, and overall satisfaction with their care and treatment [3]. The study used survey data that was collected by CancerCare who sent out six different online surveys to cancer patients in order to test their patient activation measure [3]. The survey was sent out to a sample that consisted of those who were 25 years or older and had received a cancer diagnosis [3]. The study population varied in different characteristics and after controlling for demographics and health status factors, the study found that patients who scored higher in their activation level were 4.7 times more likely to start exercise and 3.3 times more likely to start a healthier diet when compared to patients who scored less in their activation level [3]. The study also found that less activated patients had a lower score in following their doctor’s recommendations, discussing side effects with their doctor, and in their overall satisfaction of their care received [3]. As discussed above, patients who scored higher on their activation level are more likely to be better informed on their treatment options and have greater proactivity in managing their condition [3].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There are a wide range of different factors that have been found to affect a patient's interest in participating in their health care decision-making. These factors are related to demographic, personal characteristics, ability to put time in, stage and severity of disease, and the influence from the practitioner [4]. There are many reasons not stated above why one may or may not involve themself in their own treatment decisions and plans. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Information about one’s diagnosis and care treatment is one of the ways in which a patient can educate themself. This information enables people to understand and exchange with their healthcare provider on consequential decisions [4]. Education of the disease has been shown to increase the patient’s willingness to ask questions because they are more confident in their understanding and therefore participate in a more active role in their treatment plan [4]. Decreasing the gap in education on their diagnosis also leads patients to better understand their own personal requirements with regard to their treatment and personalized treatment in terms of exercise and diet, and trust in their doctor to take their recommendations [4]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Patient education and proactiveness can even lead to a patient becoming a driver in their own diagnosis. In January of 2016, my dad was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia by a general hematologist and was put on a “watch and wait” approach. This approach essentially means that a patient’s condition is monitored without receiving any treatment until there is a change in symptoms [5]. This made sense for my dad since his cancer was slow moving and he did not have many symptoms. Around six months later, the hematologist said he needed to be treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR), which is a Cytotoxic Chemotherapy. The doctor gave no real explanation for why he had to be treated at that time and regarding FCR, he simply said “it’s the gold standard.” At this time, my dad had started to get connected with CLL support groups such as the CLL Society and decided to get a second opinion. Through the process of educating himself and receiving a second opinion, he realized there were many negative side effects that came with FCR that his doctor did not inform him about, and he would need his genetics tested to even see if he was compatible with the treatment. When he brought up his genetics to the doctor, the doctor responded saying he thought they already did that. My dad left the appointment feeling shocked and realizing he needed to be informed and educated on his treatment options if he wanted the best possible treatment. After doing genetic testing, he found over 50% of his cells were 17P deleted and he also had Trisomy 12. This meant his genetics would not be compatible with the treatment plan. It was becoming apparent to my dad that new non-cytotoxic treatments were superior for most CLL patients. He decided to take the initiative to continue to “watch and wait” and explore other options. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">After a couple of months, his symptoms started to progress and he got an appointment with a doctor at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) who told him that there was a clinical trial happening that could be a potential treatment option for his disease. Through his own research and the resources he found through the CLL Society website, support groups, and UCSD, he decided this was the right treatment for him. It was good that he chose to wait rather than take the initial treatment offered; if he chose the latter, he would have not qualified for the trial. He has been on the clinical trial with Venetoclax and Ibrutinib for about two years now and has shown normal numbers in terms of his white blood count, which is used to measure the presence of CLL. Through the resources provided to him, he was able to gain knowledge and connections with experts in the field to feel confident in his decision to find a treatment plan that worked for him. My dad is now very involved with the CLL Society and founded a local CLL support group in San Diego where they meet to discuss their experiences and bring in health professionals to lead discussions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">My dad’s personal story and the data shown above shows how imperative it is to do research and educate yourself on your own condition. It is critical to get your main information and opinions from your doctor, and to always consider a second opinion. Evidently, educating yourself on your own health and treatment plans can have beneficial effects overall, but it is critical to remember that doctors and health care professionals are trained in their field. It is very important to use your education and resources to find a specialist in your disease and start a conversation with them. Although you may not have all the resources in the beginning, the best advocate for your health and future is yourself. Use all the resources you can to continue to be informed and in touch with the professionals in the study of your disease. </span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Modern medicine relies on technologies that have barely changed over the past 50 years, despite all of the research that has been conducted on new drugs and therapies. Although medications save millions of lives every year, any one of these might not work for one person even if it works for someone else. With this paper, I hope to shed light on this new rising field and the lasting effects it can have on the human population.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Future of Modern Medicine</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Take the following scenario: You’re experiencing a persistent cough, a loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss to only then find an egg-like swelling under your arm. Today, a doctor would determine your diagnosis by taking a biopsy of your arm and analyzing the cells using the microscope, a 400-year-old technology. You have non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Today’s treatment plan for this condition is a generic one-size-fits-all chemotherapy with some combination of alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, and corticosteroids (just to name a few) that would be injected intravenously to target fast-dividing cells that can harm both cancer cells and healthy cells [1]. This approach may be effective, but if it doesn’t work, your doctor tells you not to despair - there are some other possible drug combinations that might be able to save you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Flash forward to the future. Your doctor will now instead scan your arm with a DNA array, a computer chip-like device that can register the activity patterns of thousands of different genes in your cells. It will then tell you that your case of lymphoma is actually one of six distinguishable types of T-cell cancer, each of which is known to respond best to different drugs. Your doctor will then use a SNP chip to flag medicines that won’t work in your case since your liver enzymes break them down too fast. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Tailoring Treatment to the Individual </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The latter case is one that we all wish to encounter if we were in this scenario. Luckily, this may be the case one day with the implementation of pharmacogenomics in personalized medicine. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This new field takes advantage of the fact that new medications typically require extensive trials and testing to ensure its safety, thus holding the potential as a new solution to bypass the traditional testing process of pharmaceuticals. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Even though only the average response is reported, if the drug is shown to have adverse side effects to any fraction of the population, the drug is immediately rejected. “Many drugs fail in clinical trials because they turn out to be toxic to just 1% or 2% of the population,” says Mark Levin, CEO of Millennium Pharmaceuticals [2]. With genotyping, drug companies will be able to identify specific gene variants underlying severe side effects, allowing the occasional toxic reports to be accepted, as gene tests will determine who should and shouldn’t get them. Such pharmacogenomic advances will more than double the FDA approval rate of drugs that can reach the clinic. In the past, fast-tracking was only reserved for medications that were to treat untreatable illnesses. However, pharmacogenomics allows for medications to undergo an expedited process, regardless of the severity of the disease. There would be fewer guidelines to follow because the entire population would not need to produce a desirable outcome. As long as the cause of the adverse reaction can be attributed to a specific genetic variant, the drug will be approved by the FDA [3]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Certain treatments already exist using this current model, such as for those who are afflicted with a certain genetic variant of cystic fibrosis. Additionally, this will contribute to reducing the number of yearly cases of adverse drug reactions. As with any field, pharmacogenomics is still a rising field and is not without its challenges, but new research is still being conducted to test its viability. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">With pharmacogenomic informed personalized medicine, individualized treatment can be designed according to one's genomic profile to predict the clinical outcome of different treatments in different patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [4]. Normally, drugs would be tested on a large population, where the average response would be reported. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">While this method of medicine relies on the law of averages, personalized medicine, on the other hand, recognizes that no two patients are alike </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[5]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Genetic Variants</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">By doubling the approval rate, there will be a larger variety of drugs available to patients with unique circumstances where the generic treatment fails. In pharmacogenomics, genomic information is used to study individual responses to drugs. Experiments can be designed to determine the correlation between particular gene variants with exact drug responses. Specifically, modern approaches, including multigene analysis or whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles, will assist in clinical trials for drug discovery and development [5]. SNPs are especially useful as they are genetically unique to each individual and are responsible for many variable characteristics, such as appearance and personality. A strong grasp of SNPs is fundamental to understand why an individual may have a specific reaction to a drug. Furthermore, SNPs can also be applied so that these genetic markers can be mapped to certain drug responses. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Research regarding specific genetic variants and their association with a varying drug response will be fundamental in prescribing a drug to a patient. The design and implementation of personalized medical therapy will not only improve the outcome of treatments but also reduce the risk of toxicity and other adverse effects. A better understanding of individual variations and their effect on drug response, metabolism excretion, and toxicity has the potential to replace the trial-and-error approach of treatment. Evidence of the clinical utility of pharmacogenetic testing is only available for a few medications, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels only require pharmacogenetics testing for a small number of drugs [6].</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Cystic Fibrosis: Case Study</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While this concept may seem far-fetched, a few select treatments have been approved by the FDA for certain populations, as this field of study promotes the development of targeted therapies. For example, the drug Ivacaftor was approved for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe. Those diagnosed with CF have a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, rendering the resulting CFTR protein defective. This protein is responsible for moving chloride to the cell surface, attracting water that will then generate mucus. However, those with the mutation have thick and sticky mucus, leaving the patient susceptible to germs and other infections as the bacteria that would normally be cleared [7]. Ivacaftor is only approved for CF patients who bear the specific G551D genetic variant, a specific mutation in the CFTR gene. This drug can then target the CFTR protein, increase its activity, and consequently improve lung function [8]. It’s important to note that the G551D is only just one genetic variant out of 1,700 currently known mutations that can cause CF.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Adverse Drug Reactions</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Pharmacogenomics also addresses the unknown adverse effects of drugs, especially for medications that are taken too often or too long. These adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are estimated to cost $136 billion annually. Additionally, within the United States itself, serious side effects from pharmaceutical drugs occur in 2 million people each year and may cause as many as 100,000 deaths, making it the fourth most common cause of death according to the FDA [9]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The mysterious and unpredictable side effects of various drugs have been chalked up to individual variation encoded in the genome and not drug dosage. Genetics also determines hypersensitivity reactions in patients who may be allergic to certain drugs. In these cases, the body will initiate a rapid and aggressive immune response that can hinder breathing and may even lead to a cardiovascular collapse [5]. This is just one of the countless cases where unknown patient hypersensitivity to drugs can lead to extreme outcomes. However, some new research in pharmacogenomics has shown that 80% of the variability in drugs can be reduced. The implications of this new research could mean that a significant amount of these ADRs could be significantly decreased inpatient management, leading to better outcomes [11].  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Challenges</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Pharmacogenomic informed medicine may suggest the ultimate demise of the traditional model of drug development, but the concept of targeted therapy is still in its early stages. One reason that this may be the case is due to the fact that most pharmacogenetic traits involve more than one gene, making it even more difficult to understand or even predict the different variations of a complex phenotype like a drug response. Through genome-wide approaches, there is evidence of drugs having multiple targets and numerous off-target results [4]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Even though this is a promising field, there are challenges that must be overcome. There is a large gap between integrating the primary care workforce with genomic information for various diseases and conditions as many healthcare workers are not prepared to integrate genomics into their daily practice. Medical school curriculums would need to be updated in order to implement information and knowledge regarding pharmacogenomics incorporated personalized medicine. This would also create a barrier in presenting this new research to broader audiences including medical personnel due to the complexity of the field and its inherently interdisciplinary nature [12]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The field has made important strides over the past decade, but clinical trials are still needed to not only identify the various links between genes and treatment outcome, but also to clarify the meaning of these associations and translate them into prescribing guidelines [4]. Despite its potential, there are not many examples where pharmacogenomics impacts clinical utility, especially since many genetic variants have not been studied yet. Nonetheless, progress in the field gives us a glimpse of a time where pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine will be a part of regular patient care.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Picasso Vasquez, Genetics and Genomics ‘20</strong>

<strong>Author’s Note:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> One of the main goals for my upper division UWP class was to write about a recent scientific discovery. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to write about CAR-T cell therapy because this summer I interned at a pharmaceutical company and worked on a project that involved using machine learning to optimize the CAR-T manufacturing process. I think readers would benefit from this article because it talks about a recent development in cancer therapy.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">“There's no precedent for this in cancer medicine.” Dr. Carl June is the director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies and the director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at the University of Pennsylvania. June and his colleagues were the first to use CAR-T, which has since revolutionized personal cancer immunotherapy [1]. “They were like modern-day Lazarus cases,” said Dr. June, referencing the resurrection of Saint Lazarus in the Gospel of John and how it parallels the first two patients to receive CAR-T.  CAR-T, or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell, is a novel cancer immunotherapy that uses a person’s own immune system to fight off cancerous cells existing within their body [1].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Last summer, I had the opportunity to venture across the country from Davis, California, to Springhouse, Pennsylvania, where I worked for 12 weeks as a computational biologist. One of the projects I worked on was using machine learning models to improve upon the manufacturing process of CAR-T, with the goal of reducing the cost of the therapy. The manufacturing process begins when T-cells are collected from the hospitalized patient through a process called leukapheresis. In this process, the T-cells are frozen and shipped to the manufacturing facility, such as the one I worked at this summer, where they are then grown up in large bioreactors. On day three, the T-cells are genetically engineered to be selective towards the patient’s cancer by the addition of the chimeric antigen receptor; this process turns the T-cells into CAR-T cells [2]. For the next seven days, the bioengineered T-cells continue to grow and multiply in the bioreactor. On day 10, the T-cells are frozen and shipped back to the hospital where they are injected back into the patient. Over the 10 days prior to receiving the CAR-T cells, the patient is given chemotherapy to prepare their body for inoculation of the immunotherapy [2]. This whole process is very expensive and as Dr. June put it in his TedMed talk, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">“it can cost up to 150,000 dollars to make the CAR-T cells for each patient.” But the cost does not stop there; when you include the cost of treating other complications, the cost “can reach one million dollars per patient” [1].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The biggest problem with fighting cancer is that cancer cells are the result of normal cells in your body gone wrong. Because cancer cells look so similar to the normal cells, the human body’s natural immune system, which consists of B and T-cells, is unable to discern the difference between them and will be unable to fight off the cancer. The concept underlying CAR-T is to isolate a patient's T-cells and genetically engineer them to express a protein, called a receptor, that can directly recognize and target the cancer cells [2]. The inclusion of the genetically modified receptor allows the newly created CAR-T cells to bind cancer cells by finding the conjugate antigen to the newly added receptor. Once the bond between receptor and antigen has been formed, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">the CAR-T cells become cytotoxic and release small molecules that signal the cancer cell to begin apoptosis [3].</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Although there has always been drugs that help your body's T-cells fight cancer, CAR-T breaks the mold by showing great efficacy and selectivity. Dr. June stated “27 out of 30 patients, the first 30 we treated, or 90 percent, had a complete remission after CAR-T cells.” He then goes on to sa</span><span style="font-weight: 400">y, “companies often declare success in a cancer trial if 15 percent of the patients had a complete response rate” [1].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As amazing as the results of CAR-T have been, this wonderful success did not happen overnight. According to Dr. June, “CAR T-cell therapies came to us after a 30-year journey, along with a road full of setbacks and surprises.” One of these setbacks is the side effects that result from the delivery of CAR-T cells. When T-cells find their corresponding antigen, in this case the receptor on the cancer cells, they begin to multiply and proliferate at very high levels. For patients who have received the therapy, this is a good sign because the increase in T-cells indicates that the therapy is working. When T-cells rapidly proliferate, they produce molecules called cytokines. Cytokines are small signaling proteins that guide other cells around them on what to do. During CAR-T, the T cells rapidly produce a cytokine called IL-6, or interleukin-6, which induces inflammation, fever, and even organ failure when produced in high amounts [3].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">According to Dr. June, the first patient to receive CAR-T had “weeks to live and … already paid for his funeral.”  When he was infused with CAR-T, the patient had a high fever and fell comatose for 28 days [1]. When he awoke from his coma, he was examined by doctors and they found that his leukemia had been completely eliminated from his body, meaning that CAR-T had worked. Dr. June reported that “the CAR-T cells had attacked the leukemia … and had dissolved between 2.9 and 7.7 pounds of tumor” [1].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although the first patients had outstanding success, the doctors still did not know what caused the fevers and organ failures. It was not until the first child to receive CAR-T went through the treatment did they discover the cause of the adverse reaction. Emily Whitehead, at six years old, was the first child to be enrolled in the CAR-T clinical trial [1]. Emily was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an advanced, incurable form of leukemia. After she received the infusion of CAR-T, she experienced the same symptoms of the prior patient. “By day three, she was comatose and on life support for kidney failure, lung failure, and coma. Her fever was as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit for three days. And we didn’t know what was causing those fevers” [1]. While running tests on Emily, the doctors found that there was an upregulation of IL-6 in her blood. Dr. June suggested that they administer Tocilizumab to combat increased IL-6 levels. After contacting Emily’s parents and the review board, Emily was given Tocilizumab and “Within hours after treatment with Tocilizumab, Emily began to improve very rapidly. Twenty-three days after her treatment, she was declared cancer-free. And today, she’s 12 years old and still in remission” [1]. Currently, two versions of CAR-T have been approved by the FDA, Yescarta and Kymriah, which treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) respectively [1].        </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The whole process is very stressful and time sensitive. This long manufacturing task results in the million-dollar price tag on CAR-T and is why only patients in the worst medical states can receive CAR-T [1]. However, as Dr. June states, “the cost of failure is even worse.” Despite the financial cost and difficult manufacturing process, CAR-T has elevated cancer therapy to a new level and set a new standard of care. However, there is still much work to be done. The current CAR-T drugs have only been shown to be effective against liquid based cancers such as lymphomas and non-effective against solid tumor cancers [4]. Regardless, research into improving the process of CAR-T continues to be done both at the academic level and the industrial level.</span>

<strong>By Nathan Levinzon, Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior ‘23</strong>

<strong>Author's Note: </strong>The purpose of this article is to introduce and inform the UC Davis scientific community of Folding@Home; a distributed computing project that allows individuals and researchers to donate computing resources from their computers towards COVID-19 research.

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Keywords:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> COVID-19, Folding@Home, Distributed Computing</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Reports of localized viral pneumonia cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan began in December 2019, initially amounting to little concern for humanity. Since then, the world has drastically changed as a result of COVID-19. As of September 16, 2020, almost thirty million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed across the globe, claiming the lives of close to one million individuals. In California alone, there have been seven hundred seventy thousand cases with close to twenty three thousand deaths as of September 28th [1]. Millions of individuals are currently under a government-mandated shelter-in-place order, forcing the lives of many to come to a standstill. In a statement made by UC Davis Chancellor May in March of this year, “much of [UC Davis’] research is ramping down, but when it comes to the coronavirus, our efforts continue apace” [2]. One such effort taking place at UC Davis is called Folding@Home (FAH), and it allows researchers to study the mechanisms of COVID-19 with nothing but a computer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FAH originated as a project to study how protein structures interact with their environment. Currently, some proteins of particular interest to FAH are the constituents of the virus that causes COVID-19. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four types of proteins: the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. Many copies of the spike protein protrude from the surface of the virus, where they wait to encounter Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of human cells [3]. In order to develop therapeutic antibodies or small molecules for the treatment of COVID-19, scientists need to better understand the structure of the viral spike protein and how it binds to the human enzymes required for viral entry into the cells.  Before the spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2 can function, they must first take on a particular structure, known as a ‘conformation’, through a process known as “protein folding.” As a result of the many factors that impact protein folding, like electrostatic interaction, especially the electrostatic interactions between amino acids and their environment,  research into therapeutics against COVID-19 first necessitates intensive computation in order to resolve protein structure [4]. Only after the proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are understood can the hunt for a cure begin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FAH is able to study the complex phenomena of protein folding thanks to the computational power of distributed computing. A distributed computing project is a piece of software that allows volunteers to “donate” computing time from the Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) located in their personal computers towards solving problems that require significant computing power, like protein folding. In essence, FAH uses a personal computer’s computational resources while the computer is idle to perform calculations involving protein folding. This donated computing power is what forms the “nodes” within a greater cluster of other computers in a process known as “cluster computing.” FAH uses the cluster’s resources to run complex biophysical computer simulations in order to understand the complexities and outcomes of protein folding [5]. In this way, FAH brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Studying protein folding via distributed computing has humble beginnings but has grown into a technology that has the potential to research even the most elusive proteins. First, established protein conformations are used by FAH as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories through a technique called ‘adaptive sampling.’ The theory behind adaptive sampling goes as follows: If a protein folds through the states A to B to C, researchers can calculate the length of the transition time between A and C by simulating the A to B transition and the B to C transition [6]. First, a computer simulates the initial conditions of a protein many times to determine the sample space of protein conformations. As the simulations discover more conformations, a Markov state model (MSM) is created and used to find the most dominant of protein conformations. The MSM represents a master equation framework: meaning that, in theory, the complete dynamics of a protein can be described using a single MSM [7]. The MSM method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids unnecessary computation and allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories [8]. The amount of time it takes to construct an MSM is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations running, i.e., the number of CPUs and GPUs available [9]. At the end of computation, an aggregate final model of all the sample states is generated. This final model is able to illustrate folding events and dynamics of the protein, which researchers can use to study and discover potential binding sites for novel therapeutic compounds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The power of FAH’s distributed computing in the hunt for a cure to COVID-19 grows with each computer on FAH’s network.ch citizen scientist who donates the power of their idle computer. Currently, pharmaceutical research in COVID-19 has been hindered by the fact that there are no obvious drug binding sites on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This makes developing therapeutic remedies for COVID-19 a long, expensive process of ‘check and guess.’ However, there is promise: in the past, FAH’s simulations have captured motions in the proteins of the Ebola virus that create a potentially druggable site not otherwise observable[10]. Using the same methodology as they did for Ebola, FAH has now found similar events in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hopes to use this result and future results to one day produce a life-saving treatment for COVID-19. By downloading Folding@Home and selecting to contribute to “Any Disease”, anyone can help provide FAH-affiliated researchers with the computational power required to tackle this worldwide epidemic.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>By</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> <strong>Aditi Venkatesh, Cognitive Science ‘21</strong></span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I wrote this piece for a UWP 104E assignment to explain the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. I chose to focus on mental health because it holds personal value to me and addresses an often overlooked aspect of this pandemic. I support the creation of more accessible mental health services and hope to encourage people to reflect on their own mental well-being during these unprecedented times.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Recall your life just a few months ago. Hanging out with friends at a restaurant. Working in an office and chatting with coworkers. Sitting in a classroom with hundreds of classmates. Visiting family members. Buying groceries without worrying about wiping everything down. Going for a walk with neighbors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Now, life looks a lot different. Zoom meetings all the time. FaceTime calls just to talk to friends and family. Paranoia about whether masks and gloves are covering your face and hands properly. Constantly checking social media for news. Using laptops every hour to communicate with classmates, coworkers, teachers, and pretty much anyone. The same routine repeated over and over again.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a much different world. The consequences of this pandemic are primarily examined from a medical and economic perspective, but more attention needs to be brought to the psychological impacts of this pandemic. Mental health disorders have become increasingly prevalent in society; data from Active Minds, a mental health awareness organization, states that 50% of the United States population will experience a mental health condition at some point during their lifetime [1]. These statistics become even more concerning for young adults, with 75% of all cases of mental health issues beginning by the age of 24 [1]. With new layers of stress, anxiety, and isolation stemming from the pandemic, mental health issues are more widespread than before. Through the remainder of this piece, I will articulate outcomes of COVID-19 including the general effect of a pandemic on mental health, specifically focusing on younger populations at risk for anxiety and depression. I discuss alternative positive outcomes in people who normally thrive in times of limited social interaction and contrast this with the harmful impact of drastic isolation. I examine the benefits and consequences of increased technology use during COVID-19. Lastly, I have provided a few helpful mental health resources for students, and I urge everyone to assess their own mental health during these difficult times and advocate for better mental health services.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The coronavirus pandemic has created a mental health crisis across the world. Quarantining and shelter-in-place guidelines have isolated most people from family and friends, reduced social interactions drastically, and disrupted normal interpersonal interaction as shown in Figure 1 below, with data collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation towards the end of March 2020 [2]. People were already experiencing negative impacts on their mental health at the onset of the pandemic in early March, so undoubtedly, the duration of quarantine has exacerbated prior conditions. Individuals who are practicing shelter-in-place were more likely to report feeling mild or severe negative impacts on mental health than those who are not sheltering-in-place. Negative impacts include stress, anxiety, and general disruptions to life such as job loss, isolation, and income insecurity. These effects are particularly noticeable in individuals that were already at a higher risk for depression prior to the pandemic: younger adolescents, frontline healthcare workers, and individuals with chronic illnesses.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>

Figure 1:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-3513 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/11/unnamed-e1605914473914.png" alt="" width="1280" height="668" />

<span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the isolation that comes with quarantining, we must recognize that levels of interpersonal dependence produce key vulnerabilities to depression and other comorbid mental health disorders. How much we depend on other relationships has strong implications on support systems, coping mechanisms to mental health issues, and willingness to seek treatment [3]. Prior research on psychosocial risk factors has shown that sociotropy and autonomy are two personality traits that predict depression. Sociotropy is the reliance on interpersonal relationships, while autonomy is related to independence and seeking self-control. A 2018 study conducted by Otani, et al. at the Yamagata School of Medicine in Japan found that sociotropy was associated with negative beliefs about oneself, but autonomy was associated with negative beliefs about others and short-lived positive beliefs about oneself [4]. These results highlight that dependence on others and an imbalance of self-esteem can be linked to depression. Since quarantining creates isolation, this isolation leads to an increased tendency to contemplate and overthink negative core beliefs about oneself, resulting in lower levels of confidence and self-esteem. We should be aware that certain personality traits are more vulnerable to depression during this pandemic and mental health needs to be prioritized more than ever before. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">However, one might wonder if autonomous individuals are thriving during this pandemic, since there is undoubtedly less social interaction than normal. For example, imagine a student that has mild social anxiety and does not enjoy their large classes in school. They might be relieved because they don’t have to have lengthy conversations with classmates and can independently complete their work. This very well may be the case for certain individuals. Previous studies have shown that autonomy can cultivate creativity, and introversion has been closely linked with autonomous tendencies [5]. Individuals that typically thrive in solitude and focus on hobbies, jobs, and other passions may find comfort in having more time to themselves due to COVID-19. Alternatively, extremely high levels of autonomy, such as complete disconnection from family and friends can be a factor that contributes to depression. This stresses the fact that a majority of individuals need some level of healthy social interaction to have a balanced life.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the finding of a correlation between isolation and depression, since the onset of the pandemic, people are finding creative ways to socially interact and combat the loneliness COVID-19 has created. Many folks schedule weekly or monthly calls with family and friends to catch up. Organizations are holding virtual discussions about mental health and ways to practice self-care. Students across the world are creating online board games and holding virtual game nights.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">However even with these alleviating factors, the magnitude and ongoing duration of the pandemic’s restrictions continue to foster unusually high levels of loneliness. Students who may have participated in many extracurricular activities (which are now canceled), can’t talk to their friends as much, feel out of the loop in their lives, and struggle to find ways to spend their free time. Loneliness is one feeling that can contribute to depression and anxiety. In Figure 2, among data collected by Healthline through a YouGov COVID-19 Tracker during April 2020, the age group most affected by depression and anxiety (33%) was adults younger than 35 years old [6]. Additionally, this younger population showed an increase of anxiety and depression over a two-week span from April 12th to April 26th. Lastly, 45% of the U.S. population tested showed anxiety and depression PHQ-4 values out of the normal range [6]. However, older populations reported a plateau or slight reduction, which may be due to less dramatic lifestyle changes or less technology use compared to younger generations. This is significant because it illustrates that younger adults, which includes most students, disproportionately face worsened mental health.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Figure 2:</span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-3514 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/11/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" />

<span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time in China, researchers found similar patterns of anxiety and depression and chose to analyze why this exacerbation was present in younger individuals. Many research studies in China, where the peak of COVID-19 has passed, are examining the psychological repercussions of the pandemic, with a focus on depression and anxiety. In a published study from April 2020, researchers in Wuhan, China measured that the prevalence of depression and anxiety in the general population was 35.1% and 20.1%, respectively [7]. Further analysis of the self-report questionnaire confirmed that individuals younger than 35 years old reported more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. In fact, among the younger population, those that spent more than 3 hours per day thinking about the pandemic faced more severe anxiety than those that spent 0-2 hours. This result highlights that in addition to actual lifestyle changes, thoughts about COVID-19 induces anxiety in young populations. This begs the question, why are younger people thinking about COVID-19 more than older people?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The answer is technology. Even though everyone uses technology, younger ages rely on technology more, especially for school and interacting with friends. Of course, technology is not all bad. In fact, society is most likely only able to function during this pandemic due to advancements like video conferencing, telemedicine, and online social groups. However, another study conducted in Wuhan, China explored the use of social media during the recovery interventions placed after the peak of COVID-19 [8]. Researchers found that social media support groups slightly reduced depression. But more significantly, adults that spent more than 2 hours on COVID-19 news on social media had increased anxiety and depression. Another study in Chicago in May 2020 explored the role of mainstream media in coronavirus news and depression. Researchers found that greater exposure to COVID-19 news, through cable news channels like CNN, local news channels, and the New York Times, led to higher perceived vulnerability to COVID-19, and this was strongly correlated with depressive symptoms [9]. Social media and mainstream media sources can both produce an undue burden on individuals through a barrage of stressful information about COVID-19 and lead to greater anxiety and depression.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Another form of technology, while useful for work and school, has unintended negative consequences: video conferencing. People have started to refer to these downsides as “Zoom fatigue” [10]. Zoom fatigue is the phenomenon where people are more tired and stressed with online meetings compared to in-person ones. I am sure many readers have experienced the similar stresses of looking presentable, awkward silences when nobody is speaking, and simply, less fun meetings. During Zoom meetings, it is difficult to discern normal social cues, such as body language and eye contact, over a video. This nonverbal communication is crucial to making conversations run smoothly. Removal of many social cues makes video calls feel impersonal. It can make even a catch-up video call to your best friend seem stressful. Additionally, previous research has shown that when responding online, even delays of up to 1.2 seconds can make a person seem unfocused and unfriendly [10]. These slight technological delays can dramatically contribute to greater stress and anxiety. Zoom fatigue can be especially taxing on younger populations that are still in school and are constantly in and out of Zoom meetings for courses.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, society finds itself at crossroads. How do we balance the positive and negative impacts of the technology use? Obviously, we cannot simply get rid of Zoom meetings and online classes; however, this pandemic gives us a crucial opportunity to expand online mental health services. Past research on mental health effects during the 2003 SARS epidemic in China showed similar prevalence of worsened mental health, with 48% of the participants reporting deteriorated mental health because of the SARS epidemic through anxiety and depression; this is very similar to the 47% found in the 2020 KFF study [11, 2]. If mental health issues are just as exacerbated in our pandemic 15 years later even with greater technological advancements, it accentuates the disparities in accessible online mental health care. Increasing virtual therapy appointments, online support groups, and videos for stress-relieving techniques like meditation, breathing exercises, and self-reflection are some starting points.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A CDC study conducted in June 2020, several months following the onset of the pandemic, found that people aged 18-24 years still face the highest prevalence of mental health conditions [12]. However, 30.9% of all participants showed anxiety and depression symptoms above normal PHQ-4 measurements; this illustrates a reduction compared to the finding of 45% measured in the April 2020 Healthline survey [12, 6]. Most importantly, I hope this shows that things are getting better. I especially encourage all readers to reflect on how to better take care of their own mental health. It is so important to practice self-care, which can be different for everyone! This can be exercising, seeing a therapist, hanging out with friends, getting more sleep, or setting boundaries for your own capabilities. It’s okay to prioritize your mental health when things get overwhelming. Therapy can be helpful for some folks, so here are some resources to be aware of. Student Health and Counseling Services offers on-campus counseling appointments for students (call (530) 732-0871 or visit hem.ucdavis.edu to schedule). Free tele-mental health and online counseling appointments are offered through Therapy Assistance Online (visit taoconnect.org and sign up with your UC Davis email). Text RELATE to 741741 to chat live with a crisis counselor, available 24/7 through the Crisis Text Line. Lean on your support systems and know that you are not alone! Mental health is just as important as your physical health. I hope we can take this time to acknowledge the mental health crisis this pandemic has created by improving available mental health services and making mental healthcare more accessible for at-risk populations.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Reshma Kolala, Microbiology ‘22</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> Adolescents are notorious for not getting enough sleep, but can that impact how the cells of our immune system operate? The following study reinforces the significance of maintaining a natural sleep schedule in adolescents and unveils a new area of research where sleep-wake patterns could be used as a diagnostic when screening for respiratory illnesses.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Our circadian rhythm regulates a myriad of biological activity, ranging from metabolism and cell signaling pathways to various psychological and behavioral patterns. The circadian rhythm is defined as endogenous (built-in mechanism) and entrainable (adjusted to external stimuli such as temperature and light) [1]. Together, these factors manifest into a unique chronotype which describe an individual's propensity to sleep and wake at a particular time [2]. Recent studies have examined this biological pattern in relation to respiratory illness, revealing how </span><span style="font-weight: 400">disruption in the circadian rhythm plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation and physiology. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The following study aims to further elucidate the relationship between an individual’s chronotype and their susceptibility to asthma or allergic diseases, particularly in the adolescent population. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The study conducted by Halder et al. analyzed data from 1684 adolescents, ranging from ages 13-14, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">from the Prevalence and Risk Factors of Asthma and Allergy-Related Diseases among Adolescents (PERFORMANCE) study. Each individual was administered the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase III questionnaire to determine each adolescent’s disp</span><span style="font-weight: 400">osition to respiratory illness, with particular emphasis on wheeze, rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and asthma. This data was analyzed against responses from the reduced Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ), which was used to determine each participant’s chronotype. An individual’s chronotype was classified into one of three categories: morning, evening and intermediate types. Exte</span><span style="font-weight: 400">rnal factors such as demographics, social characteristics, and neighborhood environment (rural, industrial suburban, nonindustrial suburban and urban) were also considered as potential influences that may enhance asthma/allergy symptoms. Results revealed that an “individual’s chronotype was associated with respiratory symptoms among adolescents”. More specifically, those that were evening types, and intermediate types to a lesser extent, had a higher risk of current wheeze and current or ever rhinitis when compared to morning types. Intermediate types also demonstrated higher levels of Rhinoconjunctivitis when compared to morning types. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, individuals that were identified as evening types had a consistently higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms when compared to morning types.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Those identified as morning types did not exhibit significant correlation with respiratory symptoms. This association between respiratory symptoms and chronotype was paralleled, though to a lower degree, in individuals identified as intermediate types as well [3]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The wide pathophysiology of asthma and allergy makes it challenging to pinpoint a particular cellular process to explain this finding [4]. Previous studies have shown that asthma/allergy symptoms worsen at night which can be attributed to multiple immunological factors. A study by Christ et al. in 2018 observed the link between mast cell responsiveness, function in allergic diseases, and the circadian rhythm. Mast cells possess a high affinity for IgE antibody, which is produced by the immune system in response to allergen recognition. When activated by bound IgE, mast cells release chemokines, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators such as histamine, which exhibit diurnal character (are active during the daytime). This study illustrates how mast cell signaling, critically involved in the inflammatory response, operates on a circadian rhythm. This is due to the fact that inflammatory mediators are governed by diurnal (active during the day) behavior. [5]. This study focused on mast cell signaling by Christ et al. may provide some reasoning behind the results observed in the aforementioned study conducted by Halder et al. The Christ et al. study shows how dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle interferes with how the immune system responds to the presence of allergens, which could potentially aggravate the respiratory symptoms detailed in the Halder et al. study. For example, those identified as “evening-types” are “more easily prone to circadian misalignments that could eventually lead to circadian clock dysfunction which triggers several down-stream mechanisms including altered immune systems in the lungs”.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Melatonin production is also a significant factor in the inflammatory immune response. Evening type individuals are exposed to higher levels of artificial light at night (ALAN) which disrupts daily rhythms and suppresses nocturnal melatonin production [6]. Melatonin, known as the sleep hormone, plays a vital role in immunomodulation. Immunomodulation is responsible for orchestrating the events of cellular and humoral immunity [7]. Recent studies have identified melatonin as a key player in asthma and allergy-related disease when the circadian rhythm is misregulated by abnormal sleep-wake patterns. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This study is the first to find an association between chronotype and respiratory symptoms in adolescents</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. As this is a cross-sectional study, researchers in this study are unable to make a causal statement that directly links sleeping patterns to respiratory illness. However, results from this study warrant further investigation into the cellular and behavioral effects of individuals who possess “intermediate” and “evening type” chronotypes. This finding uncovers a new outlet of healthcare, where an individual’s unique chronotype is utilized as a tool in patient diagnosis for various metabolic, behavioral, and respiratory illnesses.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Vishwanath Prathikanti, Political Science ‘23</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s note:</strong> As an undergraduate researcher at UC Davis, I have planned and executed a study in chemistry education and now am in the process of presenting findings. This experience sparked my interest in how students learn and what detriments there are to obtaining education. As a student, I was interested in learning what social isolation does to our brains and how it affects our education.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">In the current Covid-19 pandemic, the norm in terms of education has been virtual classes and recorded lectures. In the interest of safety, schools have closed lecture halls, minimized the number of students staying in a single dorm, and generally encouraged students to avoid contact with others. While these steps are all necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19, they also contribute to student loneliness, which severely hampers learning.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Why do we feel lonely right now?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When discussing social isolation today, we might find ourselves asking if we truly are “isolated.” Schools all across the country use Zoom to facilitate discussions and classes that would normally be in-person. Outside of the learning environment, many try to stay connected with friends and family via virtual meeting spaces to watch TV or play games together. However, being socially isolated isn’t necessarily about the number of interactions, but rather the quality of interactions. Hawkley et al. state that “Perceptions are critical ... People can live rather solitary lives and not feel lonely, or they can have many social relationships and nevertheless feel lonely” [1]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This is coupled with the fact that historically, college students have been more prone to feelings of loneliness compared to the general populace. Diehl et al. were some of the first to study loneliness in college with an emphasis on transition-related causes, such as moving out for the first time or the formation of new relationships, and concluded that transitions naturally led to loneliness [2]. And indeed, the transition from in-person learning to online learning has been documented to have caused loneliness as well. Killgore et al. studied over 3,000 adults in the first three months of the Covid-19 pandemic [3].  The loneliness scores were calculated via a set of online questionnaires including the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [3].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly, even when communities started to reopen and participants noted that their “sheltering-in-place” was decreasing, their loneliness scores increased significantly from April to May 2020 and eventually plateaued in June, which was attributed to participants adjusting to their situations [3]. Diehl et al. speculated that “[refraining] from handshakes, hugs, and pats on the back,” long-held social behaviors to express closeness “have been radically altered,” leading to the continuation of loneliness even as we re-enter communities [3]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">physical touch has been shown to have an important link to loneliness, and even those who are socializing with others, or wouldn’t categorize themselves as lonely, still suffer if they are not touching others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> In a study conducted in May 2020, Tejada et al. tested people to see if human touch would affect their feelings of loneliness despite belonging to a culture described as “individualistic” [4]. Tejada et al. explained that individualistic cultures, such as Anglo-Saxon societies, stress independence and neglect physical contact. They found that participants’ loneliness scores generally decreased when they were given a small oil rub by researchers [4]. They calculated the scores using heart rate, questionnaires, and an emotional recognition test [4]. The study essentially proves that even individuals who may view a lack of touch as normal, or those who normally have limited social interaction with others, still feel lonely without direct human contact.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Cognitive decay linked to loneliness</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Now that we have established that social isolation leads to a general increase in loneliness, it is important to illustrate the link between loneliness and cognitive decay, which is negatively impacting students’ ability to learn. Cacioppo and Hawkley documented that, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in addition to physical health problems such as increased blood pressure, increased levels of stress, and a decrease in physical activity, loneliness also contributes to various mental problems, such as a decrease in IQ and an increase in the risk of Alzheimer’s disease</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [5]. While Cacioppo noted that these mental problems were mostly observed in the elderly, there was evidence to suggest that loneliness early on would lead to changes in IQ levels over a lifetime. In young adults specifically, Cacioppo. et al. witnessed in a separate study that lonelier people tend to get more distracted and have a harder time focusing compared to people who did not feel lonely, indicating the lonelier people may have experienced cognitive decay [6].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">So how are we supposed to avoid this cognitive and physical decay? According to Dr. Maggie Mulqueen in a PBS interview, we should practice social distancing, but make a more conscious effort to reach out to people and avoid social isolation. “We need to respect social distancing and hand-washing as our best means right now to save ourselves physically. But we need to really shore people up against social isolation,” she said [7]. Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases and vice chairman of the department of medicine at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, Massachusetts, acknowledged the need for touching one another, and encouraged people to plan demonstrations of affection, even something as simple as a hug, in advance [8]. While it is important to minimize the spread of Covid-19, it is also important to maintain our own mental wellbeing and avoid isolating ourselves socially.</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I heard about this therapy during a freshman seminar, and I presented on this during that class. This article is an adaptation of that presentation. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">ADA-SCID is a rare, autosomal recessive disease that cripples one's immune system. ADA SCID stands for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency due to Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency, which occurs due to a mutation in the ADA gene [1]. This gene normally assists in the production and regulation of lymphocytes, also known as white blood cells [1]. Specifically, ADA (Adenosine Deaminase) breaks down deoxyadenosine, which is toxic to lymphocytes [2]. In the absence of a working ADA gene, this deoxyadenosine collects in the body and continues to degrade lymphocytes. Eventually, the lack of functioning lymphocytes leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) [2].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">ADA-SCID is typically screened for at birth and has a variety of treatment options. The most common treatment is a bone marrow transplant from a sibling. In this process, stem cells are taken from someone with a matching blood type, and transplanted into the patient, with the hope that these cells will proliferate and produce healthy lymphocytes [3]. While this approach is effective approximately 70% of the time, the real challenge is in matching a patient to a donor. Because the patient’s immune system is already so impacted, there is a high possibility of rejection of the transplant. Additionally, for patients who do not have a sibling or someone in the family who is able to donate, finding a match can be incredibly difficult.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">For patients unable to have a transplant, enzyme therapy is also a possible form of treatment [3]. Enzyme Replacement Therapy, ERT, is simply providing the patient with a working copy of an enzyme, ADA in this case [4]. The drawback to this form of treatment is that it requires a patient to be dependent on a hospital for their entire lives. They cannot travel too far away from a hospital for too long, because if they miss a delivery of the enzyme, there can be drastic consequences [5]. Additionally, ERT can lose effectiveness over the years [4].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The third, and still experimental, treatment option is a gene therapy known as Strimvelis [6]. Strimvelis is one of the first gene therapy products to be used anywhere in the world. While it has yet to be approved by the FDA in the United States, it marks a milestone in the development of personalized medicine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Strimvelis treatment has three steps, starting with harvesting hematopoietic stem cells (HCS’s)  from the patient. These cells carry the mutated ADA gene and are ineffective at supporting catalyzing deoxyadenosine. Once extracted, the corrected ADA gene is delivered to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">HCSs </span><span style="font-weight: 400">in an ex vivo environment using a gammaretrovirus [7]. Once the cells have been transformed, they are delivered back to the patient using an IV drip, and take hold in the body, subsequent to a dose of Busulfan or Melphalan [8]. These two chemotherapy drugs are intended to kill any remaining damaged HCS’s in the body, allowing for the corrected cells to grow without interference. Once injected, the corrected cells will continue to proliferate, producing a healthy amount of ADA. The reason this therapy works well is that the patient’s own HCS’s are used, so there is little to no risk of rejection by the body’s immune system. Another key advantage to using Strimvelis is that it is a single treatment. Once the corrected HCS’s are delivered to the body, the patient is considered “cured” and is no longer reliant on any medical procedures to maintain their immunity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The results of Strimvelis trials have been incredibly promising. A clinical trial conducted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) found Strimvelis to have a 100% success rate, leading to its approval by the European Commission about one month later [9]. However, there have been rare cases of Strimvelis leading to patients developing T-cell leukemia [10]. These cases have led to the parent company of Strimvelis, Orchard Therapeutics, halting all administration of Strimvelis until an investigation on the possibly cancerous effects of Strimvelis has been completed [11].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Another primary drawback of Strimvelis is its cost. Strimvelis costs 594,000 euros per patient, which is equivalent to approximately 650,000 dollars [12]. While Strimvelis is not the most expensive gene therapy on the market, the cost is still incredibly restrictive, as the average middle-class family would not be able to afford this treatment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The reason the cost for this treatment is so high is that ADA-SCID is considered an orphan disease. Orphan diseases are conditions that affect under 200,000 people worldwide [13], which means that from the perspective of a pharmaceutical company, it is not cost-effective to develop a treatment. ADA-SCID only affects around 350 people worldwide [2]. Therefore, the cost per patient is high, since there are not that many people affected by this disorder and because the therapy cannot be mass-produced.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Strimvelis is not perfect, by any means. There are still thousands of unknowns surrounding gene editing, and the side effects are dramatic. Even with Strimvelis on the market, it is not the number one treatment option for most ADA-SCID patients. Nevertheless, it is a step forward. In a world where we learn more about our genetics every day, Strimvelis is a milestone in the development of personalized medicine. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Mari Hoffman, Genetics &amp; Genomics ‘21</strong>

<strong>Author's note: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrote this literature review for an assignment in UWP104E, Writing in Science. I chose this topic because my mom recently got diagnosed with ovarian cancer and I wanted to use this opportunity to learn more about the literature surrounding ovarian cancer and more specifically the latest research in diagnostics and treatments of ovarian cancer. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Eighty percent of ovarian cancers are diagnosed at a late stage of either three or four [1,2]. This is due to the nature of the disease to appear asymptomatic in many women, preventing early diagnosis [3,4].  Early diagnosis is also difficult to obtain due to the lack of biomarkers with high sensitivity and effective diagnostic testing for early disease detection [2,4]. New diagnostics markers and techniques are being developed such as the use of circRNAs, which are single-stranded circular mRNA transcripts, [3] and novel biomarkers such as ROMA and RMI [4]. The common late state diagnosis of the disease contributes to the fact that ovarian cancer also has the highest mortality rate among gynecological cancers [2,4,5]. Ovarian cancer represents the 7th most common cancer [2] and women in the United States have an average lifetime risk of 1.3% of developing ovarian cancer [1].  Ovarian cancer encompasses a larger group of malignancies that vary in origin, grade, and histology [1,2,6]. Although for the purpose of this review, when discussing ovarian cancer, I am referring to the most common type which is high-grade serous ovarian cancer [1,2,6,7].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Initial treatment of Ovarian cancer typically starts with either cytoreductive surgery or platinum-based chemotherapy, depending on the degree of the cancer spread. The combination of the two treatments, regardless of the order, has been the standard of care (SOC) for ovarian cancer [2,7]. Although most patients respond initially to this SOC treatment, the rate of recurrence of ovarian cancer is around 70 percent [2,5,7]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the high rate of recurrence, the advancement of novel and targeted treatment is needed.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> It is important to consider the disease's genetic features and molecular profile to understand the targeted therapies that are available to those with ovarian cancer. Some of the most promising targeted treatments have been with the use of PARP inhibitors [2,5,7]. Other targeted therapies are under exploration to be used in conjunction with chemotherapy such as Bevacizumab [2,7]. This review will examine and evaluate the current options and limitations of diagnostic screening and explore secondary treatments of ovarian cancer.</span>

<b>Diagnostics of Ovarian Cancer</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Overview and Limitations of Current Diagnostic Techniques</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Diagnostic testing and screening play an extremely important role in ovarian cancer prognostics because the earlier the cancer is found, the higher the likelihood of the patient having a positive outcome [4,8]. Cancer prognostics predict the likely course of a disease. Unfortunately, there are no highly effective biomarkers that are used preventively in the diagnostics of ovarian cancer [2,4,8,9].  The most common method for the detection of ovarian cancer is the use of transvaginal ultrasonography and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) level measurement  [1,3,4].  CA125 is a membrane glycoprotein antigen that has elevated expression levels in ovarian cancer [2,4]. CA125 is not very effective for early detection of ovarian cancer, such as stage 1, as the sensitivity of CA125 is reported to be under 50% [8]. CA125 sensitivity was found to be around 80-90% in the advanced stage of the disease [4]. Although CA125 has downfalls as a diagnostic marker, it is also used as a prognostic marker to assess response to treatment and recurrence of the disease [2,6]. Transvaginal ultrasonography has been shown to be a more useful diagnostic technique overall when used in combination with CA125 testing due to the high rate of false positives [4,10]. The false positives come from the low specificity of the ultrasound to be able to detect malignant versus benign abnormalities. Also, transvaginal ultrasonography is not always able to detect a tumor prior to metastasis [10]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Since there is no single biomarker that is highly effective in detecting ovarian cancer, detection markers have been combined and used algorithmically for higher sensitivity and specificity. It is important to understand that these tests are not true diagnostic tests, but are used to determine the likelihood of malignancy and the extent of the spread of the disease [8,9]. Some examples of algorithms being used for diagnostic testing are the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) [9] and Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) [8]. RMI is a mathematical formula that incorporates information from CA125 levels, ultrasounds findings, and menopausal status to quantify a score that is used to evaluate the risk of malignancy [8].  ROMA is a new algorithm that was proposed in 2009 that combines the use of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and CA125 levels [8,9]. HE4 is overexpressed in serous ovarian cancer with a sensitivity of around 76.5% when it is combined with CA125 [4,8]. The ROMA algorithm was a significant improvement in initial diagnostic testing compared to single biomarker tests because of the increase in sensitivity, but is typically not used until a symptom or sign of ovarian cancer is present [8,9]. Overall, there is currently a combination of biomarkers that are used for diagnostic and prognostics of ovarian cancer yet there is a need for higher specificity and sensitivity of these tests. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">With more sensitive biomarkers, diagnosis of ovarian cancer before the presence of the disease would yield a much better prognosis for patients.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Novel Diagnostic Testing</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the diagnostic testing described above are protein-based markers. More recent research explores the use of nucleic acids as novel serum markers, which have the potential to yield higher specificity and sensitivity than protein-based biomarkers [9]. One specific kind of nucleic acid that is being explored for the use of diagnostics in ovarian cancer is microRNA (miRNA), a noncoding and single-stranded molecule that ranges from 20-22 nucleotides in length. They are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes which impact a variety of factors relating to cell development, differentiation, and growth. [11,12]. In ovarian cancer, it has been found that miRNAs can play many different roles. Elevated expression levels of certain miRNAs have been associated with tumor progression and are a potential option as a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker [13,14]. Panels of miRNAs have been shown to discriminate between patients with malignant versus benign ovarian disease. A smaller subgroup of these miRNAs can even be used in association with lymph node metastasis and identification of stage three or four presentations of the disease. There is also a correlation between upregulation of certain miRNAs and serum CA125 values [13]. There is a diagnostic value of using miRNAs for the detection of ovarian cancer and is a novel area of research that brings hope to diagnostics of ovarian cancer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> Another novel diagnostic biomarker that is being investigated is the use of circRNAS. CircRNAs are single-stranded circular mRNA transcripts that are a part of the family of long noncoding RNAs. They were originally thought to be functionless byproducts of RNA splicing until they were discovered to play a regulatory role in the progression of tumors found in cancers. In ovarian cancer, circRNAs act primarily as a miRNA sponge, binding to miRNA and therefore inhibiting it from carrying out its desired function. This function contributes to and regulates ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The elevation of circRNAs in the sera of patients with ovarian cancer shows the potential of circRNA to be an effective diagnostic marker due to its high abundance and stability in ovarian cancer tissues. CircRNA is more stable than linear RNA because it is covalently closed, not containing a  5’ cap or poly-A tail [3,15]. Further research is needed to be done to fully understand the role of circRNAs in ovarian cancer, but the current research shows the great potential of circRNAs to be used as a diagnostic marker. </span>

<b>Current Treatment of Ovarian Cancer</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Standard of Care and Limitations</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The standard of care (SOC) in the medical world is the treatment process that a physician would advise based on the current knowledge and research surrounding the disease.  The treatment of ovarian cancer is personalized to the patient depending on the extent of the spread of the disease. There are defined SOC protocols for each of the varying stages of ovarian cancer. If ovarian cancer is found in the early and localized stage, the SOC is to do surgery in an attempt to eliminate the cancer cells present in the area. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer is most commonly diagnosed in the advanced stage. The SOC of advanced-stage ovarian cancer is to conduct surgery if possible and platinum-based chemotherapy. The guidance of whether to start with surgery or chemotherapy is based on whether there is evidence of metastatic disease or not. If there is no evidence of metastatic disease, it is recommended to first undergo surgery. Surgery is primarily used when the cancer is limited to the abdomen area and is localized.  However, if the disease has metastasized then typically chemotherapy is the first line of defense [2,7,16]. The ability of surgery to reduce the likelihood of residual disease when the cancer has spread remains controversial. The most important factor in surgery having a positive impact is the extent that the disease has spread. It is found that if patients have a low or moderate disease preoperatively, compared to extensive, then the approach to start with surgery remains important [17].</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Platinum-Based Therapy</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A hallmark of cancer is that cells are able to divide rapidly and evade normal cell death. Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs that kill rapidly dividing cells. The use of platinum-based carboplatin and taxol to treat advanced ovarian cancer is the standard [16,17]. This standard chemotherapy consists of intravenous carboplatin and taxol every three weeks. Another treatment option that is being explored is a dose-dense therapy regimen. This type of therapy gives the same dose of intravenous chemotherapy compared to standard chemotherapy, but with less time in between the intervals. The idea is that highly aggressive cancers, like ovarian cancers, could have less regrowth if there are shorter cycles in between treatments. Although there is support in real-world data that dose-dense therapy improves overall survival, randomized trials found no significant difference [18,2]. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ifosfamide-based Therapy</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Ifosfamide-based regimens are also used in current treatments of ovarian cancer. Ifosfamide is in the nitrogen mustard family of medications which was the first chemotherapy drug. Patients can be chemotherapy-sensitive or chemotherapy-resistant. Having sensitivity towards a chemotherapy treatment means that the patient’s cancer is responsive to the chemotherapy treatment.  It has been demonstrated that patients are more sensitive to ifosfamide-based regimens as opposed to platinum-based therapies. Although there is higher sensitivity to the treatment, ifosfamide-based therapy has a higher toxicity effect than platinum-based therapies. The patient’s response to platinum-based chemotherapy is typically assessed first and ifosfamide therapy can be used if there is no response to platinum-based chemotherapy [16,20].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The prognosis of patients with advanced ovarian cancer even with the SOC remains poor. As mentioned previously, the late-stage diagnosis of the disease and high recurrence rate leaves therapeutic strategies to treat ovarian cancer a challenge</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [19].</span>

<b>Novel Targeted Therapies</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, targeted treatments are used as second-line therapy for ovarian cancer. This is due to the recent and novel use of targeted therapies in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Targeted agents have only been used in clinical trials relatively recently compared to the SOC treatments of ovarian cancer. Due to this reason, and the aggressive nature of ovarian cancer, targeted therapies are typically only used as a secondary treatment [2, 7,16]. There is recent research indicating the potential use of targeted therapies as a first-line treatment, but more research is needed at this time in order to establish targeted therapies as a new standard of care [5,7].</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">PARP inhibitors</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">BRCA ½ mutations are present in about 18% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and guide what treatment options are available. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are tumor suppressor genes and are involved in the repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB) through the use of the error-free Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway. If an individual has a mutation in BRCA ½ then the error-prone nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is used to repair the DSBs and can result in the formation of cancer cells. PARP inhibition is a treatment option that is targeted for individuals harboring the BRCA ½ mutation. Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) are enzymes that function to repair single-stranded breaks (SSBs) in DNA through the use of the Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway. When PARP is inhibited, the repair of the SSBs in DNA can not be completed which results in the formation of DSBs at the replication fork. This formation is toxic to the cell and when not resolved, it causes cell death. It has been found that when a patient has a BRCA mutation or PARP inhibition independently, there are no detrimental effects to the cells. It is when there is a combination of a BRCA mutation and PARP inhibition, that there is no recovery of the cell and the cell demonstrates a synthetic lethality phenotype [5,7].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The first PARP inhibitor to be approved for patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations with high-grade ovarian cancer was Olaparib. It has been approved for patients who have undergone three or more first-line treatment of chemotherapy and for patients who are undergoing maintenance therapy after having a complete or partial response to platinum chemotherapy. Patients who are using Olaparib as maintenance therapy do not have to have BRCA1/2 mutation status, although there is a higher objective response rate in those who are BRCA1/2 mutated. The proportion of patients who have had a cancer-free event when using Olaparib twice daily compared to a placebo show a significant increase in overall survival.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> PARP inhibitors open up a new paradigm of treatments for patients with ovarian cancer and are currently undergoing clinical trials as a first-line treatment</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [5,7].</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bevacizumab</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Bevacizumab, also known as Avastin, is a monoclonal antibody that has been used as a treatment for ovarian cancer in conjunction with carboplatin and taxol chemotherapy. It is also an anti-angiogenesis agent that acts to prevent carcinogenesis by inhibiting the creation of new blood vessels for the cancer. Randomized trials have shown improved progression-free survival rates with the addition of Bevacizumab to the standard chemotherapy. Although findings support that there is no overall survival rate increase with the addition of Bevacizumab [21], there are also additional toxicities from Bevacizumab such as hypertension and delayed wound healing [7]. These are all important factors to consider when evaluating treatment options.  </span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Ovarian cancer today remains the deadliest disease among gynecological malignancies [2,4,5]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.  This review highlights the critical importance for researchers to create more effective diagnostics for earlier detection of the disease and cancer in general. The future of diagnostics is moving towards personalized testing and screenings of multiple types of cancers based on unique genetic profiles. While there are many novel targeted therapies being explored, it is imperative that the research on treatments of the disease continue to evolve and improve. Although the diagnosis of ovarian cancer remains serious, there is hope that the use of novel diagnostic techniques and targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors and Bevacizumab, improves the outcomes of patients with the disease. </span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> For as long as I can remember I wanted to attend medical school and become a pediatrician. More recently, I have been exposed to the study of epigenetics, which has unveiled the importance of prioritizing prevention of disease and furthered my interest in the field of medicine. In hopes of practicing internal medicine in the future, I wanted to investigate how providing care and support to the patient on an individualized level is crucial for effective treatment in the long term. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Put simply, epigenetics means “on top of” genetics, derived from the Greek prefix “epi.” Epigenetics describes the relationship between one’s gene activity and their environment, whereby the activity of the genes is altered but the DNA sequence is not directly modified. Genes can be turned “on” or “off” and changes to our epigenome are fortunately reversible. Researchers studying this phenomenon have been trying to answer the following questions: how does our knowledge of epigenetics help to further advance the study of illness and disorders, such as cancer and schizophrenia? How can understanding this phenomenon help scientists, doctors and researchers provide personalized care for patients?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Epigenetic changes, which impact our phenotype without directly affecting our genotype, have been previously tied to aging, our environment and even lifestyle [1]. Prenatal and early postnatal environmental factors have influenced an offspring’s risk and vulnerability to developing a health condition [2]. For instance, in the 1940s, children who were born during a period of increasing famine had exceedingly greater rates of coronary heart disease after maternal exposure to famine, as opposed to those not exposed. This was linked to a decrease in DNA methylation</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">an epigenetic alteration</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">of the gene responsible for insulin growth [2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">These epigenetic modifications continue to take place throughout an individual’s lifespan. Exposure to pollution can alter methyl tags on DNA and make an individual even more susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases [3]. The foods we consume can have an impact on our epigenome; one study has shown that a high-fat, low-carb diet could open up chromatin and thus improve mental ability [1]. </span>

&nbsp;

<strong>A closer look into our epigenome</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Common and widely studied epigenetic alterations include histone modifications and DNA methylation. These mechanisms regulate the expression of genes as well as “cellular and biological functions related to homeostasis, allostasis and disease” [4]. DNA methylation adds a methyl group (-CH</span><span style="font-weight: 400">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400">) to cytosine at a promoter region containing repetitive sequences of CpG (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">cytosine–phosphate–guanine) </span><span style="font-weight: 400">dinucleotides. Proteins then bind to the methylated CpG islands, which correlates with transcriptional repression and affects gene expression [4]. This form of methylation has been previously linked to cancer [5]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As for the modification of histones, ubiquitin</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">a molecule which is attached to a protein destined for degradation</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">has been linked to neurological disorders including Parkinson’s disease and Angelman syndrome [5]. Likewise, histone methylation has been linked to several biological processes: DNA repair, stress responses, development, differentiation and aging [4]. If any one of these processes is altered, whereby histone methylation is either activated or inhibited, this can result in the development and progression of disease. For example, H3K4me2, a post-translational dimethylation at the lysine 4 residue of the histone H3 protein, located at the promoter of active genes, is downregulated in cases of lung, kidney, prostate and pancreatic cancers [6]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Histone modification contributes to the cell cycle, growth, DNA replication and other processes. Therefore, abnormal histone modifications can lead to the development and progression of tumors [6]. </span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Personalized medicine and targeted care</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Inevitably, individuals are prone to changes in their epigenome, which makes providing targeted care an even more challenging task. These changes occur not only between individuals but also within a single individual over time. Therefore, genomic approaches that include identifying specific variations in DNA and RNA sequences can help to bridge the gap between epigenetics and personalized care. Health care professionals have shifted their attention towards diagnostic tests that use genomic data to more accurately assess the extent of a patient’s risk for disease or illness, to determine appropriate dosage amounts and to make conclusions about the benefits of a specific drug or treatment. According to a study by Mahmood Rasool that highlights epigenetics as a contributing factor to personalized and individualized care, “various factors such as nutrition, age, body weight, sex, genetic behavior, infections, co-medications and organ function are important considerations that are unavoidable during the course of treatment for a disease” [4]. </span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Combatting epigenetic changes. What’s next?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Changes due to our environment are unpredictable; therefore, we must take precautions as early as possible. Being wary of how our lifestyle can impact the activation of our genes is crucial to our health and development. We must take preventative measures early in our life and determine which lifestyle changes will benefit us in the long term. Exposure to hazards in our environment is not fully noticeable until years and sometimes decades later. If we place emphasis on the prevention of disease early on, we are much less likely to encounter abrupt and irreversible effects to our well-being. While epigenetic biomarkers are being evaluated for use in environmental risk assessment, more immediate lifestyle changes include reducing exposure to harmful air pollutants, implementing specific dietary changes and altering medication use that will provide long-term benefits, as opposed to only short-term relief [4]. Our diet can result in profound changes in our epigenome, leading to human disease. For instance, lacking essential amino acids in your diet can result in colon cancer, which “impairs biosynthesis of the active precursor for DNA methylation.” Similarly, exposure to nicotine and other toxins can cause epigenetic changes in smokers, “affecting the genes involved in normal pulmonary function.” Exercise can also have important effects on the skeletal-muscle epigenome [7].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">With this being said, we must recognize the importance of integrative medicine in primary care. Physicians, and even specialists, consider the patient as a whole person and are cognizant of their lifestyle, diet, genetic background and even mental health. This holistic approach to medical care provides patients with a greater sense of what they need to accomplish to keep their body and mind healthy. This not only strengthens the connection between practitioner and patient, but it demonstrates the importance of taking preventative measures prior to development of the illness. Understanding epigenetics can increase our awareness of how physical space alters our well-being and reinforce that providing holistic and preventative care reduces the negative impacts of epigenetic changes. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>By Grace Wensley, Biological Sciences ‘21</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Author’s Note: As I saw how the COVID-19 pandemic has so greatly affected the elderly population and immunocompromised adults, I wondered why there wasn’t as much as a conversation about immunocompromised children. I interviewed a pediatric oncology nurse working at Children’s Hospital in Oakland, California, and discovered how difficult the pandemic has been on pediatric oncology patients and the healthcare culture shift that has emerged from it. </span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">This pandemic has taken quite a toll on the healthcare system, and this interview displayed the hardships faced among the pediatric oncology sector. Nurse Kelli Hemmingsen-Smith  discusses how various COVID-related protocols can disrupt pediatric oncology patients’ treatments. Additionally, she describes the emotional impact of the pandemic from limited visitors allowed, a scary environment due to all doctors and nurses wearing masks, and extended inpatient stays for some patients.</span></i>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.</span></i>

&nbsp;

<b>Health Care Practices Pre-COVID-19</b>

<b>Grace Wensley: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">When would your oncology patients wear masks prior to COVID?</span>

<b>Kelli Hemmingsen-Smith, RN</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: I’m trying to remember what life was like before we wore masks. Normally we would ask them to wear a mask any time they were neutropenic—so any time their absolute neutrophil count (ANC), the amount of white blood cells that are actually neutrophils, was under 500. Part of wearing a mask is for [going] outside because of the spores found in the dirt, on top of sick contacts. We try to be a bit more lenient so that kids can have somewhat of a normal life. But, 99 percent of kids have a central line (a catheter placed in a large vein for fast blood draws and drug administering) so what happens at our hospital is if you have a fever and you have a central line, you have to come to the hospital, get a dose of antibiotics that last for 24 hours and then wait. If you get another fever you do the same thing again. If you get to the hospital and you have a fever, and you’re neutropenic, you have to be admitted and stay until your fever resolves and your counts recover which could take weeks. So while we aren’t requiring kids to wear masks in certain situations [prior to COVID] a lot of family members will enforce mask-wearing because if your kid gets a fever, we know it’s probably a virus, but we can’t risk it so this is how we treat it. If it’s not a virus though, kids go septic really fast so they’ve kind of taken it into their own for mask-wearing.</span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">When these patients are neutropenic is that usually due to their chemotherapy? </span>

<b>KH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yes, pretty much all the time. Kids get their chemo. About 7-10 days later, they reach the nadir, which is where your white blood cell counts are at the lowest that they should be, and then they slowly start to recover after that. Also, if they’re sick, that can also cause them to be neutropenic because their immune systems are non-functioning, especially in the beginning days of leukemia, a cancer of your immune system. We can have kids who are waiting for their counts to recover before they start certain chemo, and they can be delayed because their counts aren’t recovering. Sometimes, it can just be because they have a cold. </span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Do patients’ counts have to recover between each dose of chemo? </span>

<b>KH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Depends on the chemo. Not always. Depending on where they are in their cycles. </span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">If their counts aren’t recovering, and they keep getting sick and can’t recover, does their treatment get delayed? </span>

<b>KH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> So mask-wearing is a big deal. Like I said, although we required [mask wearing] only for certain instances, kids getting sick that are in treatment is a huge deal and parents are very aware of that.</span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">In these situations of patients being required to wear masks pre-COVID, would their doctors and nurses also be wearing masks? </span>

<b>KH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Pre-COVID, never.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> I would actually be very surprised if our culture didn’t change in the fact that we always wear a mask to be perfectly honest, because when you really think about it, it does make sense. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">When they are neutropenic in the hospital, they get a private room. Our unit has an entire HEPA-filtered unit, so instead of them having to stay in their rooms they can come out, and there is a playroom. Prior to COVID, the only thing that changed from a nursing standpoint if the kid was neutropenic was what room they were put in and that was it. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Healthcare Practices During COVID-19</b>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Has there been a big delay in cancer treatment schedules due to how the hospital has had to adjust infrastructure with COVID? </span>

<b>KH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">We never limited anything. But the only way that it has really impacted our kid’s treatment is when they are getting procedures. They have to have been tested for COVID within four days of their procedure, and for a lot of our patients, it is hard to get to us twice—it is hard enough to get to us once. We do have a lot more people missing procedures, or we don’t get the results of the COVID tests back fast enough. Now, it’s a little different, because we have a rapid in-house test that takes 2-3 hours. Now, if you missed [the test] and didn’t come, we can usually make it work, but in the beginning, that wasn’t always the case. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">I think where we see the delay the most is if a kid’s family gets COVID. In that case, we hold [off on] chemo because the patient could then test positive for COVID. We automatically hold chemo, get a COVID test, and while they are doing the quarantine we are still holding chemo because we just don’t know. That is 14 days. Then if they get it, that’s another 14 days that we are on hold. These are kids that are usually at the end of their treatments [in clinic] which is what we call the maintenance phase which is where you take oral chemo every day. So a month of not taking it is a lot. How does that affect survival, relapse? We don’t know.</span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Have there been instances where you admit a patient from the clinic to inpatient out of fear that by going home, they could potentially get COVID?</span>

<b>KH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. We had a kid whose housing situation doesn’t allow them to fully quarantine so he just stayed inpatient until we could find a safe place for him to go. We had another patient who was going for a bone marrow transplant, and her family got COVID. We had to hold her marrow transplant until we knew that she had been away from them long enough. She stayed inpatient, and no one could come to visit. But what was really interesting, was once they did the transplant, she got COVID. So we don’t know if it was just “chilling” and when we blasted her immune system it came on. So there is a lot that we don’t know. Would it be fine for the kids to take oral chemo the whole time until their ANC dropped? Maybe. But nobody knows.</span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Have any of your patients had COVID?</span>

<b>KH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yes, and what is very interesting about the kids who have gotten it is that the younger kids have had pretty much zero symptoms, and the only reason we know that they have it is because they have to be tested prior to anesthesia. They get anesthesia a lot because they get chemo through lumbar punctures [spinal tap] which we administer anesthesia for. We automatically hold chemo when they test positive. When their symptoms resolve we restart chemo. A lot of time during that time, their ANC will drop due to the virus, and then we wait longer if their ANC did drop to restart the chemo until it was at the right numbers. They haven’t really been super symptomatic.  I’ve noticed that a couple of the kids that have been getting it have elevated liver enzymes, but that can be caused by chemo too, so it’s kind of one of those where there isn’t really a correlation. I’ve noticed it with two kids. </span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">What is the visitor policy currently? </span>

<b>KH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Inpatient is one person per patient, and that person can alternate and stay overnight with them. In the clinic, we only allow one parent at a time. Before COVID, anyone could come—we couldn’t care less. Now in the clinic, it’s no siblings and only one parent, unless it’s a consent conference or a diagnosis, then we make allowances. </span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you think the strict visitor policy will remain post-COVID?</span>

<b>KH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I would hope that would change because that’s a big hardship. If you have a kid that’s young, and can’t really be left alone, then the parents don’t ever get an overlap period to communicate things like, “Hey this cup is what he’s been taking his medicine in.” I would hope that would change. They can’t see their siblings and that’s a big deal for kids.</span>

<b>GW: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">How have wearing masks affected patient and provider care? </span>

<b>KH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Even now, anytime an employee is in their room, they all have to put masks on.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Us being in masks and gaining rapport with children who are really scared of us is really hard. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s such a simple thing, but we give a lot of toys now. They can’t go in the playroom. There are no volunteers. When kids are awaiting COVID results prior to surgery, it sometimes takes hours to get them back and that whole time they are fasting. Kids get grumpy. While waiting for surgeries, a lot of the time one parent is outside sitting in the car all day on speaker. It’s hard. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion:</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling I observed from the entire interview was that many of these hardships related to COVID-19 will in time go away, but mask-wearing is here to stay. It took a global pandemic to make light of it, but any type of illness can significantly affect the trajectory of a patients’ treatment and masks can help prevent this, so as Hemmingsen-Smith said, “It just makes sense.” </span></i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">By Jessica Lee, Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology ‘21</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Inspired by the success of the asymptomatic testing at UC Davis, I wrote this article exploring the different types of diagnostic and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2, focusing on mechanisms and relative sensitivities and specificities. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of widespread and accurate diagnostic testing in controlling community spread. Together with mask mandates, social distancing, and quarantining, COVID-19 testing can slow the spread of a disease that has killed over 2.5 million people [1]. Approximately 80 million COVID-19 tests have been reported at this time, and yet, many people are confused as to how COVID-19 tests work and how each type of test differs in mechanism, sensitivity, and specificity [2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Depending on the type of COVID-19 diagnostic test, they will either detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, protein, or antibodies generated as a consequence of infection [3]. Samples can be collected from patients via nasal swab, saliva collection, or blood collection [3]. This article will review current COVID-19 tests as well as address potential confusion arising from false negative and false positive results. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Diagnostic Tests</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Diagnostic tests are administered to patients to determine if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 at time of sampling. Such tests may be administered to either symptomatic or asymptomatic patients as a diagnostic tool or preventative public health measure. Various types of diagnostic tests have been developed since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as an infectious agent; however, all tests rely on one of two underlying technologies [4]. Molecular tests detect segments of the viral genome while antigen tests detect the presence of viral proteins [4]. However, both molecular tests and antigen tests differ from antibody tests which detect previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Molecular Tests</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Molecular tests primarily rely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to detect relatively low quantities of SARS-CoV-2 genome [4]. A PCR has four primary components: DNA template, DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, primers, and nucleotides [5]. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single stranded RNA genome meaning the genome can directly be translated into protein by host translation machinery [6]. However, since PCRs require a DNA template, the genome must be converted from RNA to DNA via the enzyme reverse transcriptase [5]. Due to this reverse transcription step, this specific type PCR is called reverse transcription, or RT-qPCR. The resulting DNA product then serves as the template for PCR during which a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase recognizes the template and synthesizes the complementary strand via incorporation of nucleotides. The primers, short DNA fragments about 20 nucleotides in length, are the component of PCR that confers specificity to the assay through their complementarity to a specific region in the DNA template [5]. When all reaction components are combined and cycled through specific temperatures, the result is the exponential increase in the number of copies of the target DNA [5]. Thus, the assay can produce a positive result with very small quantities of original template. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has established two sets of oligonucleotide primers for the detection of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of SARS-CoV-2 [7]. Thus, if SARS-CoV-2 genome is present in a sample, the primers will hybridize to the N gene, resulting in the amplification of the region and yielding a positive result. Other primers for the detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope genes have also been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [7]. Since the primers are essential to establishing high specificity, it is important that the primers only bind to the intended target. If the primer is too promiscuous, the assay might produce a false positive. Alternatively, if the primer is too stringent, the assay might produce a false negative. There is also concern that if the region in which the primers bind mutates, the assay may no longer consistently detect such mutants [7].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Samples for molecular tests may be collected via nasal swab or saliva and may be pooled for more efficient testing [8]. If a sample pool is positive for SARS-CoV-2, the individual samples are then tested to determine which individuals are positive. Care must be taken, however, with pooled sampling because samples with low viral loads may not be detected due to decreased sensitivity [8]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Molecular tests are generally characterized by high sensitivity, high specificity, and moderate price (~$100/test), earning their status as the “gold standard” of COVID-19 testing [9]. However, depending on the laboratory, results may take up to a week to be returned to the patient [3].</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Antigen Tests</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Antigen tests are immunoassays that detect viral proteins by binding viral protein to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [10]. Generally, antibodies specific to the N protein are produced and purified for use in antigen tests [10]. There is more variation in how antigen tests work as compared to molecular tests; however, generally, the antibodies are conjugated to a tag which can either be read by a machine or is visible to the naked eye. The Abbott BinaxNow COVID-19 Ag Card is even similar to an over-the-counter pregnancy test--a positive result is indicated by a line in a test window [10]. Samples are collected via nasal or nasopharyngeal swab and are flowed over test strips loaded with conjugated antibodies [3,9]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Antigen tests often produce results within 15-30 minutes--much faster than many of the molecular tests [3]. Thus, many health care providers use antigen tests as point-of-care “rapid” tests [9]. Although antigen tests are generally cheaper than molecular tests at about $5-50 per test and are highly specific, they are moderately less sensitive than molecular tests [9]. If the antigen level of a specimen is low due to collection before symptom onset or in late infection, a false negative may be more likely than if a molecular test was administered [9]. However, for both molecular and antigen tests, the probability of a false positive is low due to their high specificity [9]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Antibody Tests</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of diagnosing active SARS-CoV-2 infections, antibody tests indicate if the patient has an adaptive immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection [3]. Samples are collected via fingerstick--a device which pricks the finger to produce a few drops of blood--or blood draw and detect the presence of antibodies generated by SARS-CoV-2 infection [3]. There are many different types of antibody tests, but all can be sorted into two categories: binding antibody detection or neutralizing antibody detection tests [11]. Assays that detect antibodies through binding of an antigen use purified spike or nucleocapsid protein from SARS-CoV-2 to determine if the patient has previously been infected [11]. The mechanism of these tests is very similar to antigen tests which also depend on the selective binding of antibodies to antigens. Neutralizing antibody detection tests determine the ability of antibodies in a sample to prevent infection in cell culture [11]. This category of tests give a more accurate assessment of a patient to resist reinfection.    </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> The CDC’s binding antibody test uses purified spike protein for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies [12, 13]. While both IgG and IgM antibodies are usually generated 1-3 weeks after exposure to an antigen, IgG antibodies persist longer--often months post infection [11]. Due to the lag between peak viral production and peak antibody production, antibody tests cannot be used as diagnostic tools; however, they are useful for identifying recovered individuals for surveillance purposes[13]. Furthermore, widespread serology surveillance allows public health officials to monitor where COVID-19 cases are concentrated and inform public health policy [14].  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Some antibody tests have high specificity and sensitivity; although, this is highly dependent on the type of test and period of time post infection. Tests may result in a false negative if there has not been sufficient antibody production or if antibody levels have decreased below the limit of detection [13,11]. For example, if one compares a test that only detects IgM antibodies to a test that only detects IgG antibodies, one might see differential results if administered months after infection. Some antibody tests have a slight cross-reactivity with SARS1 and MERS-CoV sera which could result in false positives; however, there is minimal cross-reactivity with commonly circulating coronaviruses [15]. While nucleic acid detection tests remain the gold standard for diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibody tests can be valuable tools for clinical and surveillance efforts [12]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Asymptomatic Testing </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Many U.S. colleges have implemented regular, asymptomatic testing of their students and employee populations [16]. Regular testing can allow early cases of COVID-19 to be identified and allow for efficient contact tracing, limiting the spread of COVID-19. At UC Davis, students and employees who go on campus are required to get tested at least every week at the free asymptomatic testing clinic [17]. With the ability to screen thousands of samples each day, UC Davis has expanded its saliva testing program to include the greater Davis community, catching at least 850 asymptomatic cases that otherwise might have spread to other individuals [17]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Clearly, the importance of widespread testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cannot be understated. Testing is one of the most important tools public health officials have to monitor and control the ongoing pandemic.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">By Jesse Kireyev, History ‘21</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> There’s an indescribable type of heartbreak that comes from hearing a close diabetic family member or friend tell you they cannot afford their next dose and won’t be able to for weeks. A day or two of missed insulin shots could easily end in death as it did for at least one individual mentioned in this article. It’s an especially American experience to be gripped in fear for your loved one’s life because the barebones that they need to survive is out of reach, and despite the relatively high prevalence of diabetes in the population, it’s an issue that’s starkly ignored. Mothers, fathers, siblings, and children wilting away in hospital rooms don’t grab headlines as easily as the latest political trauma, and so too often they get entirely ignored. While I chose to conclude the article on a hopeful note, it’s vital to emphasize that while we wait far too patiently for that hope to materialize, more diabetics die. Many of those who outwaited their hope will never have it again. Americans can’t wait much longer.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Oakland, California, has always been a hub of counterculture. Set in the heart of the Bay Area, Oakland has hosted dozens of America’s most famous hip hop musicians, visual artists, social justice advocates, and tech pioneers. This cultural backdrop has facilitated the creation of the Open Insulin Project: a communal space where diabetics and biohackers meet twice a week to try to create an open source guide that would let type 1 diabetics produce insulin at home. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Diagnosis of this condition was once a death sentence. Prior to the discovery of artificially produced insulin, a child diagnosed with type 1 diabetes had only about a year or two to live after diagnosis [1]. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that develops when the immune system starts treating beta cells in the pancreas as a threat and attacks them. The beta cells are responsible for insulin production, so as they are attacked, the pancreas becomes unable to produce insulin. The reasons for why this happens are unknown — current theories suggest environmental and hereditary factors may play a big role, but lifestyle factors do not seem to affect it significantly. This differs from type 2 diabetes, which causes your body to resist the effects of insulin rather than making it unable to produce it [2]. Insulin is a hormone that your body naturally produces to regulate the amount of glucose, or blood sugar, in your system. As type 1 diabetes develops and insulin production stops altogether, the body loses its ability to regulate blood sugar unless insulin is supplemented through injection. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The grim sites of hospital wards full of dying children pushed three scientists at the University of Toronto—Sir Frederick Banting, Charles Best, and JJR Macleod—to discover insulin in 1921. The theory of injecting insulin to regulate blood sugar wasn’t developed until a year later by James Collip, but the first patients treated with insulin injections suffered from severe allergic reactions due to the insulin’s impurity. Collip discovered a way to purify it, putting insulin to use to save children dying from diabetic ketoacidosis—a dangerous diabetic complication that can often end in a coma or death that develops when the body, lacking glucose, begins to produce ketones that acidify the blood. Shortly after discovering and producing insulin, the researchers refused any compensation for their discovery and gave exclusive production rights to a chemical manufacturing firm in Indianapolis, which was to sell insulin at three cents per  unit. As a New York Herald article from 1923 put it, Sir Frederick Banting set out to make insulin “available for even the poorest sufferers from diabetes” [3]. Despite Banting’s intentions, the price of insulin has since soared.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The current cost to produce a single vial of human insulin is somewhere in the range of two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half dollars, and a year’s supply of the medicine could be sold to type 1 diabetes patients for as little as seventy-two dollars, a cost that is not only affordable to consumers but still produces a large profit margin for the pharmaceutical companies creating it [4]. And yet insulin prices remain far higher than they theoretically should be. A survey of medical prices conducted by the Health Care Cost Institute showed that in 2016 type 1 diabetics paid an average of $5,705 for insulin, over seventy-nine times the cost of what medical researchers believe they should be paying [5]. American diabetes patients paid an average of $300 for a vial of Humalog, a specific type of insulin, in 2019. That same vial costs just thirty-two dollars  in Canada [6]. As a result, more people are trying to fight back against these skyrocketing costs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Drug development can drain millions of dollars from a pharmaceutical company’s budget, meaning companies have to sell their drugs at high prices to recoup the costs of development. New developments to certain medications can temporarily raise their prices, which is a reason often used by pharmaceutical companies to defend their price increases, but that’s not the case with insulin. Dr. Nicholas Argento said in an interview with Business Insider, “The products that are out are not really new. They may have tweaked the manufacturing process and[...]they have better delivery pens and the like, but the increase in price has been astronomical” [7].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While the base drug itself hasn’t seen significant development in decades, the patent on it still remains, and keeps getting extended. “Drugs are kept on patent by making somewhat fairly small fluctuations or modifications to the particular thing, like insulin,” said Dr. Huising. This effectively prevents the production of a cheaper, generic version of the drug, leaving diabetics to rely on insulin produced by only three suppliers in the United States. Canadian patients are able to buy insulin at lower costs due to increased market price regulation, as well as the fact that Canada allows generic insulin into the market, side-stepping the patent issues that generic insulin would face in the United States. And the patents still have a while to go before expiring: just last year, French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, one of the three insulin suppliers in the United States, got its patent extended to 2031. The medical advocacy non-profit, Initiative for Medicine, Access, and Knowledge, points to this as one of the main culprits behind the price increases, stating in its 2018 report, “The U.S. cannot fix the drug pricing crisis until it solves the drug patent problem” [8]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When comparing the price of insulin produced by each of these three companies, it is clear that each company sells its product at almost the exact same price, and price increases between the three companies have remained almost identical over the past few decades. While the companies deny any collusion or price fixing, by law, pharmaceutical corporations are not required to provide the reasons behind price increases, and they can raise them without limit [9]. The issue has become so dire that in 2018, the Congressional Diabetes Caucus released a report stating that the current system is “unfairly putting insulin out of reach, placing millions of lives at risk” [10].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Placing millions of lives at risk is not an over exaggeration: without enough insulin, blood sugar rapidly increases. A diabetic with high blood sugar runs the immediate risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis, alongside long-term cardiovascular and nervous system problems, which can significantly shorten lifespans. According to Dr. Kasia Lipska, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Medicine, “About 1 in 5 people with type 2 need insulin to prevent short-term and long-term complications like blindness, kidney failure, and dialysis and heart disease” [11]. For other types of non-gestational diabetes, the risk is more immediate: “Insulin is a life-saving drug, people need it,” says Dr. Huising. “If you have type 1 diabetes and no insulin, you die.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">These problems can emerge from missing just a few doses of insulin, something that many diabetics increasingly have to resort to due to its cost. Lipska et al. published a study in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that found that over a fourth of diabetes patients have had to cut back on insulin dosage due to the high price of the medicine. The human costs of insulin prices are very real. In a CBS interview, the mother of a man who died because he couldn’t afford his medicine spoke out against the costs. Alec, a young man with diabetes, began to ration his insulin when faced with a $1,300 price tag. Unfortunately, after struggling under a diabetic coma, the lack of insulin cost him his life. “I wanted to be there with him, to hold his hand, or to call for help. And then I think about if he had never moved out, if he had lived at home, somebody would have seen the signs,” she said. “I’ll probably feel guilty every day for the rest of my life” [12].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It is within this context that a number of rogue diabetics in Oakland have begun to try to synthesize their own insulin supply. The Open Insulin Project was started in 2015 by Anthony Di Franco, a type 1 diabetic who struggled for years with being able to buy his insulin. The project utilizes biohacking—a movement that applies do-it-yourself, rule-averse hacker practices to the exploitation of genetic material—to create a homebrew form of insulin for type 1 diabetics. The project’s motives are exceptionally ambitious, given that almost none of the people involved are trained biochemists. Di Franco and other project leaders such as David Anderson lack experience in biological or chemical sciences, and neither work in relevant fields—Di Franco is a computer scientist, and David Anderson is pursuing a degree in business economics [13]. The Project aims to one day create a fully safe and functional form of insulin, and recent developments in the chemical process have shown some promise. Currently, the Project is hoping to convert proinsulin—insulins’ chemical precursor—to full insulin, after which they will attempt to scale their process up [14]. But some have their doubts. Hank Greely, a professor at the Center for Law and Biosciences at Stanford University, warns that “manufacturing pharmaceuticals is difficult, painstaking, and dangerous. If you get the dosing or the strength on the insulin wrong, it’s death. If you let contaminants into the insulin, it’s possible death. If your insulin breaks down too quickly in storage, it’s death” [13].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Dosing is a difficult challenge in a homebrew environment, where biohackers might not be able to access the proper equipment to create safe and stable insulin with consistent doses and without contaminants. Immunogenic reactions—wherein a foreign molecule entering the body provokes an immune system response—predominates the list of concerns over impurities. “You’re injecting something. If there is an impurity there that is a foreign molecule, then your immune system might start to respond,” Dr. Huising said. “Doing it at scale with a quality that is consistent is extremely challenging to do. It’s not that hard to make it if you’re a trained biochemist, but making it with a quality and consistency that is compatible with injecting it as a drug over multiple batches is hard to achieve.”  Nor does the Project have access to most of the biochemistry equipment Dr. Huising insists is necessary to create insulin safe for injection. “The motivation behind wanting to make insulin is clear,” he said. “But doing it homebrew style is just dangerous and irresponsible.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Due to this, the Open Insulin Project may face legal challenges from the FDA and other regulatory agencies, challenges that the Project may not have the money or resources to address.  This is not a problem that has escaped the minds of those running the Project, as they currently are trying to figure out the legal issues surrounding human testing and safety of human consumption. That is why the project has been focusing on creating a do-it-yourself guide to synthesizing insulin at home—while the FDA can regulate distribution of medicine; the first amendment stops them from regulating the distribution of a guide on how to make the medicine. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">But the situation may soon change enough that the need for the Open Insulin Project will fade away entirely. Over the past few years, the FDA has been pursuing paths to change insulin regulatory procedures, introduce generic insulin to the market, and lower the costs of the drug—policies that the last three presidential administrations have publicly advocated for. Dr. Huising has hope that this public pressure might help insulin prices fall within the next few years—“Even in the past couple of years, there has been talk in Washington about how big pharma does overcharge. I don’t think that’s necessarily a left or a right talking point,” he said. “There is a recipe there for improvement, where we demand that insulin is made available at prices that don't force people to self censor or self limit how much insulin they dose themselves with.” </span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> A recent switch into the Microbiology major prompted me to explore recent developments in the field. I came across this study that examined the role of gut microbiota in brain function and mood regulation. With the globally rising prevalence of depression, this study provides some potential insight into the development of the disorder on a physiological level and provides a novel approach to anti-depression therapeutics. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Afflicting nearly 350 million individuals annually, depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite the widespread effort to uncover the environmental and genetic basis of the disorder, the pathophysiology of depression remains elusive. This is attributed to the fact that, similar to other mental disorders, depression is the result of a complex interplay between several biological and societal factors [1]. Several studies have found that the pathology of depression is influenced by dysfunction in neuromodulatory systems, such as the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is composed of endocannabinoids (eCB), lipid-based neurotransmitters that regulate mood, emotions, and stress responses [2,3]. Another physiological factor that contributes to depression is the impairment of the hippocampal region of the brain, specifically hippocampal impaired neurogenesis, which contributes to depressive-like behaviors in rodents [4]. This is due to the fact that adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been shown to help mediate stress responses and depressive behavior. The dysfunction of these critical processes has recently been investigated in relation to symbiotic microbiota. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">It has been well established that the diversity of intestinal microbiota contributes to enhanced host function (particularly in immunity, metabolism, and the central nervous system) allowing an individual to better combat disease and regulate metabolic function [5,6,7]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Previous studies have demonstrated that dysbiosis, or altered intestinal microbial composition, has been found in depressed patients when compared to healthy controls</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [8].  It has also been observed that microbiota modulate anxiety symptoms in mice via the release of bacterial metabolites that may affect critical pathways in the brain [9]. Finally, colitis, a digestive disease characterized by inflammation in the colon, is influenced by gut microbiota and is commonly observed in depression patients [10]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, these studies imply a potential association between intestinal microbial composition and depressive-like behaviors</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The following study aims to examine the direct effect of gut microbiota on depressive behaviors in mice, allowing for a broader understanding of the physiological basis of depression and provide new avenues for therapeutics and potential treatment [11].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Researchers used unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), a mouse model of stress-induced depression. To simulate stress, mice in the UCMS group were exposed to various stressors including cage tilting, altered cage bedding, foreign odor, and altered light/dark cycle. The mice in the UCMS group were exposed to two stressors a day for eight weeks. As expected, UCMS mice exhibited depressive-like behaviors such as decreased feeding and self-grooming behavior, consistent with apathetic behavior in those diagnosed with depression. UCMS mice also exhibited reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, confirming a previous study by Snyder et al. that noted this observation in rodents with depression [3].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Once depressive-like behaviors were established in UCMS mice, researchers conducted a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from mice exposed to stressors to mice that have not been exposed to any stressors. FMT’s are an innovative form of treatment in which a stool sample is collected from one individual and transplanted in the colon of another individual. This can be administered in various ways, such as a colonoscopy, oral capsules, or via a tube that stretches from the nose into the stomach or bowel [12]. In this study, mice received transplants via an oral gavage which involves the passage of a feeding needle down the esophagus. The purpose of an FMT is to populate the recipient intestine with diverse microorganisms that preferentially provide some benefit to the host. When the microbiota from the UCMS mice was transplanted into the healthy mice, the healthy mice exhibited decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and mimicked the depressive-like behaviors exhibited in the UCMS mice, although the healthy mice had not been exposed to any stressors. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The effect of the FMT on recipient mice illustrated the influence of intestinal microbial composition on the host. Researchers in this study hypothesized that this was due to alterations in the host’s metabolism. To investigate this further, the concentration of multiple small molecule metabolites in bodily fluids was measured. This revealed a significant decrease in levels of several short-chain fatty acids which may have resulted from dysbiosis-induced changes. As fat is primarily broken down in the small intestine via chemical and mechanical processes, an altered microbial composition in the intestinal tract would unsurprisingly influence fat breakdown. More specifically, there was a decrease in the concentration of an eCB precursor, fatty acids containing </span><span style="font-weight: 400">arachidonic acid (AA), in recipient mice. As dysregulation of the ECS has been studied in association with depression, this finding in recipient mice aligns with the typical model of depression. To further understand the role of impaired eCB signaling in the recipient mice, researchers observed whether enhancing eCB signaling via dietary supplementation could alleviate the depressive-like behaviors observed in the recipient mice. It was found that recipient mice that were orally administered AA had reversed the depressive-like behaviors indeed by UCMS microbiota. Additionally, AA supplementation aided hippocampal neurogenesis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To determine how UCMS microbiota affected the microbial composition of recipient mice, fecal microbiota from UCMS mice was sequenced using 16s rRNA. As 16s rRNA is present in all bacteria, the 16s rRNA gene is highly conserved and therefore, a useful tool to identify microbes within complex biological mixtures. The analysis revealed increased levels of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ruminoccacaae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Porphyromonodaceae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and a decrease in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lactobacillacae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. This finding supports previous studies that report an association between decreased </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lactobacillacae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and stress in mice. The differences in the microbial composition of recipient mice and donor UCMS mice were maintained eight weeks after transplantation. To test the influence of decreased </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lactobacillacae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">in recipient mice, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lactobacillacae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">was orally administered similarly to AA supplantation. Dietary complementation of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lactobacillacae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> had a similar effect as AA supplantation, where depressive-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis were reversed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Using mice, researchers discovered that the onset of depressive-like behaviors is triggered by a reduction in lipid metabolites. These lipid metabolites, more specifically endocannabinoids, bind to receptors in regions of the brain that control emotion and memory. Surprisingly, the concentrations of endocannabinoids are biochemically influenced by the gut microbiota. Although the mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be understood, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">these studies have elucidated the impact of gut microbiota beyond digestive function, revealing the extensive scope of microbial composition on healthy host function</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. This study specifically illustrates the importance of balanced gut microbiota for healthy neural and metabolic function and supports the potential use of dietary or probiotic supplementation as a treatment option for those diagnosed with depression. However, it is important to note that this area of research is relatively new and further studies are required to determine the translational capacity of studies related to the gut-brain axis from mice to humans. With consideration of the limitations of this study, this finding does still provide an intriguing avenue of treatment for mood disorders by introducing a novel physiological approach to mediate depressive-like symptoms. </span>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrote this literature review for my UWP104F class to assess new opioid-based medications for pain-relief. While opioids are the best known pain relievers we currently have, they have the severe risks of addiction and overdose. This paper analyzes literature that attempts to amplify the analgesic (pain-relief) properties of opioids, while minimizing their addictive potential. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As the opioid epidemic grows, opioids are becoming increasingly synonymous with addiction and overdose. While opioids have immense pain-relief properties, their use has been limited due to their major risks. The potential for addiction lies in the interaction between opioids and the mu-opioid receptor. Scientists are working to create a modified receptor that can have these analgesic effects but have limited risk. These findings could aid in the development of safer but effective pain-relief medications. </span>

<b>Background</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder that occurs through repeated exposure to the drug, leading to physiological changes in brain chemistry [6]. While initial use is associated with improved well-being and feelings of euphoria, this repeated use in addition to environmental factors and genetics can lead to modifications in the endogenous opioid system, or the body’s natural pain killers, and alterations of stress physiology through hormonal imbalance [6, 7]. These homeostatic changes deregulate brain reward pathways, resulting in tolerance and dependence [7]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Opioids have a significantly higher rate of relapse compared to other addictive drugs since they induce strong physical dependence [7] and craving [7]. As a result, scientists have extensively studied the mu-opioid receptor (MOPr), which directly binds to opioids and indirectly binds to other addictive drugs, such as alcohol, cannabinoids, and nicotine [6]. Current research is focused on understanding the mechanism of the MOPr. While scientists agree that this mechanism plays a role in physical dependence, it is unclear what part of this pathway is responsible for these observed effects. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Opioids act as agonists at the MOPr. Agonists modify a receptor through intrinsic efficacy and affinity. Affinity determines how well a ligand is able to bind to the active site of a receptor and intrinsic efficacy is a measure of how well a ligand is able to stabilize the receptor in its active conformation [1]. Intrinsic efficacy is particularly important for the MOPr because the MOPr is strongly agonist-dependent [6]. For instance, morphine acts as a full agonist at the MOPr, inducing the maximal effect. As a result, morphine is commonly used to study the function of this receptor and its role in addiction. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">At the MOPr, opioids bind to the active site inducing a conformational change and activating the receptor. The MOPr is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which is a type of receptor where activation leads to secondary pathway signaling. As a result, binding of a ligand to the MOPr causes secondary pathways to be activated, resulting in downstream signaling effects. Specifically, the MOPr is a G</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-coupled GPCR, so it inhibits the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which converts ATP to cAMP. As a result, opioid binding inhibits the production of cAMP. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This effect is brief. MOPr activation promotes translocation of β-arrestin from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. MOPr is rapidly phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs). This phosphorylation increases the affinity of β-arrestin to the MOPr [6]. β-arrestin binds to the MOPr. This binding uncouples the MOPr from the G</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-coupled GPCR, which halts the inhibition of cAMP production. This uncoupling further halts the signaling pathways and results in desensitization of the MOPr, since the opioid can no longer induce downstream effects.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">β-arrestin also recruits components of the endocytic machinery [2] to engulf the MOPr into the cell. The desensitized receptor is internalized within the cell via endocytosis [2]. Endocytosis plays an important role in engulfing the desensitized receptor, which is no longer functional, and placing it back into the plasma membrane resensitized, or functional. This rapid resensitization process is important for having a consistent supply of available receptors for ligand binding. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Naloxone acts to block agonists of the MOPr and is used as a treatment for drug overdose, and to induce withdrawal in experimental models. As an antagonist, naloxone has zero intrinsic efficacy, so it does not modify the constitutive activity of the receptor.  Essentially antagonists do not activate any additional pathways but have an affinity for the active site of the respective receptor [1]. As a result, naloxone competes with agonists for the binding site and prevents agonists from inducing an effect on the MOPr. Their ability to compete is dependent on their level of affinity. Opioid antagonists are used in drug experiments to quickly stop drug administration in the brain to assess signs of physical dependence. This method is efficient because it can prevent agonists from working, even when the agonist is present in the bloodstream. For this reason, antagonists are also administered following overdose to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression, where the brain stops sending signals to the body to breathe [4]. </span>

<b>β-arrestin and Physical Dependence</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Enkephalins, an endogenous opioid, at the MOPr activate the G</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-coupled GPCR and β-arrestin in equal amounts. As a result, enkephalins are “unbiased.” However, many addictive opioids, such as morphine, act as biased agonists signaling the G</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-coupled GPCR and β-arrestin asymmetrically [1]. At the MOPr, scientists hypothesize that “G-protein signaling [is] responsible for opioid-induced analgesia, while [β-arrestin is] responsible for the adverse effects of mu-receptor activation” [9]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In a study in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nature Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> of β-arrestin-2 knockout mice by Bohn et al., they studied the development of antinociception tolerance following daily administration of a moderate dose of morphine (10 mg/kg) for nine days [3]. They conducted this experiment to determine whether chronic morphine use can diminish antinociception over time, a sign of addiction. They used wild-type mice as controls. To control for genetic variation, they crossed over eight generations of mice that were heterozygous for β-arrestin-2. This allowed them to develop wild-type and knockout mice (through the homozygous progeny) that were “age-matched, 3—5-month-old male siblings weighing between 20 and 30 g [3]. The wild-type mice had a significantly diminished response to morphine administration by day five. In contrast, the knockout mice had comparable antinociception throughout the entire experimental period [3]. These findings suggest that β-arrestin presence has a significant role in the development of antinociceptive tolerance. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, β-arrestin plays multiple roles in the MOPr trafficking process. To further assess these results, researchers studied one aspect of β-arrestin, promoting endocytosis. Kim et al. hypothesized that over time morphine binding to the MOPr led to diminished antinociception, tolerance, and dependence due to morphine’s inability “to promote substantial receptor endocytosis” [10]. They generated knockout mice by genetically modifying the MOPr at exon 3 to create an experimental receptor (rMOP-R) that would be more effective at resensitizing the receptor through endocytosis [10]. They used wild-type mice as a control. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The mice with the rMOP-R had enhanced and prolonged analgesic effects compared to the wild-type mice with the MOP-R. They suggested that these results were due to the rMOP-R being active for longer due to quicker resensitization [10]. Furthermore, they assessed tolerance and dependence over both a short-term experiment (one day) and a long-term experiment (five days). The wild-type mice displayed both acute and chronic antinociceptive tolerance to morphine, as well as withdrawal responses to any administration of naloxone following morphine administration. The knockout mice did not develop acute or chronic antinociceptive tolerance to morphine and showed much fewer withdrawal responses to administration of naloxone following morphine administration [10]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Kim et al. did these experiments with endogenous opioids (DAMGO), morphine, and methadone with acts similarly to endogenous opioids. They found a significant difference between the wild-type and knockout mice for morphine administration only [10]. This supports their hypothesis since DAMGO and methadone already have enhanced endocytosis. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">These results suggest that enhanced endocytosis of the MOPr can help alleviate tolerance and signs of physical dependence while maintaining the antinociceptive effects.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> While β-arrestin functions to recruit the endocytic machinery, it also turns </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">off</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> the MOPr by desensitizing the receptor. Since the MOPr is strongly agonist-dependent, morphine acting at this receptor results in an increased period of desensitization. By diminishing this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">off</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> period through enhanced endocytosis, the rMOP-R receptor leads to quicker resensitization, alleviating signs of physical dependence [10]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To further explore this hypothesis, Berger and Whistler conducted a similar study to Kim et al. by comparing the knockout mice with rMOP-R to wild-type mice with the MOPr in a conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm and self-administration study. A CPP paradigm is when the mice are placed in a room with two sides that are decorated in distinct manners. On one side they are administered morphine, while they are not on the other side. Preference for morphine is determined by which room they spend more time in. For the CPP paradigm, the rMOP-R mice displayed greater CPP at lower doses and the wild-type mice displayed greater CPP at higher doses [2]. This indicates that the knockout mice had a large rewarding effect at low doses, suggesting that smaller doses of morphine elicited a larger effect in the knockout mice compared to the wild-type mice. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, they assessed how these mice lines differed for additional determinants of addiction in a self-administration study. For each operant session, the mice were allowed to administer morphine on the first day, morphine and water for the next four days, and were given only water on the last two days of the experiment [2]. They assessed four factors: “high motivation to obtain drug,” “futile drug-seeking,” “persistent drug-seeking in the face of adverse consequences,” and “reduced preference for alternative rewards” [2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Berger and Whistler found that when morphine was administered into the lever at regular intervals, the knockout mice learned these intervals while the wild-type mice attempted to administer the drug more often by pressing the lever, even though it was in between the intervals [2]. They further assessed lever presses when accompanied by an electric shock or in the presence of an alternate reward, saccharin. The wild-type mice administered the drug more often and showed a greater preference for morphine respectively for these experiments compared to the knockout mice [2]. These results indicate that the enhanced endocytosis and quicker resensitization of the MOPr helps alleviate the adverse effects of addiction beyond physical dependence. </span>

<b>G-Protein Biased Agonists </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Based on these findings, researchers hypothesize that creating drugs that are G-protein biased agonists could help improve the antinociceptive effects of opioids while diminishing the adverse effects of delayed desensitization due to β-arrestin [9]. There is ongoing research to develop G-protein-biased agonists of the MOPr. For instance, oliceridine, a G-protein-biased agonist, is currently in Phase 3 of clinical trials [8]. However, current research is bringing into question whether only β-arrestin is responsible for the adverse effects of addiction [8]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There is now evidence suggesting that “MOPr activation in [the preBotzinger (preBotC) and Kolliker-Fuse (KF) neurons] … inhibits neuronal activity via G protein signaling” [8]. The preBotC and KF neurons are located in regions of the brain associated with respiratory control [8]. They also found that the activation of GRKs, which promotes arrestin binding to G</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-coupled GPCRs, is mediated by G protein signaling [8].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In a study in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">British Journal of Pharmacology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> of morphine-induced respiratory depression independent of β-arrestin-2 by Kliewer et al., they used β-arrestin knockout mice to assess respiratory depression when administered an opioid. This experiment was conducted in three laboratories, located in Jena, Germany; Sydney, Australia; and Bristol, United Kingdom [11]. Each laboratory used a similar experimental set-up with slight variations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">They all found a “dose-dependent depression of respiratory rate by morphine” [11]. The laboratory in Jena used a nose-out plethysmography system; the laboratories in Sydney and Bristol used whole-body plethysmography [11]. (Plethysmography methods assess the difference in the volume of air present in the lungs prior to and post-exhaling.) </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While biased agonism has been suggested as a possible mechanism to isolate the analgesic properties of opioids from the adverse effects, these studies point out weaknesses in this model.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> First, the initial study assessing β-arrestin-2 knockout mice has not been extensively repeated to verify accuracy and the pathway for respiratory depression cannot be isolated to only β-arrestin [11]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This new evidence indicates that both G-protein signaling and β-arrestin play a role in the physical dependence on opioids.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> However, more research is needed to determine the extent of how much each protein influences these physiological symptoms. </span>

<b>Discussion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While the original findings indicated that only β-arrestin is responsible for the adverse effects of opioid use, new research suggests that these effects cannot be easily isolated to just β-arrestin. The results indicate that β-arrestin plays a role in tolerance and dependence, while G-protein plays a role in respiratory depression during an overdose. More research on G-protein signaling and its connection to the dopamine reward pathway is necessary to understand the extent of its involvement in the MOPr trafficking system. Furthermore, more research is needed to replicate the studies done on β-arrestin-2 knockout mice because these studies have not been extensively replicated, bringing into question the accuracy of these past findings. Also, our understanding of the role of β-arrestin-2 in the desensitization of the MOPr is based on research done in HEK 293 cells, found in the human embryonic kidney; these results have not been replicated in neurons [5], yet the MOPr trafficking system occurs within neurons. Overall, further research is needed to establish the reliability of past findings on β-arrestin and to understand the adverse effects of G-protein signaling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The latter is especially important because current research is focused on developing G-protein-biased agonists to act as analgesics; however, these new analgesics may still pose the risk of respiratory depression.  </span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Current research of the mu-opioid receptor trafficking system indicates that both β-arrestin and G</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-coupled GPCR are responsible for the adverse effects of opioids, including tolerance, dependence, and respiratory depression. More extensive research is required to determine the exact roles of the β-arrestin and G</span><span style="font-weight: 400">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400">-coupled GPCR, while also verifying the results of past studies. These findings can help determine the risk of respiratory depression in the development of new analgesics and extend our understanding of the development of tolerance and withdrawal in addiction. Moreover, these results can help diminish the risk of more potent opioids, while acting as effective pain medications. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">By Vishwanath Prathikanti, Political Science ‘23</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> While doing research for a paper on the mental decline in adults during the pandemic, I discovered something alarming occurring in younger people. While young adults are still the most susceptible to acquire depression in the pandemic, an unprecedented number of K-12 students were as well. Furthermore, K-12 students facing parental abuse were not being recognized as often as before due to the new virtual learning environment they are in. In this paper, I identify what this can lead to, and why we should be doing a better job protecting our younger students.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As college students, we often take for granted the fact that, if we do not have a positive relationship with our parents, many of us can live on campus during the pandemic. Children do not have this luxury, and in fact, the pandemic has made the threat of child abuse arguably even more dangerous.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Part 1: Adverse Childhood Experiences and their effect on the biological development of adolescents.</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">An Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) can be any traumatic experience in a child’s life from the ages of 0-17, ranging from the death of a family member to abuse or neglect [1]. ACE’s are relatively common in the US, with around 61% of adults reporting to have experienced some form of an ACE in their lifetime [1]. Apart from the psychological damage, chronic stress caused by ACE’s has a number of harmful effects on a biological level, including a weakened immune system, which can result in premature death [2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">First and foremost, ACE’s cause a fear response in multiple parts of the brain; the amygdala mediates the response, the prefrontal cortex is involved with the cognitive response, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is critical in the stress response [3]. In a developing brain, extra stressors can cause dysregulation of the HPA system, which inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis, or the growth of new neurons [3]. These stressors have been found to cause cognitive defects in children resulting in lower attention span, lower scores in problem-solving, and lower scores on the California Verbal Learning Test long delay-free recall, which tests learning and memory [4]. Children who suffer from these stressors are often diagnosed with PTSD as a result of the ACE.</span>

<b>Part 2: How COVID-19 makes these situations more difficult to notice and likely more frequent</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">An important fact to note is that child abuse is more likely to occur in households with parentswho are chronically stressed or have mental illnesses such as depression [1]. COVID-19 has seen a general rise in mental illnesses and general stress across the world, with one study reporting a rise in depression from 14.6 percent to 48.3 percent and stress increasing from 8.1 percent to 81.9 percent [5]. Unsurprisingly, experts are concerned that this has resulted in a surge in domestic abuse. It is important to note is that while reports of child abuse have gone down by 20-70 percent (depending on the area), it is very likely that this is because the primary reporters were teachers, doctors, and social workers who had higher access to children before the pandemic [6, 7]. Furthermore, while the visits themselves have decreased, visits that result in hospitalization increased from 2.1 to 3.2 percent, suggesting that injury severity is getting worse [6].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, teachers are one of the most important ways of identifying and reporting child abuse. Rashes and bruises are easily identifiable by teachers when a child is at school for the majority of the day. On the less physical side of things, when a student is distressed or is showing signs of poor mental health, such as inattentiveness or stress, teachers will address it with a personal conversation with the student. However, it is much more difficult to observe these signs of abuse over online platforms, such as Zoom. Rashes and bruises are much harder to detect due to limited to no visibility of a child’s body, and when students mute themselves or turn off their camera, it is extremely difficult to gauge attention and recognize when there is a problem. The zoom format of group meetings is also naturally less conducive to one-on-one meetings with teachers and students that would normally be very flexible and easy to conduct in person. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Kevin Gee from the UC Davis School of Education spoke about K-12 education and dealing with the challenges COVID has posed for this age group during a UC Davis live event. According to Gee, the more support schools can provide to kids the better. “I know of schools that did one-on-one home visits; socially distanced with masks just to check in on how kids are doing,” Gee said [8]. Gee went on to further explain how schools often have many strategies for recovering “academic learning losses, but we still don’t know a lot about how one goes about recovering socio-emotional losses that have been incurred over the past year and a half” [8].</span>

<b>Part 3: Implications for adults</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In abuse-related PTSD specifically, adults have been shown to have smaller hippocampal volumes after experiencing an ACE followed by chronic stressors [3, 9]. This smaller volume results in a myriad of memory-related effects. The most significant were deficits in verbal short-term memory, or the ability to remember words that were just spoken, and a failure to activate the hippocampus during memory tasks, leading to poor memory or the inability to make new memories [3]. This reduction in volume can be seen in the other aspects of the brain that contribute to a fear response, including the prefrontal and frontal cortices, cerebellum, and corpus callosum [3]. Neuronal survival and synaptic connectivity generally decreased, resulting in abnormalities in brain structure, possibly leading to psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [10, 11].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The implications of this data are grim, indicating that COVID-19 may produce a generation suffering from mental illness brought on by ACE’s on a scale never before seen. With no way of knowing exactly how many children are affected, it is crucial to focus on preventing abuse rather than intervening when signs appear. This shift can be seen in the passing of the Family First Prevention Services Act of 2018, which is still being updated and improved today. The act focuses on giving states the option to spend money on “prevention services that would allow ‘candidates for foster care’ to stay with their parents or relatives” given the candidates create a “written, trauma-informed prevention plan” that is evidence-based [12]. So far the process for actually implementing these changes has been slow, and not all states have approved the reimbursement of medical charges for families [13]. It’s a relatively small step, and many more must be made to prevent a rise in ACE’s and the health detriments that accompany them in COVID-19.</span>

<b>Author’s note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I was recently introduced to this topic and the potential for sEH inhibition in the context of Alzheimer’s while at Dr. Lee-Way Jin’s lab in the MIND Institute. Further research into the topic outside the lab led to the realization of the broader implications of sEH inhibition across numerous neurological disorders through its role in inflammatory pathways. The paper aims to illustrate the therapeutic potential sEH inhibition in neurological disorders through inflammation mediation.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Neuroinflammation is a symptom of nearly all neurological disorders, and occurs when the immune system of the brain is activated. Microglia, an immune cell in the brain, release inflammatory mediators typically associated with neuroprotection and neurogenesis. However, incessant inflammation can be associated with harmful effects and neurological diseases. Therefore, treatments that target inflammatory processes are of interest to researchers as they have the potential to alleviate numerous disorders. The soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme (sEH), an enzyme that modulates various physiological processes through the regulation of inflammatory pathways, is one such possible therapeutic agent. Research on the effect of sEH inhibition provides an avenue for treating different neurological disorders such as brain injury, depression, and Alzheimer's. </span>

<b>sEH and the Role of EETs</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The sEH enzyme is important primarily through its ability to metabolize fatty acids in inflammatory pathways. It is found across mammalian tissues, such as in the brain or the liver, where it is highly expressed. As a member of the epoxide hydrolase family of enzymes, sEH’s C-terminus is responsible for the enzyme’s characteristic epoxide hydrolase activity, converting epoxides by adding a water molecule. The N-terminus, on the other hand, has phosphatase activity instead [2]. Due to the different activities of the two sides of the enzyme, the N-terminal phosphatase domain has been linked to cholesterol metabolism, while the C-terminal domain has been associated with inflammatory and cardiovascular effects.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The epoxide hydrolase activity of sEH is performed on epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), epoxy fatty acids that act as lipid messengers in the body. Due to their nature as lipid messengers, EETs have numerous roles, such as being anti-inflammatory messengers and increasing vasodilation. An increase in EET levels provides anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects [2]. These protective effects of EET may be especially acute in the brain. For example, the inhibition of the cytochrome p450 enzyme results in an absence of EET, which reduces cerebral blood flow by 30 percent, indicating a critical need for EET in brain circulation [4].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Inhibition of sEH, a negative regulator of EET, increases these protective effects of EETs. The enzyme lowers EET activity via conversion to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), which have less anti-inflammatory effects, and can be pro-inflammatory instead. Numerous studies have knocked out or selectively inhibited sEH which stabilizes or increases EET activity because it is no longer being converted into DHET. It is through sEH’s metabolism of EETs that it is linked to numerous diseases and various physiological effects, as EETs are critical in controlling inflammation. Research on the possible therapeutic effects of sEH is therefore primarily focused on increasing fatty acid/EET levels through inhibition of sEH. </span>

<b>Inflammation in Brain Injury</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Neuroinflammation is a critical aspect of traumatic brain injury (TBI), or brain damage via physical injury. TBI results in cerebral inflammation, which activates microglia to produce post-traumatic inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species (ROS). While inflammatory mediators function as an immune response after injury, their overproduction after TBI can lead to neural damage, apoptosis (cell death) and/or brain edema (swelling due to the accumulation of fluids). This additional damage occurring in the brain stimulates an increased microglia response, resulting in a positive feedback mechanism [5]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Inhibition of this post-traumatic stress-induced inflammation is a common mechanism in treating TBI. Given sEH’s role in inflammation, deletion of sEH via genetic knockouts has been shown to improve these effects. Deletion of sEH decreases the number of activated microglia post-TBI, and as a result, reduces the release of inflammatory mediators, thereby reducing edema, apoptosis, and inflammation [5]. The rise in EET levels associated with sEH inhibition also results in anti-inflammatory effects, and possibly an increase in neurotrophic factors, or growth factors that have a neuroprotective effect [5]. </span>

<b>sEH and Alzheimer’s</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Neuroinflammation is also linked to both the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s. Prolonged activation of glial cells</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> astrocytes and microglia</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">increase proinflammatory molecules which lead to a “neurotoxic” environment that aggravates the disease [6]. Alzheimer’s patients have nearly twofold higher sEH levels in the astrocytes, leading to lower EET levels and thus lower anti-inflammatory effects [7]. Given the importance of inflammation in Alzheimer’s, inhibition of sEH should increase EET levels, promoting anti-inflammatory effects crucial to treating the disease. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">One experiment treated 5xFAD mice, transgenic mice that express Alzheimer’s phenotypes, with an sEH inhibitor TPPU. The results indicated that not only did the mice have increased EET levels, the inhibitor had also affected gene expression in the hippocampus by downregulating proinflammatory genes. This effectively “calmed” the overactive immune response correlated with Alzheimer’s. Further testing uncovered that these treated mice had fewer, smaller amyloid plaques, or proteins that are considered to play a critical role in Alzheimer’s and are often regarded as a biomarker for the disease, and fewer microglia surrounding these plaques [6]. As prolonged activation of microglia leads to proinflammatory effects and reduced phagocytosis of amyloid plaques, lowering the immune response of these glial cells could theoretically reverse these inflammatory effects. The reduction effects of EETs on ROS may also be involved, as ROS may contribute to neurotoxicity [7]. These results were achieved with TPPU and verified with another sEH inhibitor; it also aligned with results seen in genetic knockouts of sEH [6]. </span>

<b>sEH in Peripheral Organs</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to the brain, peripheral organs may also play an important role in sEH’s effects on neurological disorders. In addition to astrocytes and other glial cells, sEH is most expressed in the liver. With the liver being the largest gland and responsible for a variety of metabolic activities, hepatic sEH (sEH of the liver) has an influence throughout the body. In a study on major depressive disorder (MDD) by Qin </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, researchers used mice in a chronic mild stress model (CMS), where they were exposed to varying stressors to mimic the effects of depression in an animal model. They found that chronic stress increased sEH levels in mice liver, suggesting hepatic sEH levels are linked to stress and depression [8]. Increased sEH levels in these mice via targeted gene therapy not only led to depressive-like behaviors, but there was also a decrease in proteins that modulate synaptic plasticity, suggesting that sEH parallels the effects of stress at the molecular level. On the other hand, deleting the gene that codes for sEH in the liver induced an antidepressant effect in the CMS mice [8]. In other words, sEH induced depressive-like effects, and inhibiting sEH activity led to antidepressant-like effects, even in stressed model mice. These findings were paralleled in MDD human patients who had lower EET levels compared to the control group, suggesting higher sEH activity in patients with depression, again similar to the Alzheimer’s patients [8]. </span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Given the anti-inflammatory abilities of EETs, further development of sEH inhibitors has the capacity to affect the treatment of multiple neurodegenerative diseases which are associated with inflammation. In addition to those mentioned, other neurological conditions and disorders have also exhibited elevated sEH levels, such as Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, and seizures [6]. As these diseases have different pathologies, the cause for elevated sEH levels may vary and is still under research. Nevertheless, the implication of sEH in a variety of diseases expands the therapeutic range of sEH inhibitors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As seen in the aforementioned MDD study by Qin </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, peripheral organs’ usage of sEH may also be involved with neurological disorders, such as in the case of hepatic sEH. This not only points to a possible liver-brain axis or connection between the two organs, it also opens another avenue of research into the effects of sEH across the body. Diseases such as depression and heart disease have been implicated with sEH in previous studies, for example, and at present, sEH inhibition has been successful in decreasing blood pressure levels [9]. Development and further research into sEH inhibition and effects therefore have the potential to touch numerous conditions and parts of the human body. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The research regarding Alzheimer’s and TBI both implemented pharmacological sEH inhibitors, in which only the C-terminal hydrolase domain of the enzyme was affected while the N-terminal phosphatase activity was left intact [5,6]. As the N-terminal has been associated with cholesterol metabolism, its role in neurological disorders provides another possible area of study of sEH in treating these disorders. Genetic deletion of the gene that codes for sEH, as seen in the Qin </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> study, deletes both the hydrolase and phosphatase activity of the enzyme. Therefore, studies implementing sEH knockouts may have benefitted from the loss of the phosphatase activity as well as the hydrolase [9]. As a result, further research into different aspects of the enzyme broadens the possibility of its usage and potential. </span>

<b>Author's Note</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: I became interested in ways to bypass built-in lifespans after taking HDE 117, a longevity class with Dr. James Carey. During the course of the class, I was exposed to many different ways to extend the human lifespan. However, I was most interested in cryogenics and its prospects of human rejuvenation, prompting me to explore the possibilities of human cryopreservation. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Summary</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This paper is focused on exploring the prospects of human cryopreservation. The first section discusses cryogenics and its relevance in the discussion of human cryopreservation. The following section utilizes empirical modeling to support the relationship between temperature and reaction rates. Next, the paper discusses the cryopreservation procedure itself and explores how the definition of death can be reimagined. We then transition to discussing cryopreservation's possibility for rejuvenation. Specifically, we redefine the definition of aging itself and discuss aging phenomena on the molecular scale and use both of these as a basis for the discussion of immortality. The succeeding section is concerned with the limitations of human cryopreservation. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the possible future of cryogenic technology. </span>

<strong>Cryogenics</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Cryogenics is a field of study focused on material behaviors at very low temperatures, ranging from -150</span><span style="font-weight: 400">°C</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to -273</span><span style="font-weight: 400">°C</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. At these extremely low temperatures, chemical properties are altered, and molecular interactions are halted [1]. By halted, it is not correct to say that all molecular interactions have been stopped. Rather, the molecular interactions have come as close to theoretically possible to ceasing and are at the lowest possible energy state. At these temperatures, chemical properties are also altered and unique phenomena emerge, allowing for extensive applications, most notably human cryopreservation. Because heat is related to the motion of particles, at these temperatures the biochemical activities within living systems are effectively reduced [9]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The prospects for preserving an individual at extremely cold temperatures have been increasing throughout the years as research within the field continues to develop</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. As of now, human cryopreservation seems more of a speculation than reality. Freezing an individual is one thing, but there is no guarantee that the individual will wake up from such an extensive period of suspension. Although extremely low temperatures serve as an appropriate basis for human cryopreservation, many more factors must be considered to avoid consequences that may occur during the procedure and after revival.</span><b></b>

<strong>Empirical Modeling</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The rates of biochemical processes at extremely low temperatures can be modeled mathematically [4]. The Arrhenius equation, proposed by Arrhenius in 1889, establishes a relationship between temperature and reaction rates. In figure 1, K is the reaction rate, E</span><span style="font-weight: 400">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> is the activation energy, A is the frequency factor (related to the orientations of molecules necessary to produce a favorable reaction), R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature. Manipulating the equation, we produce a form that directly shows the relationship between the reaction rate and temperature, as depicted in Figure 2. We will use the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase to illustrate the relationship between K and T [4]. With its activation energy defined as 54, 810 J/mol, we can explore the enzyme's reaction rate at a 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400">°C difference. With T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> at 40°C and 30°C respectively, we get a reaction rate ratio of 2.004. This tells us that a 10°C difference is enough to cut the reaction rate of the enzyme exactly in half. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The relationship between reaction rates and temperature, as expressed by the Arrhenius equation, lends weight to the viability of cryopreservation. If a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">10°C difference is enough to cut a reaction rate in half, imagine how much the reaction rate would be reduced within cryonically preserved individuals at extremely low temperatures. Furthermore, the biochemical processes that are occurring in the body at these levels are paused—not in the sense of being physically stopped, but rather the time needed for the processes to go to completion is relatively infinite. </span>

<strong><span style="font-size: 16px">Human Cryopreservation</span></strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 16px">By understanding that at these extremely low temperatures, biochemical reaction rates are suppressed, the practice of cryogenically preserving a whole individual became a reality [14]. For this process to begin, the individual must be induced in the death state. Once an individual enters the initial stages of death, the human body initiates its decomposition phase. The body’s cell walls begin to break down and in turn, release digestive enzymes that process the tissues in the body [11]. Because the body begins to break down at such a rapid pace, it is imperative that the patient, once induced in the death stage, be worked on immediately.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> The process of chilling the human body to extremely low temperatures is a delicate and slow process and is very important in the initial steps of the cryopreservation procedure. Once the patient arrives in the death state, the circulation and respiration of the cryonic subject is restored and they are ready to be cooled </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[4]. First, the subject's blood is replaced with 10% cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation. A small percentage of cryoprotectants are added initially to avoid an elevated osmotic shrinking response. Once the intracellular and extracellular cryoprotectant volume reaches equilibrium, the cells are ready for cooling which is done at a very slow pace (1°C/min) [5].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The cryoprotectant used typically consists of nutritional salts, buffers, osmogens, and apoptosis inhibitors, ingredients necessary in the maintenance of isotonic concentrations of the cell [5]. In doing so, cells within the human body can avoid swelling and shrinking. Additionally, another key formulation of cryoprotectant mixture is non-penetrating cryoprotectants which are typically large molecular polymers. These play a large part in the inhibition of ice growth and prevention of injury due to being subjected to the extreme cold [5]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To understand the prospects of human cryopreservation, it is helpful to redirect ourselves back to the definition of death. In 1988, the scientific community reviewed and redefined the definition of death from being in cardio-respiratory arrest to brain death [8]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In cryonically preserved patients, the extremely cold temperatures are thought to preserve the neural structures, which store long-term memory and the identity of the person</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In this way, utilizing extremely low temperatures to preserve neural structures and prevent them from being compromised is a prospect worth noting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Individuals who are cryonically preserved should not be viewed as being dead or alive, but rather be viewed as being temporarily suspended in time</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [8]. The normal cycles of biological processes such as growth and decay are paused, providing an opportunity for resuscitation and reanimation in the future [10]. To give a new perspective, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">cryopreservation can be viewed similarly to frozen embryos: just as embryos preserved in extremely cold temperatures gain life once implanted in a uterus, the cryopreserved patient may reenter the living state through the process of human reanimation. </span>

<b>Prospects for Immortality</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The process of human cryopreservation aims to allow individuals to escape imminent death by first being induced into a transient death state [8]. Essentially, individuals are given the opportunity to bypass human mortality. Dr. James Hiram Bedford, a former psychology professor at UC Berkeley had his life threatened by renal cancer. He decided to undergo the cryopreservation process and became the first human to be cryonically preserved in 1967 [13]. By agreeing to enter this process, he hoped that, in the future, technology would be advanced enough to revive him and cure his illness. Ever since interests in cryopreservation have increased substantially, and as of 2014, about 250 corpses have been cryogenically preserved in the US [13].</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Shifting Views on Aging</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Aging is a degradative process that entails a whole array of pathologies. If we were to view aging as a disease itself that can be treated, cryopreservation opens a wide range of possibilities. Specifically, the process of cryopreservation allows an individual to avoid the effects of aging pathologies by having the opportunity to be treated once technology has advanced enough. This provides hope to bypass the mechanically built-in lifespans of humans, and essentially, provides prospects for immortality.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">On a larger scale, as we age, the probability of dying increases significantly [7]. To put it simply, as we age, there are more health factors in place to compete for our lives and the chance of survival through older ages decreases. In such cases, aging can be correlated with functional decline. Similarly, on the molecular scale, aging can be seen as a direct consequence of telomere shortening [6]. Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that exist at the ends of chromosomes and are essential to the integrity of our DNA. During the process of DNA replication, telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes and prevent loss of genetic information [16]. However, as we age, and as our body continues to undergo DNA replication, the telomeres shorten leading to the joining of ends of various chromosomes, pathological cell division, genomic instability and apoptosis. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In short, the health consequences that come with aging are inevitable but human cryopreservation can be seen to offset these inevitable aging phenomena.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The process allows an individual who is suffering from a presently incurable disease to be temporarily frozen in time. In this way, they may be revived when society is advanced enough to deal with the disease successfully. In essence, the human cryopreservation process can be seen to bypass inevitable health consequences, providing rejuvenating possibilities for any individual.</span>

<b>Technological Limitations </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although successfully preserving an individual through extreme temperatures is certainly an exciting prospect, little evidence exists to indicate that successful preservation and remanimation is possible [15]. At present, there are many challenges that need to be overcome to even support the viability of such an extensive process. According to Professor Armitage, the director of tissue banking at the University of Bristol, preserving the whole human body is an entirely new challenge [15]. Society is not even at the stage of cryopreserving organs. Organs, alone, are very complex, containing different types of cells and blood vessels that all need to be preserved. Similarly, Barry Fuller, another professor at the University of College London, has stated that before exploring the prospects of human cryopreservation, society must be able to demonstrate that human organs can be cryopreserved for transplantation [15]. Hence, as of current, there is close to zero evidence that a whole human body can survive cryopreservation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In the previous section, we discussed the arrhenius equation which derived the relationship between temperature and metabolic rates. However, the equation itself does not explore the consequences of raising the temperature of the human body during reanimation. While thawing, the frozen tissues and cells can experience physical disruptions which can damage them [3]. To a greater extent, an individual's epigenetic markers can even be affected, causing epigenetic reprogramming, which can change the expression of certain genes. However, the biggest hurdle is the successful preservation of the brain. The human brain is arguably one of the most important organs in the body, and cryopreservation must be successful in preserving the integrity of the neural structures. Prospects of successfully cryopreserving whole human brains are slim due to minimal research. Moreover, experiments with frozen whole animals' brains have not been reported since the 1970s [3]. Obviously, research on this matter is severely limited.</span>

<b>Discussion </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the overwhelming uncertainties surrounding human cryopreservation and society's current limits, the prospects of being able to defy death or possibly avoiding it in the future are becoming a topic of increasing interest. When an individual is brought to the brink of death, the uncertainties around the cryopreservation procedure, specifically its unproven track record of success, seem inconsequential in the long run. If society were to overlook the field of preservation based purely on unsubstantiated results and the unlikelihood of success, advancements would never occur. All in all, the increase in technological advancements and research within cryogenics is making the prospects of reviving a frozen individual in the future ever so likely. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">By Tammie Tam, Microbiology ‘22</span>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Since taking the class One Health Fundamentals (PMI 129Y), I have been acutely aware of this One Health idea that the health of humankind is deeply intertwined with the health of animals and our planet. This COVID-19 pandemic has been a perfect model as a One Health issue. Through this article, I hope to introduce readers to a fuller perspective of COVID-19 as a zoonotic disease.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated into a human tragedy, measured daily by an increasing number of infection cases and a piling death toll. Yet, to understand the current and future risks of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, one must account for the virus’s relationship with animals in the context of its zoonotic nature, as the transmission between animals and humans is often overlooked. Uncovering the range of intermediary hosts of the virus may provide clues to the virus’s origin, point to potential reservoirs for a mutating virus, and help inform future public health policies. As a result, a small but growing body of researchers is working to predict and confirm potential human-animal transmission models.</span>

<b>The origin of the SARS-CoV-2</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other disease detectives are still working to unravel the complete origin of the virus. Scientists have narrowed down the primary animal reservoir for the virus through viral genomic analysis, between strains of human and animal coronaviruses [1]. They suspect bats to be the most likely primary source of the virus because the SARS-CoV-2 strain is a 96.2 percent match for a bat coronavirus, bat-nCoV RaTG13 [1]. Despite the close match, the differences in key surface proteins between the two viruses are distinct enough to suggest that the bat coronavirus had to have undergone mutations through one or more intermediary hosts in order to infect humans [2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To identify potential intermediate hosts, scientists are examining coronaviruses specific to different animal species [1]. If SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to another animal-specific coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 may also possess similar viral proteins to the animal-specific coronaviruses. With similar proteins, similar host-virus interactions can theoretically take place, allowing for SARS-CoV-2 to infect the animal in question. For example, besides bats, a pangolin coronavirus, pangolin-nCoV, has the second highest genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2, which positions the pangolin as a possible intermediate host [3]. Because of the similarity, viral proteins of the pangolin coronavirus can interact with shared key host proteins in humans just as strongly as in pangolin [4]. However, more epidemiological research is needed to determine whether a pangolin had contracted coronavirus from a human or a human had contracted coronavirus from a pangolin. Alternatively, the intermediate host could have been another animal, but there are still no clear leads [1]. </span>

<b>What it takes to be a host for SARS-CoV-2</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In any viable host, the SARS-CoV-2 virus operates by sneaking past immune defenses, forcing its way into cells, and co-opting the cell’s machinery for viral replication [5]. Along the way, the virus may acquire mutations—some deadly and some harmless. Eventually, the virus has propagated in a high enough quantity to jump from its current host to the next [5].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Most importantly for the virus to infect a host properly, the virus must recognize the entranceway into cells quickly enough before the host immune system catches on to the intruder and mounts an attack [5]. SARS-CoV-2’s key into the cell is through its spike glycoproteins found on the outer envelope of the virus. Once the spike glycoproteins interact with an appropriate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor found on the host cell surfaces, the virus blocks the regular functions of the ACE2 receptor, such as regulating blood pressure and local inflammation [6,7]. At the same time, the interaction triggers the cell to take in the virus [5]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Since the gene encoding for the ACE2 receptor is relatively similar among humans, the virus can travel and infect the human population easily. Likewise, most animals closely related to humans like great apes possess a similar ACE2 receptor in terms of structure and function, which allows SARS-CoV-2 a path to hijack the cells of certain non-human animals [8]. Despite the overall similar structure and function, the ACE2 receptor varies between animal species at key interaction sites with the spike glycoproteins due to natural mutations that are kept to make the ACE2 receptor the most efficient in the respective animal. Thus, while there are other proteins involved in viral entry into the host cells, the ACE2 receptor is the one that varies between animals and most likely modulates susceptibility to COVID-19 [9]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, scientists are particularly interested in the binding of the ACE2 receptor with the viral spike glycoprotein because of its implications for an organism’s susceptibility to COVID-19. Dr. Xuesen Zhao and their team from Capital Medical University examined the sequence identities and interaction patterns of the binding site between ACE2 receptors of different animals and the spike glycoproteins of the SARS-CoV-2 [10]. They reasoned that the more similar the ACE2 receptor of an animal is to humans, the more likely the virus could infect the animal. For example, they found ACE2 receptors of rhesus monkeys, a closely related primate, had similar interaction patterns as humans [10]. Meanwhile, they found rats and mice to have dissimilar ACE2 receptors and poor viral entry [10].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While entrance into the cell is a major part of infection, there are other factors to also consider, such as the ability for viral replication to subsequently take place [11]. With so many different organisms on the planet, the models simply provide a direction for where to look next. SARS-CoV-2 is unable to replicate efficiently in certain animals despite having the entrance key to get in. For example, the virus is able to replicate well in ferrets and cats, making them susceptible to the virus [12]. In dogs, the virus can only weakly replicate. Meanwhile in pigs, chickens, and ducks, the virus is unable to replicate [12]. Outside of the laboratory, confirmed cases in animals include farm animals such as minks; zoo animals such as gorillas, tigers, lions, and snow leopards; and domestic animals such as cats and dogs [13].</span>

<b>The future for SARS-CoV-2</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the multitude of intermediary hosts, COVID-19 is unlikely to disappear for good even if every person is vaccinated [14]. Viral spillover from human to animal can spill back to humans. Often, as the virus travels through a new animal population, the virus population will be subjected to slightly different pressures and selected for mutations that will confer a favorable advantage for virus survival and transmission within the current host population [15]. Sometimes, this could make the virus weaker in humans. However, there are times when the virus becomes more virulent and dangerous to humans if it spills back over from the animal reservoir [15]. Consequently, it is important to understand the full range of hosts in order to put in place preventative measures against viral spillover. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As of now, most of the known susceptible animals usually do not get severely sick with some known exceptions like minks [1]. Nevertheless, people must take precautions when interacting with animals, since research into this area is still developing and there are many unknown factors involved. This is especially important for endangered species to not become sick, because they already face other threats that make them vulnerable to extinction [8]. As a result, some researchers are taking it into their own hands to keep certain animals safe. For example, after the San Diego Zoo’s resident gorillas contracted COVID-19 in January, the zoo proactively began using the experimental Zoetis vaccine to vaccinate their orangutans and bonobos, which are great apes that are considered closely related to humans and susceptible to COVID-19 [16]. Due to an assumed COVID-19 immunity in the gorillas and a limited supply of the Zoetis vaccines, they decided to not vaccinate the gorillas [16]. Now, scientists are trying to modify the Zoetis vaccine for minks, because minks are very susceptible to severe symptoms from COVID-19 and have shown to be able to transmit the virus back to humans [17]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Besides the virus mutating into different variants through basic genetic mutations, people must be cautious of potential new coronaviruses which can infect humans [18]. The human population has encountered other novel coronaviruses over the past several years, so it is not out of the question. In animals, if two coronaviruses of a human and an animal infect the same animal host, it could cause a recombination event and create a new hybrid coronavirus [19]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">For the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Dr. Maya Wardeh and their team at the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">University of Liverpool </span><span style="font-weight: 400">found over 100 possible host species where recombination events could take place [18]. These hosts are animals who can contract two or more coronaviruses with one of them being the SARS-CoV-2 virus. For instance, the lesser Asiatic yellow bat, a well-known host of several coronaviruses, is predicted to be one of these recombination hosts [18]. Also, species closer to home such as the domestic cat is another possible recombination host [18]. While it will take many different rare events, from co-infection to human interaction with the particular animal for recombination to be possible, scientists are on the lookout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Even without a full picture, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) understands the potential risks of animal reservoirs and advises COVID-19-infected patients to stay away from animals—wildlife or domestic—to prevent spillover [20]. COVID-19 has also brought to light zoonotic disease risks from illegal animal trades and wet markets. Once research into the human-animal transmission model becomes more well-developed, public health officials will have a clearer picture as to how the pandemic spiraled to its current state and help develop policies to prevent it from happening again. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">By Daniel Erenstein, Neurobiology, Physiology &amp; Behavior ‘21</span>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I first learned about research on the oral microbiome while covering this year’s annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in February. Under the theme of “Understanding Dynamic Ecosystems,” the conference, which was held virtually, welcomed scientists, journalists, students, and science enthusiasts for four days of sessions, workshops, and other talks. The human microbiome, home to trillions of bacteria and other microbes, is as dynamic an ecosystem as they come. This article focuses on the bacteria that live in our mouths and their fascinating role in diseases such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease. With this article, I hope that readers consider further reading on the diverse, lively ecosystems within our bodies. For more stories on the microbiome, The Aggie Transcript is a great </span><a href="https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/?s=microbiome"><span style="font-weight: 400">place</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to start.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">There is more to the oral microbiome than meets the mouth. Established within a few minutes of birth, this diverse </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3426293/"><span style="font-weight: 400">community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of bacteria, fungi, and other microbes lives on every surface of our mouths throughout our lives [1]. For decades, scientists have researched these microorganisms and their role in dental diseases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">But far less is known about the interactions of these bacteria and their products with other parts of the body, and these interactions could hold a particularly important role in human health.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve always thought of the mouth as somehow in isolation, that oral health does not somehow impact the rest of the body,” said Purnima Kumar, DDS, MS, PhD, professor of periodontology at Ohio State University, during a session at the American Association for the Advancement of Science </span><a href="https://meetings.aaas.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">annual meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that took place on February 8 [2].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Scientists, though, are increasingly looking to the </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503789/"><span style="font-weight: 400">oral microbiome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for answers to questions about health and disease [3].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“The time is absolutely right for us to start putting the mouth back into the body,” Kumar said during the session “Killer Smile: The Link Between the Oral Microbiome and Systemic Disease.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Panelists highlighted three systemic diseases — </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31850631/"><span style="font-weight: 400">diabetes mellitus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019644/"><span style="font-weight: 400">rheumatoid arthritis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/2/495/htm"><span style="font-weight: 400">Alzheimer’s disease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> — and their unexpected connection to disturbances in the oral microbiome [4-6]. A common thread running through all three diseases is an association with </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3590713/"><span style="font-weight: 400">periodontitis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a gum disease triggered by the accumulation of bacteria, viruses, and even fungi in dental biofilm, or plaque, on the surface of teeth [7].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In health, there is peace between oral microbes and our immune system. Healthy and frequent communication — molecular diplomacy between bacteria and immune surveillance — maintains stable relations. But microbial imbalances due to bacterial buildup in plaque can cause inflammatory immune reactions, resulting in the gradual breakdown of the barrier between biofilm and gum tissue.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“When you have gum disease, that crosstalk, that communication, that harmony is broken down,” Kumar said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When bacteria subsequently </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32385883/"><span style="font-weight: 400">invade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> our gum tissues, there are consequences for human disease [8].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Mark Ryder, DMD, professor of periodontology at University of California, San Francisco, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32533852/"><span style="font-weight: 400">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the role of one such bacterium, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Porphyromonas gingivalis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, in disease [9]. This bacterium</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">secretes enzymes called gingipains, which are essential for its survival.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In the case of Alzheimer’s disease, these gingipains can travel through the bloodstream, cross the blood-brain barrier, and accumulate in brain regions like the hippocampus, which is involved in memory. There, they help break down an embedded membrane protein called amyloid precursor protein into fragments, which group together in deposits found in people with Alzheimer’s disease.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Further study of gingipains and other microbial products could provide insight into a “critical early event in the initiation and progression of Alzheimer’s disease,” Ryder said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Similarly, </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29513935/"><span style="font-weight: 400">rheumatoid arthritis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> can be triggered by immune responses to other by-products of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">P. gingivalis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, including protein antibodies that cause joint inflammation, according to Iain Chapple, BDS, PhD, professor of periodontology at the University of Birmingham [5].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Past research on links between the oral microbiome and systemic disease has even shown that these effects can travel a two-way street.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This is apparent in the research of Dana Graves, DDS, DMSc, professor of periodontics at University of Pennsylvania, whose </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31850631/"><span style="font-weight: 400">work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> has examined the effects of diabetes on our microbiome, and vice versa [4].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“Diabetes impacts the mouth in a very profound way,” said Graves, adding that the inflammatory responses to bacteria caused by diabetes lead to disruption of the microbiome.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“This bidirectionality is something we saw first with diabetes, we’ve seen it now with rheumatoid arthritis, and it appears now that we’re starting to see it with chronic kidney disease,” Chapple said. “We need to start really digging down into [biological mechanisms] to understand more about that relationship.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">However, the verdict is still out on how much bacterial products such as gingipains contribute to disease. For Ryder and others, the existing data is insufficient — fully answering that question depends on carefully constructed clinical trials.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“When we’re trying to establish a link between something like the microbiome and the mouth and Alzheimer’s, association studies are important, the actual underlying biological mechanisms are important, but finally what sort of seals the deal, of course, is the actual effects of intervention,” Ryder said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">An ongoing </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03823404"><span style="font-weight: 400">clinical trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with more than 600 patients is evaluating the success of gingipain inhibitors in preventing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease [10]. The results, expected by the end of this year, could carry implications not just for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease but any disease with underlying roots in the oral microbiome.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Regardless of the results, it’s clear that breaking out the toothbrush and floss every day is crucial to our overall well-being.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">By Macarena Cortina, Psychology ‘21 </span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> As a psychology major who used to be a plant biology major, I’m very interested in the arenas where these two fields interact. Such is the case with psychoactive plants and fungi that produce significant alterations in brain chemistry and other aspects of the human psyche. That is why I chose to write about psychedelics and their rebirth in both research and culture. In the past few months, I have seen increasing media coverage of new scientific findings about these substances, as well as legal advancements in their decriminalization, making this a relevant topic in the worlds of psychology and ethnobotany. The history of psychedelics is a long and complicated one, but here I attempt to cover the basics in hopes of demystifying these new powerful therapeutic treatments and informing readers about the latest horizon in mental health. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">After decades in the dark, psychedelic drugs are finally resurfacing in the world of science and medicine as potential new tools for mental health treatment. Psychedelics, otherwise known as hallucinogens, are a class of psychoactive substances that have the power to alter mood, perception, and cognitive functions in the human brain. They include drugs such as LSD, magic mushrooms, ayahuasca, MDMA, and peyote [1]. The US has a long and complex history with these drugs, and the resulting criminalization and stigma associated with them have kept psychedelics in the shadows for many years. However, a major shift in society’s opinions of psychedelics is taking place, and a reawakening is happening in the scientific community. Researchers from various disciplines are becoming increasingly interested in unlocking the therapeutic powers of these compounds, especially for those who are diagnosed with mental disorders and are resistant to the treatments that are currently available for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether or not the world is ready for it, the psychedelic renaissance has begun.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Psychedelics have been used by Indigenous communities around the world as part of their cultural, spiritual, and healing traditions for thousands of years. In the Western world, psychedelics were rediscovered in the 1940s by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann, who accidentally absorbed LSD through his skin while conducting tests for a potential medicine [2]. What followed was an “uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes, with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors” [7]. Once LSD was disseminated throughout the world, psychologists began to experiment with it as a psychotomimetic, or a drug that mimics psychosis, in hopes of gaining a better understanding of schizophrenia and similar mental disorders [2, 3]. In the 1950s, as a result of the US government’s fear that communist nations were using mind control to brainwash US prisoners of war, the CIA carried out the top-secret project MK-Ultra, drugging even unwitting subjects with psychedelics in an attempt to learn about potential mind control techniques [4]. Recreational use of psychoactive substances proliferated in the counterculture movement of the 1960s, eventually leading to their criminalization and status as Schedule 1 drugs [5]. This classified them as substances with no medical value and a high potential for abuse—two descriptors we know are not factual [6].  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Now, people seem to be reevaluating their outlook on these formerly demonized drugs and are instead looking for ways to harness psychedelics’ medicinal properties for mental and physical improvement. Momentum is building quickly. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Clinical trials are beginning to show real potential in the use of psychedelics for the treatment of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, eating disorders, and emotional suffering caused by diagnosis of a terminal illness.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved the use of ketamine for therapeutic purposes with MDMA and psilocybin set to follow [7]. Psilocybin has also been decriminalized in cities across the US and was completely legalized for medical use in the entire state of Oregon in November 2020. Entrepreneurs and investors are flocking to startups such as MAPS Public Benefit Corporation and Compass Pathways, which are currently developing psychedelic drugs for therapeutic application. Research centers have been cropping up across the country as well, even at prestigious institutions like John Hopkins School of Medicine and Massachusetts General Hospital. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">So how do psychedelics work? In truth, scientists still don’t know exactly what happens to neural circuitry under the influence of these mind-altering drugs. While more research is required to fully understand how psychedelics affect the brain, there are some findings that help clarify this mystery. For example, the major group of psychedelics—called the “classic psychedelics”—closely resembles the neurotransmitter serotonin in terms of molecular structure [8]. This group includes psilocin, one of the important components of magic mushrooms; 5-MeO-DMT, which is present in a variety of plant species and at least one toad species; and LSD, also known as acid [8]. What they all have in common is a tryptamine structure, characterized by the presence of one six-atom ring linked to a five-atom ring [8]. This similarity lends itself to a strong affinity between these psychedelics and serotonin receptors in the cerebral cortex, particularly the receptor 5-HT</span><span style="font-weight: 400">2A</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [8]. The implication of this is that psychedelics can have a significant and widespread influence on brain chemistry, given that serotonin is one of the main neurotransmitters in the brain and plays a major role in mood regulation [9].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">What follows is a poorly understood cascade of effects that causes disorganized activity across the brain [10]. At the same time, it seems that the brain’s default-mode network gets inhibited. British researcher Robin Carhart-Harris recently discovered this by dosing study participants with either psilocybin or LSD and examining their neural activity with the help of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Rather than seeing what most people expected—an excitation of brain networks—Dr. Carhart-Harris found a decrease of neuronal firing in the brain, specifically in the default-mode network. According to Michael Pollan, author of the best-selling book on psychedelics </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">How to Change Your Mind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, this network is a “tightly linked set of structures connecting the prefrontal cortex to the posterior cingulate cortex to deeper, older centers of emotion and memory.” Its function appears to involve self-reflection, theory of mind, autobiographical memory, and other components that aid us in creating our identity. In other words, the ego—the conscious sense of self and thus the source of any self-destructive thoughts that may arise—seems to be localized in the default-mode network. This network is at the top of the hierarchy of brain function, meaning it regulates all other mental activity [10].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">when psychedelics enter the system and quiet the default-mode network, suddenly new and different neural pathways are free to connect, leading to a temporary rewiring of the brain</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [10]. In many cases, this disruption of normal brain functioning has reportedly resulted in mystical, spiritual, and highly meaningful experiences. Psychedelics facilitate neuroplasticity, thereby helping people break negative thinking patterns and showing them—even temporarily—that it’s possible to feel another way or view something from a different (and more positive) perspective. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This kind of experience can be immensely helpful to someone who is struggling with a mental health disorder and needs a brain reset. While other techniques, such as meditation and general mindfulness, can help cultivate a similar feeling, they require much more time and effort, something that is not always feasible—and never easy—for those who are severely struggling with their mental health [10]. Psychedelics can help jump-start the process of healing, and their effects can be made even more powerful and long-lasting when coupled with psychotherapy [11]. Talking with a psychiatrist or psychologist after the drug treatment can help integrate and solidify a client’s newly acquired thinking patterns [11]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in April 2021, researchers found that psilocybin works at least as well as leading antidepressant escitalopram [12]. In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, fifty-nine participants with moderate-to-severe depression took either psilocybin or escitalopram, along with a placebo pill in both cases. After six weeks, participants in both groups exhibited lower scores on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16), indicating an improvement in their condition. The difference in scores between the two groups was not statistically significant, meaning that a longer study with a larger sample size is still required to show if there is an advantage to treating depression with psilocybin over conventional drugs [12]. However, one notable difference was that psilocybin seems to take effect faster than escitalopram [13]. As an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), escitalopram takes a couple months to work, something that’s not helpful for those with severe depression. Psilocybin, then, is suggested to provide more immediate relief to people battling depression [13]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In June 2020, a team of researchers at John Hopkins published a meta-analysis of nine clinical trials concerning psychedelic-assisted therapy for mental health conditions such as PTSD, end-of-life distress, depression, and social anxiety in adults with autism [14]. These were all the “randomized, placebo-controlled trials on psychedelic-assisted therapy published [in English] after 1993.” The psychedelics in question included LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, and MDMA. Following their statistical meta-analysis of these trials, they found that the “overall between-group effect size at the primary endpoint for psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo was very large (Hedges g = 1.21). This effect size reflects an 80% probability that a randomly selected patient undergoing psychedelic-assisted therapy will have a better outcome than a randomly selected patient receiving a placebo” [14]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There were only minimal adverse effects reported from this kind of therapy and no documentation of serious adverse effects [14]. When compared to effect sizes of pharmacological agents and psychotherapy interventions, the effects of psychedelic-assisted therapy were larger, especially considering the fact that participants received the psychedelic substance one to three times prior to the primary endpoint, as opposed to daily or close-to-daily interventions with psychotherapy or conventional medications. Overall, results suggest that psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective—with minimal adverse effects—and presents a “promising new direction in mental health treatment” [14].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">At UC Davis, researchers in the Olson Lab recently engineered a drug modeled after the psychedelic ibogaine [15]. This variant, called tabernanthalog (TBG), was designed to induce the therapeutic effects of ibogaine minus the toxicity or risk of cardiac arrhythmias that make consuming ibogaine less safe. TBG is a non-hallucinogenic, water-soluble compound that can be produced in merely one step. In an experiment performed with rodents, “tabernanthalog was found to promote structural neural plasticity, reduce alcohol- and heroin-seeking behavior, and produce antidepressant-like effects.” These effects should be long lasting given that TBG has the ability to modify the neural circuitry related to addiction, making it a much better alternative to existing anti-addiction medications. And since the brain circuits involved in addiction overlap with those of conditions like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, TBG could help treat various mental health issues [15]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As the psychedelic industry begins to emerge, members of the psychedelic community are voicing their concerns about the risks that come with rapid commercialization</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [7]. Biotech companies, researchers, and therapists should be careful about marketing psychedelics as a casual, quick fix to people’s problems. Psychedelics can occasion intense and profound experiences and should be consumed with the right mindset, setting, and guidance. There are still many unknowns about psychedelic use, especially its long-term effects. Not all individuals should try treatment with psychedelics, especially those with a personal or family history of psychosis. It will also be important to move forward in a way that is respectful to Indigenous traditions and accessible to all people—particularly people of color—without letting profit become the main priority. Some advocates worry that commercialization and adoption into a pharmaceutical model might strip psychedelics of their most powerful transformational benefits and that they will wind up being used merely for symptom resolution [7]. As long as psychedelics’ reintroduction to mainstream medicine is handled mindfully, the world may soon have a new avenue for effective mental health therapy that honors its Indigenous heritage and is accessible to all. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400">By Parmida Pajouhesh, Neurobiology, Physiology &amp; Behavior ‘23</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> The Coronavirus Disease has undoubtedly affected us in many sectors of our lives. There has been a lot of discussion surrounding the respiratory symptoms induced by the disease but less focus on how contracting the disease can result in long-term suffering. As someone who is fascinated by the brain, I wanted to investigate how COVID-19 survivors have been neurologically impacted post-recovery and what insight it can provide on more severe neurological disorders. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has drastically changed our lives over the past fifteen months. The viral disease produces mild to severe symptoms, including fever, chills, and nausea. There are individual differences in the length of recovery, typically ranging from 1-2 weeks after contraction [1]. Once recovered, those infected are assumed to be healthy and “back to normal,” but data shows that this is not the case for some COVID-19 survivors. COVID-19 has resulted in more severe long-term effects for patients, greatly affecting their ability to perform daily tasks. Taking a deeper look into the neuroimmunological side effects of COVID-19 can help explain the long-term symptoms experienced by survivors. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Developing our knowledge of long-term neurological effects on COVID-19 survivors is crucial in understanding the risk of cognitive impairments, including dementia and Alzheimer’s disease [2].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A team led by Dr. Alessandro Padovani at the University of Brescia recruited COVID-19 survivors with no previous neurological disease or cognitive impairment for check-ins six months after infection [3]. The exam assessed motor and sensory cranial nerves and global cognitive function. The results showed that the most prominent symptoms were fatigue, memory complaints, and sleep disorder.  Notably, these symptoms were reported much more frequently in patients who were older in age and hospitalized for a longer period of time [3]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Other symptoms reported include “brain fog,” a loss of taste or smell, and brain inflammation [2]. Researchers hypothesize that the virus does not necessarily need to make its way inside neurons to result in “brain fog” but instead claim that it is an attack on the sensory neurons, the nerves that extend from the spinal cord throughout the body to gather information from the external environment. When the virus hijacks nociceptors, neurons that are specifically responsible for sensing pain, symptoms like brain fog can follow [4].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Theodore Price, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Dallas, investigated the relationship between nociceptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein embedded in cell membranes that allows for viral entry when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to it [4, 5]. The nociceptors live in clusters around the spinal cord, which are called dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Price determined that a set of DRG neurons did contain ACE2, enabling the virus to enter the cells. The DRG neurons that contained ACE2 had messenger RNA for the sensory protein MRGPRD, which marks neurons with axons concentrated at the skin, inner organs and lungs. If sensory neurons are infected with the virus, it can result in long-term consequences. It might not be the case that the virus is directly entering the brain and infecting the sensory neurons. Alternatively, it is the immune response triggering an effect on the brain, which leads to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier surrounding the brain [6]. While this area of research is still under investigation, studies have shown that the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and lack of oxygen to the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Scientists are tracking global function to further understand the impact of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines on these neurological disorders. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding whether the cause of neurological symptoms is viral brain infection or immune activity is important to clinicians who provide intensive care and prescribe treatments [2, 6]. With future studies, researchers plan to further examine the causes of these symptoms. This knowledge will hopefully provide COVID-19 survivors with adequate support to combat these difficulties and reduce their risk of developing a more severe neurological disorder in the future.</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I wrote this review article during my time in UWP102B this past quarter, though my inspiration in digging deeper into this topic came from my personal experience with my uncle who had recently incurred a stroke to his brain leading him to face its detrimental effects. I realized I wanted to investigate the possible solutions there were for him and others, allowing me to consequently further my knowledge about this field of study. I’d love for readers to understand the complexity and dynamics that non-invasive brain stimulation therapies have on post-stroke patients, and its beneficial effects when used in conjunction with other therapies. Though studies are in their preliminary phases and there are quite a bit of unknowns, it is still important to keep in mind the innumerable therapeutics being created that target patient populations experiencing a certain extent of brain damage- their results are absolutely phenomenal.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">Abstract</span></span><span style="font-weight: 400">: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Non-invasive brain stimulation therapies have become an overwhelmingly dominant innovation of biotechnology that has proven to be greatly effective for treating post-cerebral damage. Stimulation therapies use magnetic fields that can induce electric fields in the brain by administering intense electric currents that pulse through neural circuits. Although several stimulation therapies exist, the therapies discussed in this review include the most widely used therapeutic technologies: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Post-stroke patients often experience significant impairments to their sensorimotor systems that may include the inability to make arm or hand movements, while other impairments include memory or behavioral incapacities. Stimulatory therapies have been shown to allow for certain neuronal excitability that can improve the impairments seen in these patients unlike alternative standardized procedures. Although the individual efficacies of stimulation therapies have shown viable outcomes, current research dives into how the use of stimulation therapies in conjunction with secondary therapeutics can have synergistic effects.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Introduction</span>:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Basic stimulation therapies were first put to clinical use in 1985 to investigate the workings of the human corticospinal system [1]. The magnetic field that is produced by stimulation is capable of penetrating through the scalp and neural tissue, easily activating neurons in the cortex and strengthening the electrical field of the brain [1]. By inducing depolarizing currents and action potentials in certain regions of the brain, patients with damaged areas of the cerebral cortex found great relief as they regained a degree of normal functionality in their motor, behavioral, or cognitive abilities [1]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In recent years, stroke has become the second leading cause of death in the United States [2]. Neurologically speaking, stroke can interrupt blood flow in regions of the brain, such as the motor cortex, weakening overall neurological function throughout the body [2]. Stimulatory therapies are used in these cases to successfully activate neurons which jumpstarts their firing capabilities and rewires the body’s normal functionality [1]. Although certain reperfusion therapies using thrombolysis have been seen to treat certain ischemic (i.e. hemorrhaged) tissue in stroke patients by removing deadly clots in blood vessels, these therapeutics are often starkly inaccessible to the general population because of their price tag and scarcity [2]. Oftentimes, even standard pharmacological drugs prove ineffective [2]. By way of heavy experimentation, scientists have discovered that the brain can simply reconstruct itself through a method called, “cortical plasticity,” allowing for neural connections to be modified back to their normal firing pattern [3]. By understanding this innate and adaptive tool that the brain possesses, researchers invented the method of stimulatory therapies to essentially boost our own neural hardware [2].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Over the years, by investigating how these therapies and their mechanisms can work in conjunction with other therapeutics on post-stroke patients, an in-depth understanding of further possible advantageous therapies can be made. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mechanism of Non-Invasive Neural Stimulation</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Most current noninvasive brain stimulation therapies use similar methodologies involving the induction of magnetic fields or electrical currents along cerebral cortical regions of the skull and brain to induce rapid excitation of neurons [4]. Some of the most common noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques currently used are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and theta-burst stimulation (TBS) [4]. Our brains reorganize innately after stroke or cerebral damage through mechanisms of cortical plasticity [3]. However, non-invasive stimulation therapies can stimulate cortical plasticity by quickly modulating neural connections through electrical activation for efficient neuronal and/or motor recovery after the incident [3]. According to Takeuchi </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al., </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">TMS and other similar therapies stimulate the cortex through the scalp and the skull. This method positions a coiled wire over the scalp to generate a local magnetic field [4]. As these magnetic fields are pulsed and begin to enter the brain, they establish an electrical current that stimulates cortical neurons which induces a neuronal depolarization (i.e. excitation) [4]. rTMS involves a similar mechanism as TMS, but it has a greater rate of repetition of the ejected magnetic stimulation inducing a higher frequency current [5]. Meanwhile, TBS therapy is a modification of rTMS. While TBS has a similar degree of frequency to rTMS, TBS involves larger bursts of magnetic stimulation rather than small, frequent action [6]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When understanding the degree that noninvasive brain stimulation works on cortical neural plasticity, it is best to see its functionality in the motor cortex</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400">one of the most easily damaged regions of the brain in stroke patients [4]. Neuronally, NIBS can excite the damaged hemisphere allowing for an increase in activity of the opposite or ‘ipsilesional’ motor cortex [4]. This excitement is highly inducible and is required for proper motor learning and functioning in normal human behavior [7,8]. In addition, these therapeutics may also induce certain metabolic changes that stimulate our innate neural plastic network for successful post-stroke motor recovery [4]. Over time, and with continuous electric stimulation therapy, long-term potentiation of our neural hardware can lead to swift recovery of the affected hemisphere [3]. By this method of magnetic stimulation on damaged cortical regions of the brain, post-stroke patients can recover faster than ever before. </span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">Excitability of Motor and Behavioral Neural Networks </span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, NIBS treatments induce excitability of motor and behavioral neural networks that allow for the atrophy of affected cerebral regions and increase neural plasticity in the region [5]. In a study led by Delvaux </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al., </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">TMS therapies were used to excite changes in the reorganization of motor cortical areas of post-stroke patients [9]. Scientists investigated a group of 31 patients that experienced an ischemic stroke in their middle cerebral artery which led to severe hand palsy [9]. The patients were clinically assessed with the Medical Research Council, the National Institutes of Health stroke scales, and Barthel Index on certain dates of experimentation after stroke [9]. From the data collected, when damaged regions were measured by electrical motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, the areas were initially statistically smaller than the unaffected areas, thus indicating a lesser degree of motor activation resulting from the effects of certain damaged regions of the brain [9]. After the affected regions were treated with focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (fTMS), a specific type of TMS therapy, the stimulation ultimately induced excitability of affected motor regions as well as unaffected motor regions due to the inducible nature of connected regions in the brain [9]. This study evaluates a TMS technique involving MEP amplitude measurements and FDI motor maps unique to most other stimulatory therapies, including rTMS, tDCS, and others, helping to physiologically understand the impacts of neurological damage in the brain. Although the study hosted a relatively small sample size of twenty participants, it  can be considered sufficient as per the extremity of the experimental design and scarcity of possible participants. The study participants, ranging between 45 and 80 years old, were tested for any underlying neurological disorders to reduce confounding factors. By testing these participants using a standardized scaling method and MEP potentials, the study qualified as a well-regulated results-directive for a conclusive study despite a relatively small sample size.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A similar study conducted by Boggio </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> further investigated the effects of NIBS on motor and behavioral neural networks by using variant-charged (anodal (+) and cathodal (-)) current stimulations on stroke patients and then identifying enhanced results</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">The investigation studied a specific brain stimulatory therapeutic (tDCS) on its excitability and potential benefits on post-stroke patients [7]. Investigators were able to test the motor performance and improvements in stroke patients using two experiments [7]. Experiment 1 was conducted during four weekly sessions using sham (controlled magnetic stimulation), anodal (increased magnetic stimulation), and cathodal (decreased magnetic stimulation) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) therapies [7]. In Experiment 2, five daily sessions of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">only</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> cathodal tDCS treatments were investigated on affected brain regions [7]. The effects were reported following the procedure and blindly evaluated using the Jebson-Taylor Hand Function Test, a standardized test to measure gross motor hand function [7]. Between the two experiments, the most significant motor and behavioral improvements were found using the three stimulations in Experiment 1 [7]. However, when stimulations were compared individually, viable motor functional improvement was still evident with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">either </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">cathodal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">or</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> anodal tDCS on unaffected and affected hemispheres respectively when compared to the sham tDCS therapy [7]. Using daily sessions instead of weekly was found to be more beneficial in terms of lasting treatment results [7]. Investigators were able to conclude that their findings show strong support in relation to other tDCS research on motor function improvement in stroke patients [7]. tDCS is considered safe, representative, and inexpensive allowing for the possibility of further research on the technique with a wider range of patients. The study could have included additional evaluations of the different motor capabilities rather than just focusing on the hand itself to allow for variation, additional variables, and details that could supply the research rather than simply validating the technique. Both experiments analyzed above resulted in statistically significant results and represented the excitable capabilities of stimulatory therapies currently used for post-stroke patients. </span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: 400">Effectivity of Alternative Neural Therapeutics in Conjunction with NIBS Therapies </span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although standard NIBS therapies have been shown to provide impressive solutions for post-stroke patients, there have been few studies understanding the prospects of using NIBS in conjunction with other therapies for these patients. Aphasia, a rapid decline of the ability to acknowledge or express speech, is a common neurological disorder often seen in post-stroke patients as a result of damage to speech and language control centers of the brain [10]. A number of therapeutics not only search for solutions to certain post-stroke motor dysfunctionalities, but also the behavioral dysfunctions of stroke including aphasias. For several years, previous studies have investigated the use of intonation-based intervention (melodic intonation therapy (MIT)), on severe non-fluent aphasia patients showing immense benefits [10]. A study conducted by </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Vines</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. (2011) expanded on these findings and implemented this therapy of MIT alongside an additional brain stimulatory therapy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to understand if there are augmented benefits of MIT in patients with non-fluent aphasia [10]. Six patients with moderate to severe non-fluent aphasia underwent three days of anodal-tDCS therapy with MIT and another three days with sham-tDCS therapy with MIT [10]. The two types of treatments were separated by one week and assigned randomly [10]. The study showed that compared to the effects of the sham-tDCS with MIT therapies, the anodal-tDCS with MIT led to statistically significant improvements in the patients’ fluency of speech [10]. The study was able to solidify that the brain can properly reorganize and heal damage to its language centers through combined therapies of anodal-tDCS and MIT thus revamping the neurological activity of non-fluent aphasia patients [10]. However, one important component that was lacking in this experiment was a large number of subjects for reliable results. With six patients in the study, scientists could have increased the number tested to allow for greater sufficiency and valid results. Although this study lacked in size, it did include a range of participant ages relieving confounding effects of age-related neurological differences. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">An additional study important to the investigation of understanding the prospects of conjunctive stimulatory therapy was conducted in 2012 by </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Avenanti</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> et al</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. The study sought to understand the possible benefits of combining non-invasive brain stimulation therapies (rTMS) with physical therapy. Many studies have investigated the effects of TMS alone on chronic stroke patients but few have investigated the combination of TMS with physical therapy.  In a double-blind, randomized, experiment, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Avenanti</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> (2012) investigated a group of 30 patients who were given either real or sham transcranial magnetic stimulations (rTMS) either before or after physical therapy (PT) [5]. The outcomes of this experiment were evaluated based on dexterity and force manipulations of motor control [5]. The results of the study found that overall, patients that were given real rTMS treatments developed statistically better behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes when used in conjunction with PT but were more greatly enhanced when stimulated before physical therapy in a sequential manner [5]. Improvements were detected in all conjunctive groups (real or sham/before or after PT), and even with PT alone in certain experimental groups [5]. Researchers were able to conclude that treating chronic stroke patients with motor disabilities with rTMS </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">before</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> PT provided optimal results of motor excitability, though its conjunctive outcome was effective as well [5]. With statistically significant results, the study indicates valid conjunctive benefits of both PT and rTMS therapy for the patients evaluated [5]. Regarding the reliability of this study, each method was properly implemented for results to be sustained allowing for proper controls in sham trials [5].  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Conjunctive therapies offer new insight into possible avenues for advantageous treatments for post-stroke patients rather than when used alone. With new investigations in this field of study, unknown outlets are slowly being uncovered, allowing for better solutions to cerebral and ischemic damage. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Conclusion:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) therapies are a well-refined and successful therapeutic for post-stroke patients. Although much of the mainstream solutions to damaged cerebral regions are NIBS therapies, current research is still searching to identify qualifying conjunctive therapies with NIBS to ameliorate treatments. Standard stimulatory procedures use measurable magnetic or electric currents to depolarize or excite regions of the brain to stimulate neurons for proper activity. By doing so, our innate system of neural plasticity works with this stimulation to enhance the recovery of damaged cerebral regions. In recent years, scientists have taken a step further and combined stimulatory therapies with additional stroke therapy to further enhance results. Although early research processes have begun, more studies and trials are necessary to provide for sufficient data to strongly confirm their efficacies, even when promising results have already been found. Several studies lack the number of participating patients, data, and resources needed to successfully prove these conjunctive therapies. Further understanding of these treatments through repeated trials, larger sample sizes, and statistically significant results may lead to a better understanding in the future of possible effective conjunctive treatments for post-stroke patients. </span>

<b>Author’s Note</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: This review was originally written for my UWP104F class in Winter Quarter 2021. While environmental allergies are well known to the public, many people are unaware of the social, mental, financial, and most importantly, physical costs of food allergies. I highly benefited from getting treated for food allergies through immunotherapy, so I want to make these methods more known. I want to raise awareness on the available non-avoidant treatments catered to food allergy sufferers and inform readers that these methods are important developments happening in the world of food allergy immunotherapy. This article will also explain the basic mechanisms of immunotherapy, the differences between each delivery method, the relative effectiveness of these methods, and the risks and benefits of each method. These factors should all be considered when recommending a specific method to an allergic individual.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Food allergies are becoming an increasingly common global health crisis. The various consequences of living with food allergies reduces the quality of life for those affected [1]. Aside from the immediate dangers of severe allergic reactions, there is a significant amount of social restrictions and anxiety involved. Dealing with food allergies costs American individuals and families </span><span style="font-weight: 400">25 billion dollars annually </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[2]. Avoidance diets are the most common way to treat food allergies, but they are statistically unsustainable: 75% of peanut-allergic children get accidentally exposed to peanuts by the time they are 5 years old [1]. As a result, allergy immunotherapy is an important developing preventative treatment that can allow individuals to consume allergens to improve quality of life. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There are three main emerging treatments: oral immunotherapy (OIT), sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), and epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT). All three use different delivery methods to introduce the patient to allergens to achieve desensitization. The different delivery methods may contribute to the different levels of success observed between them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The guiding principle of food allergy immunotherapy, regardless of delivery method, is to induce a state of prolonged desensitization–defined as an increase in tolerance threshold–to an allergen [3]. This may be achieved by maintaining consumption of allergen over time through doses tailored to the patient’s observed tolerance threshold. Tolerance thresholds are determined with food challenges, where the patient consumes allergens until they experience notable allergic symptoms [4]. Desensitization may be gradually achieved through increases in dosage [3, 4]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Allergen doses slowly increase over time as the patient’s tolerance increases. Administering the allergen this way is thought to familiarize the body with it so that the immune response to the allergen gradually becomes less severe over time [5]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Generally, the immune response to allergens is mediated by allergy-specific antibodies called Immunoglobulin E (IgE). Once a food allergen has been ingested and detected by the immune system, IgE activates immune cells that cause inflammation and other allergy symptoms. Immunotherapy attempts to change the immune response so that allergens stimulate non-allergy specific antibodies like Immunoglobulin G (IgG) [5]. IgG antibodies produce a normal immune response to foreign bodies like infections and viruses. Training the body to respond with IgG prevents the allergic response, eliminating adverse allergic symptoms. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Immunotherapy aims to create a state of long term desensitization known as sustained unresponsiveness (SU). </span><span style="font-weight: 400">By achieving SU, patients are more likely to retain tolerance even after they stop taking the regular, repeated doses of allergen. Patients with SU can often freely be in the presence of their allergens or even consume them </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[3, 4]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. SU is not considered a “cure” of allergies. Immunotherapy simply aims to change the Immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic response to a less drastic response that has little to no effect on quality of life [1]. SU is less commonly achieved than desensitization across all delivery methods, with only a small subset of patients reaching SU after years of therapy [6]. Nonetheless, SU remains the ideal end goal for all patients [3]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Delivery Methods</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Across all studies cited in this literature review, delivery methods vary in efficacy depending on the food allergen being treated. Discussing the efficacy of each method for individual food allergens would thus require extensive examination and comparison of many individual studies. This level of specificity is not necessary to explain or compare the efficacies of the three immunotherapies. The duration and safety of each treatment seems to widely vary based on the particular allergic response, tolerance threshold, and specific allergens of an individual. Despite these differences, however, much of the research yields consistent results in the overall relative efficacy of each method. As such, this review will describe a general consensus about the effectiveness of each delivery method across many studies. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Delivery Method #1 - Oral Immunotherapy</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The first food allergy immunotherapy delivery method, which has recently received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for peanut allergen [7] is oral immunotherapy (OIT). In OIT, the patient ingests allergen protein often in powder form and mixed with other non-allergenic food [5].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">OIT has yielded the most promising clinical results out of all immunotherapy delivery methods [5]. Most patients treated with OIT have reached desensitization, though SU is less commonly observed [3]. Adverse allergic reactions are reasonably likely to occur during OIT, though most reactions are mild. All reactions can be promptly addressed within a clinical or hospital setting. Despite this, individuals with severe and fast-acting allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis) may still face risks to their physical well-being [3, 6]. As of now, only an OIT treatment, known as Palforzia</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ⓡ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, for peanut allergen has been approved by the FDA out of all potential immunotherapies. At this point in time, it has passed clinical trials and requires additional risk assessments, education, and patient counseling for use [7]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Adjuvant medications–used in combination with a treatment to enhance or modify its effects are being examined as additional safety measures to make OIT safer. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody, an antibody cloned from existing antibodies that can be taken as medicine to assist immune functions. Omalizumab selectively binds to IgE, which occupies IgE enough to suppress the allergic response [8]. Omalizumab appears to have no bearing on the effectiveness of the desensitization process [3]. However, it has been shown to speed up the process and decrease incidence of adverse allergic reactions.  For common allergens like milk and peanut, little to no adverse reactions were observed when Omalizumab was administered to subjects [8]. However, further research and clinical trials with larger sample sizes and a wider array of allergens must be conducted before Omalizumab can be universally used as a safety protocol for food allergy immunotherapy [8].</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Delivery Method #2 - Sublingual Immunotherapy</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The second delivery method is sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). SLIT requires that liquid or dissolvable extracts of allergens be regularly administered under the tongue, held there for a time, and then swallowed [5]. Using this method, the allergen can be mainly taken into the body by way of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">antigen presenting cells in the sublingual mucosa found under the tongue.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> This route avoids enzymes encountered during gastric digestion that might change the structure of the allergen protein. This is useful in ensuring that the immune system becomes fully desensitized to the correct allergen [6]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">One advantage of SLIT is its safety; adverse allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are not commonly observed [5, 6]. Additionally, using SLIT before OIT is highlighted as a potential benefit. Patients who experience adverse reactions with OIT generally are advised to use SLIT as a stepping stone treatment. This lets them build enough desensitization to make OIT a more viable option, as they experience less side effects [5].</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Delivery Method #3 - Epicutaneous Immunotherapy</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The third delivery method in food allergy immunotherapy is epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT). Immune cells in the skin called Langerhans cells help introduce the allergen to the body when dermal patches are applied to the skin [5, 9]. Patches are kept on for increasingly longer durations and replaced as instructed by a physician until the patient is mostly unresponsive to the allergen. At this point, patches must still be worn to maintain results, but need only be replaced every 24 hours [2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Using this route to absorb allergens successfully prevents entry to vasculature, which is thought to limit severe systemic allergic reactions and only results in mild, cutaneous reactions [1, 9]. Similar to SLIT, this makes EPIT’s safety profile better than OIT’s. Additionally, EPIT does not place restrictions on the patient’s lifestyle and does not require close clinical observation like OIT or SLIT [2]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Comparing Delivery Methods</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As mentioned earlier, OIT is largely considered the most effective of the three immunotherapies described. Most patients are successfully desensitized and SU, though still infrequent, it occurs more often than other methods [3, 5]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SLIT has shown modest levels of desensitization, but is overall considered less effective than OIT, showing less immunologic changes over time [6]. It does not appear to confer high levels of SU [5]. It is unknown whether this is attributed to the fact that most patients appear to struggle with completing the recommended duration of treatment [9]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">EPIT also demonstrates levels of desensitization comparable to SLIT, with 28-50% of patients showing tolerance to their allergen on average [1, 2]. SU has not been well documented in either EPIT or SLIT [1], which seems to be the main reason why they do not have FDA approval [2]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusions</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Preventative food allergy immunotherapy has been a developing area of study due to a global increase in food allergy incidence [5]. Three prominent immunotherapy delivery methods have emerged with differing efficacies and safety profiles.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">OIT is widely considered the most clinically efficient and promising delivery method, since it consistently produces desensitization [5]. SLIT shows less consistent desensitization [6] and maintaining treatment is difficult for patients. EPIT shows similar results to SLIT [9]. While SU is not commonly achieved, it is more common in OIT [1, 3], which may explain why the only FDA-approved food allergy immunotherapy is OIT for peanut allergen [7]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The safety and convenience of each method may also affect patient choice. OIT may be the most effective and quick-acting, but it also runs the largest risk of adverse reactions, which warrants close clinical attention during treatment [3, 6]. In contrast, SLIT does not seem to cause many adverse reactions and is encouraged as a stepping stone treatment for patients that would like to move on to OIT once more tolerance to their allergen is built up. This practice seems to make OIT much safer [5] along with the use of medications like Omalizulab [8]. EPIT is also safer than OIT but has the added advantage of being a convenient and low maintenance treatment [5, 9]. At maintenance, dermal patches used for EPIT only need to be replaced every 24 hours, no clinical observation is required, and there are no restrictions placed on the patient’s lifestyle [2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As allergies become more common across the globe, more children struggle to adhere to avoidance diets and become vulnerable to accidental exposure to allergens </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[1]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Immunotherapy methods have developed in the hopes of increasing the quality of life of these food allergic individuals [1]. Future research may be able to improve on the observed effects and safety of immunotherapy. Ultimately, any progress will be able to help food allergy sufferers improve their quality of life. </span>

<strong>Authors’ Note: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">This literature review was conducted for the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment in the California Environmental Protection Agency under a contract issued to Dr. Michele La Merrill. We wanted to understand the current research on the reproductive and developmental toxicity of PFHxS, PFBS, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFNA, PFDA, and ADONA to draw conclusions and make recommendations for future policy and research. It is important to understand the health effects of substances such as PFAS chemicals that are present in our food, water, and consumer products to develop regulatory standards that protect public health.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Abstract</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals are used in the production of many industrial processes and consumer goods, and they have been widely detected in humans and animals. PFOS and PFOA have been comprehensively studied and are being phased out of use, but there are other understudied PFAS chemicals with effects that should be considered in regulatory affairs regarding public health and safety. In this study, we focus on the reproductive and developmental effects of seven PFAS chemicals: </span><span style="font-weight: 400">perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), 4,8-dioxia-3H-perfluorononanoic acid (ADONA), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). This literature review presents the observed reproductive and developmental effects of these chemicals on animal models, which can be used to help establish legislative priorities and draw attention to current gaps in published literature.</span>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Poly- and perfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals are widespread synthetic chemicals that are highly mobile, persistent in the environment, and are known to bioaccumulate in humans and animals</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.ho5l6ghaqqpg"><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.lypb2ocna6er"><span style="font-weight: 400">2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. PFAS chemicals have extensive use due to their unique anti-wetting abilities, as well as their ability to act as a surfactant, a molecule that lowers the surface tension between two liquids</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.vl1chq6p09c"><span style="font-weight: 400">3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. These properties have led to their use in oil- and water-repellent textiles, coatings, and fire-retardant products. PFAS chemicals can also be found in drinking water, production facilities and industries, and many commercial household products</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.ho5l6ghaqqpg"><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.4i0zl3mk43pe"><span style="font-weight: 400">4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Humans are mainly exposed to PFAS through their diet but are unable to metabolize these chemicals in their bodies</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.quku13sz3a7f"><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.ihdt75kvdk79"><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">These chemicals have found use in multiple industries for over 60 years</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.q6v36o80l6z8"><span style="font-weight: 400">7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. PFAS production peaked in the 1990s, with PFOS and PFOA being the most popularly used PFAS chemicals. However, after studies linked these chemicals to adverse human health effects, including damage to the immune system and liver, reproductive and developmental harm, hormone disruption, and cancer, the United States had voluntarily phased out their use</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.ho5l6ghaqqpg"><span style="font-weight: 400">1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.quku13sz3a7f"><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.lypb2ocna6er"><span style="font-weight: 400">2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. The industry has since shifted to favor PFASs with shorter chains, as these were believed to be less harmful to human health</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.q6v36o80l6z8"><span style="font-weight: 400">7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.o43o7uxyuvdo"><span style="font-weight: 400">8</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Although no association between chain length and toxicity has been proven, it is still being explored. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To this end, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and 4,8-dioxia-3H- perfluorononanoic acid (ADONA) have been increasingly used for industrial purposes as alternatives to PFOS and PFOA</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.ihdt75kvdk79"><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.o43o7uxyuvdo"><span style="font-weight: 400">8</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. These PFAS chemicals have shorter carbon backbone chains, so it is believed they may have less negative health effects than PFOA and PFOS, but this has not been proven. However, their health effects are not as well-explored as those of PFOS and PFOA, thus necessitating new research into the long-term health impacts of exposure to these replacement PFAS chemicals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Multiple epidemiological studies in humans have suggested that there is an association between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive and developmental health impacts. After exposure during pregnancy, lower levels of thyroid hormones T3 and thyroxine have been observed in both pregnant women and fetuses, as well as adverse birth outcomes and behavioral effects on children exposed in-utero</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.ihdt75kvdk79"><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.ufshsl94ois1"><span style="font-weight: 400">9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Some of these PFAS chemicals, such as PFNA, are being detected in both seminal plasma and breast milk of humans</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.29ene5uhk7ph"><span style="font-weight: 400">10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Individuals who are not fully developed may be more vulnerable to PFAS exposure and therefore, more at risk for any toxic effects. The purpose of this literature review is to survey reproductive and developmental effects of PFAS exposure to inform on potential literary gaps and future regulatory priorities. </span>

<b>Methods</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Search Procedure</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The research for this literature review was conducted by systematically choosing articles discovered through the search engine PubMed. The initial database of articles was created from searching the abbreviated forms of the chemical names (PFHxS, PFBS, PFHxA, PFHpA, PFNA, PFDA, ADONA) in PubMed using the filter “Other Animals” (</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.v80tbg1eh8qg"><span style="font-weight: 400">Table 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">). Only papers in English were considered for inclusion. An exception was made for ADONA due to our search yielding an excess of papers written by an author by that name. Instead the search term "ADONA NOT adona [author]” was used. Even with the reduced search, many of the results did not include the PFAS chemical ADONA, and subsequently, were not included. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Study Selection</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The titles and abstracts of each article were scanned for relevance to reproductive toxicity. This includes in vitro studies on isolated cells, different toxicological effects based on sex, responses affecting reproductive organs, and developmental effects in offspring. To limit the scope, this excluded human studies, bioconcentration studies that did not specify reproductive organs or unique developmental patterns, wildlife studies, and studies focused on other organ systems not in the context of reproduction or development. Additionally, we chose to exclude studies which used a mixture of chemicals or in which the PFAS chemical was analyzed as a metabolite of a parent chemical. This was due to the fact that it is uncertain which chemical actually caused an effect. Relevant articles were examined in depth to determine significant toxicological effects of the PFAS chemicals. The number of relevant articles in comparison to the total articles which arose from our search can be seen in </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.53a4rzbv73b0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Table 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Other notable responses, from papers which included reproductive effects, were denoted in our accompanying spreadsheet. Due to time constraints, the results for PFDA were summarized with less depth and were instead included as an appendix. </span>

However, the observation of reduced tadpole body length was only noted at a dosage of 1,000 µM of PFHpA, which is comparable to the LC</span><span style="font-weight: 400">50</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> value in this study, found to be 942.4 µM</span><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4ohjGLK7ihGwExZDphgUaVJbapTWL3r-w6CJdnkgmU/edit#bookmark=id.krgq3i2ndpft"><span style="font-weight: 400">28</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.

<b>Discussion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While the toxicity of PFBS, PFHxS, PFHpA, PFHxA, PFDA, PFNA, and ADONA, which are used as substitutes for PFOS and PFOA, is still being investigated, the current body of scientific research suggests that exposure to these PFAS chemicals poses potential reproductive and developmental risk to an organism.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In several species, PFNA exposure resulted in several effects that could interfere with normal procreation and aging systems. Observed deviations from control groups included embryo malformation, offspring mortality, altered behavioral patterns, morphological abnormalities, weight changes, and different hormone levels. There was evidence to suggest that males retain more PFNA than their female counterparts, and several studies suggested that male sex organs were impacted by PFNA exposure. Relative to the other PFAS chemicals studied in this paper, PFNA had a high amount of significant papers with reproductive and developmental effects. This may suggest that it poses a higher risk than some of the other chemicals, but it should be considered in the context that PFNA also had a higher number of search results than the other chemicals and therefore, may just be more well studied. A limitation in these findings that should be considered is the apparent lack of corresponding research on female sexual organs. Also, several effects were not observed to have a dose-dependent response, while others were only seen at lower concentrations. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">PFHxA only had five relevant studies and each used a different species as test subjects. Additionally, there were four studies, two used in the results of PFHxA and two not used due to a lack of significant results, which also did their experiments with other PFAS chemicals</span><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and in comparison, individuals dosed with PFHxA had milder, if any, effects. This suggests that PFHxA may have lower reproductive and developmental toxicity than other PFAS chemicals in this paper. This could be taken into consideration when assessing the risk of exposure associated with this chemical. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">PFHxS, similar to PFNA, had more toxic effects in males than females. Unlike the studies using PFNA, a majority of these did test both males and females in the same conditions. Exposed males retained a higher serum concentration of PFHxS for longer and displayed changes in anogenital distance and weight at a larger range of dosage concentrations than females.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There was one relevant paper that addressed the reproductive and developmental effects of ADONA exposure. This, coupled with the potential conflict of interest presented by the funding,  makes it impossible to draw any conclusions regarding the toxicity of this chemical. Even so, effects were observed from exposure to ADONA. These included changes in weight, mortality rate, and food consumption. To further understand the reproductive and developmental toxicity of ADONA, further research is necessary. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Multiple species demonstrated adverse reproductive and developmental health outcomes after exposure to PFBS. Alterations to hormone levels and morphological abnormalities were observed following PFBS dosage. Also, PFBS was seen to potentially influence hormonal sex changes in exposed fish. Several studies emphasized the impacts PFBS exposure may have on offspring. The above changes were seen in offspring after parental exposure, as well as alterations to egg development and the size of female reproductive organs. It was also noted that paternal exposure to PFBS tends to more negatively impact the health of offspring than maternal exposure does. Compared to other chemicals included  within this report, PFBS had a relatively high number of studies that met the requirements for inclusion. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Only two relevant studies were found regarding PFHpA, each using a different test species. These studies investigated the developmental effects of PFHpA on organisms exposed as embryos or tadpoles. Findings suggested that PFHpA may be teratogenic and toxic to developing organisms based on resulting morphological abnormalities and behavioral alterations in exposed organisms. However, no studies were found to investigate the reproductive impacts of PFHpA exposure, leading to a gap in the available research on this chemical.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The studies included on PFDA cover its effect on cell viability, hormone levels, and sex organs, as well the potential developmental toxicity and teratogenicity of PFDA exposure. However, within these studies, there are limitations. Multiple studies did not include information on the age at which organisms, usually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Rattus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, were dosed, making it more difficult to fully comprehend the effects of PFDA on stages of animal growth. Compared to several of the chemicals included in this paper, PFDA has a relatively higher number of papers that met the criteria for inclusion. Studies have been conducted on this chemical since the 1980s, far preceding work on some of the other chemicals in this report. Furthermore, while the effects of PFDA on hormones and the thyroid have been investigated in several studies, little work appears to have been done on the multigenerational and offspring effects of PFDA. Lastly, five of the sixteen studies investigated the effects of PFDA only on males, leaving further information on female-specific effects to be desired. Both multigenerational and female-specific studies could be considered potential avenues for further research.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, these PFAS chemicals have demonstrated that they may have potential for reproductive and developmental health effects, and their effects on humans should be investigated to ascertain human risk. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The objective of the present study was to compile and summarize the toxic effects of different PFAS chemicals on the reproduction and development of animals in controlled settings. While there are variations in the species used, as well as the method in which they were exposed and the concentration tested, exposure to all seven PFAS chemicals impacted aspects of development, and six had effects on reproduction. These effects should be considered in designing additional research on the outcomes of PFAS exposure and in assessing the risk of these chemicals on living organisms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Author’s Note: I initially wrote this literature review for UWP 104F in Winter 2020. I chose to focus on a topic that was, and is, very dear to me. I believe that readers would benefit from an overview of transgender specific health, as it is a subsection of science that is often unknown or overlooked. I wrote this while personally researching TGD healthcare and the availability of transitional therapies, and realizing firsthand the barriers to access, and lack of available information.</span>

<b>ABSTRACT</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals are people whose gender identity does not match the biological sex they were assigned at birth. Transgender is an umbrella term for many gender identities, and individuals may identify as male, female, or outside the gender binary. This population faces more barriers to healthcare access than cisgender individuals, or  people whose gender identity does match their sex assigned at birth. Lack of access to knowledgeable healthcare providers, as well as provider bias, creates an environment of hostility for a TGD patient. Transgender people have unique health needs that healthcare professionals must be educated on in order to properly serve this community. Emerging literature is beginning to identify health concerns among transgender people who have undergone hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that may require specialized treatment and attention. This review attempts to answer the following question: What does current research tell us about barriers and educational gaps in healthcare of transgender individuals, and what physiological differences in this population, compared to cisgender individuals, make this research important? Further studies are essential to properly providing healthcare to this population.  </span>

<b>Key Concepts:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Transgender and gender diverse, hormone replacement therapy, culturally competent healthcare. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>INTRODUCTION </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Historically, TGD individuals have faced many barriers to healthcare access—and many of these barriers still exist [1-9]. This paper aims to review the specifics of these barriers and educational gaps. Current research suggests that a lack of education from physicians and provider biases against transgender people are primary reasons why transgender individuals—especially TGD youth— struggle to access safe and culturally component heathcare [3,5-7]. Transgender people are less likely to seek healthcare, and if they do seek it, they are less likely to receive proper, unbiased access with educated professionals [1,3]. This review also presents literature on unique physiological differences between transgender and cisgender individuals in order to properly express why clinical research is needed to increase baseline education [10-16]. The critical health differences between the TGD population and other groups means a team of doctors and specialists—primary care physician, gender specialist, surgeon, and endocrinologist—must collaborate to provide culturally competent care. TGD individuals may choose to medically transition and undergo gender-affirming therapies such as gender-affirming surgery (GAS) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Given the nature of this topic, it is important to note that much of the research in this review is from ground-breaking preliminary studies that have not yet been repeated with larger sample sizes beyond initial investigation.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>DISCUSSION </b>

<b>Healthcare Access Among TGD Individuals</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">TGD individuals of all ages face challenges to healthcare on both a personal and institutional level. Increasing numbers of TGD people, including older adults, are openly living with their gender identity, meaning this is a critical area of research. TGD adults frequently struggle with insurance access; they are less likely to have insurance access compared to non-TGD LGBTQ+ individuals, and those that do have access are more likely to face healthcare discrimination [7,8]. One study found that individuals with Medicaid were more likely to be refused hormone replacement therapy, and more likely to lack a surgeon to perform gender-affirming surgery in their network, as compared to individuals with private insurance [7]. TGD adults who are part of other disadvantaged communities, such as being an ethnic minority or having lower socioeconomic status, face additional obstacles and higher levels of healthcare refusal [1,8]. Older LGBT adults are far more likely to have physical and mental health struggles than their non-LGBT counterparts, but older TDG adults are the most likely to have those struggles within the LGBT community [9,17]. Older TGD adults are more likely to live alone and have a community of “chosen family” instead of partners or children, which adds a layer of complexity to difficult end-of-life care decisions and increases senior care costs [9,17]. These circumstances show the need for thoughtful and individualized care for TDG individuals of all ages, necessitating competent and knowledgeable providers to navigate these sensitive topics. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Adolescence is a very stressful time in people’s lives, and recent literature shows that young TGD individuals are especially vulnerable [3,5,11]. Surveying the adolescent population directly allows researchers to analyze experiences and suggestions from youth to further improve healthcare. Currently, there is not much information on transgender youth, though the field of research has begun to grow rapidly in the past few years. In everyday life, TGD individuals are often misgendered or referred to as names that they do not identify with anymore. In the context of medical care, this leads to individuals being less likely to seek continuing care. Even without malicious intent, these actions may be incredibly damaging to the TGD individual. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In a medical setting, misgendering patients may foster unspoken feelings of distrust and alienation between the patient and their doctors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This is critical because transgender individuals are less likely to continue seeking routine and specialized healthcare if they feel uncomfortable in the medical environment [2,3]. In order for healthcare professionals to serve this population, practices must be as friendly as possible. Requesting and consistently using the individual’s pronouns and preferred name is a critical first step [2-3,5]. Surveyed youth suggested that healthcare providers should ask all individuals these questions, instead of only those known or assumed to be LGBTQ+ [2].</span><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This will lead to the subpopulation not being immediately singled out in a healthcare environment, as well as creating a welcoming space for patients who may not otherwise volunteer this information. Another suggestion was healthcare providers using gender-neutral decor in exam rooms [4]. In settings such as a gynecologist office, traditionally feminime or masculine imagery and furnishings can further alienate TGD individuals and reduce the likelihood of patient continuation. The language used in medical forms should be adjusted to encompass diverse gender expressions. Given the fact that many TGD individuals identify outside of the gender binary, medical records should allow patients to write in their identity rather than check one of two boxes [3].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">The gender binary is essentially the rigid classification system of two genders, male or female, a system which is commonly rejected by members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies. Since gender identity and the language that individuals use to express their personal sense of self is incredibly varied, giving patients more freedom to define and communicate their gender identity would allow them a greater sense of expression. This may also require reform of electronic healthcare systems to include this information, which is currently not common practice. In one study, the vast majority (79%) of TGD youth indicate they would appreciate the professional record of preferred name and pronouns [5]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">A common method of surveying the adolescent population is in-depth interviews of a small sample size. These thorough accounts of real experiences are very useful, as researchers can gain a more holistic insight into the individual’s life and experiences. The downside of this research approach is the small sample size, which may lead to results that are not as applicable to larger audiences as would be the case with a larger sample size. In order to best reach this population, researchers target LGBTQ+ programs, but for many reasons, a large subset of the TGD population cannot safely participate in those programs, and therefore are not included in reviews such as this. Voices of closeted LGBTQ+ community members in general are rarely heard, meaning this subset of the population is almost always left out. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Research also suggests that preferences regarding the inclusion of gender identity information in medical records differ greatly if the patient is closeted or “out”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">[2]. There are factors that should be taken into account with medical records disclosing transgender identity. For instance, a TGD minor may privately disclose their gender identity or preferred pronouns to their healthcare provider. If this TGD youth was not “out” to their parents, and the healthcare provider made a note, their parents might find this while viewing their medical records. This could potentially be damaging or even dangerous to the patient, so healthcare providers should be careful with handling such delicate information. Additionally, TGD care—especially for patients that are in the process of transitioning—involves many aspects of healthcare; a team of culturally competent therapists, physicians, specialists, nurses, and staff must all be properly informed to contribute to a holistically supportive team. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Sexual Health Needs </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Research into sexual health needs of young transgender people demonstrates TGD youth have unique sexual health needs that are not currently being met by their healthcare providers. Healthcare providers tend to be less knowledgeable about TGD-specific health issues, which differ from cisgender individuals [3,13,15]. Distinct aspects of TGD individuals include hormone replacement therapy (HRT), gender-affirming surgery (GAS), reversible puberty blockers, and same-sex STI transmission.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to previous generations, youth today are more likely to come out as transgender at a younger age, but many healthcare providers are not properly relaying healthcare information to their patients [3]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">When providers fail to relay crucial information to their patients, it poses risk to the patients that could otherwise be avoided. For instance, a doctor who is unknowledgeable on STI transmission among two people that were assigned the same sex at birth, or even a doctor with personal prejudices against TGD patients, might not inform patients of essential sexual health information, thus putting the patients at higher risk. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sexual education information for teenagers is lacking, and this issue is amplified for TGD youth, many of whom receive absolutely no relevant information from professionals and alternatively turn to unvetted online sources.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Healthcare providers need to stay up to date on the current literature for LGBTQ+ patients and have an obligation to confirm their patients receive adequate and age-appropriate information on topics of sexual health.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender men or non-binary individuals who have been prescribed testosterone, a gender-affirming hormone replacement therapy, may suddenly experience an ovulatory event after a long period of time [15]. Testosterone can stop ovulation by suppressing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal </span><span style="font-weight: 400">axis, but this research study is the first to show that after an extended period of time, such as several years, some individuals may “overcome” these suppressed hormones and suddenly ovulate [15]. This is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of because their patients may not be on contraceptives and will likely not expect this after suppressed ovulation. Unplanned pregnancy may result among patients who partake in sexual intercourse with sperm-producing individuals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healthcare providers have an obligation to inform their patients of medical issues such as this, as pregnancy for a transitioning TGD individual can be an extremely emotionally stressful event, especially in the face of body and gender dysphoria.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">An emerging branch of literature involves TGD patients and gynecological care. TGD patients are less likely to seek this type of care, and when they do, healthcare providers may have personal biases against treating transgender patients [4,6-7]. Transgender men or transmasculine individuals were found less likely to seek cervical cancer screenings, the main preventative test against cervical cancer. This is because of a variety of barriers on both a personal level and a wider institutional level. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">On a personal level, traumatic experiences with past healthcare, misgendering, and overall gender dysphoria contribute to transgender men not seeking cervical cancer screenings [4].</span><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Institutionally, research suggests incompetent provider education is a primary barrier to accessing satisfactory healthcare. This leads to a reduced number of transgender men or transmasculine individuals continuing cervical cancer screening [4].</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healthcare professionals should focus on ways to retain transgender men as patients throughout their transition and changing gender identity, as well as providing culturally competent healthcare to this population. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In a study on gynecological health of transmasculine people, healthcare professionals were surveyed on their willingness to provide healthcare to TGD individuals. It was found that personal biases and attitudes against TGD individuals were the greatest barriers [6]. This contradicts other studies, which indicate healthcare providers’ lack of knowledge to be the biggest obstacle to accessing safe healthcare. Professional training should account for transphobic beliefs among healthcare professionals [6].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Much of the research on TGD populations are groundbreaking pilot studies, and conducting more large scale clinical studies and research is highly recommended for improving healthcare for transgender individuals [2,5,17]. Another recommendation is to standardize inclusive and informed education on transgender topics in medical school curricula and continuing education programs [3,5,8]. Informed and supportive healthcare professionals are absolutely vital in addressing health and continued patient retention among TGD individuals. More research must be done to determine the extent of additional training needed to properly serve this population. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>

<b>HRT and Physiological Differences </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Literature has begun to explore and emphasize that physiological differences exist between transgender individuals who are undergoing gender-affirming hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and cisgender individuals [11-17]. Hormone replacement therapy is suggested to be gender-affirming to a patient with gender dysphoria by helping their body match their preferred gender identity, and has been found to be correlated with better body- and self-perception, as well as lower sexual distress [13].</span><span style="font-weight: 400">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This is incredibly important in increasing the holistic wellness of a transgender patient. Limited available research suggests that transitioned TGD individuals are at greater risk for certain cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks, compared to the general population [16]. When researching the impact of HRT on adolescents, one pilot study found key body composition differences in regards to cardiovascular health, suggesting this population has unique cardiometabolic needs that differ from both cisgender males and cisgender females [</span><span style="font-weight: 400">11,16</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]. Similarly, in regards to resting state network, individuals on HRT were found to have “intermediate” levels of physiological values unique and distinct from cisgender male or female individuals [11,16]. For the purpose of this paper, we can think of resting state networks as networks and patterns of activity between spatially separated areas in the brain, which are helpful in analysing organization, when the brain is not processing a specific task.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This information is preliminary—and it is important to keep up with developing research—but it suggests the extreme importance of larger repeat studies. Questions for further research include long-term effects of HRT on adolescents.  Additionally, research should be conducted on the distinct physiological values of individuals on HRT. In particular, do these values (the intermediate state) change the longer the individual is on HRT? If a patient were to stop HRT, would this “intermediate” state revert to values similar to their gender assigned at birth? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Another question to consider would be whether or not this intermediate state is reversible if the patient were to stop HRT for a period of time. However, such a question would bring up many ethical concerns for the psychological well-being of the study participants, as well as physical concerns of abruptly stopping medical therapy. One longitudinal pilot study found that transgender individuals on HRT had altered resting state functional connectivity in emotional, cognition, and sensorimotor ways after undergoing gender-affirming surgery [15].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">These studies suggest that the brains of TGD  individuals have the ability to form altered synaptic connections in a way that is different from cisgender people. Much more research is required in order to pinpoint any major connections and the implications of treating this population. These medical differences could be very important in areas such as proper drug dosage. Healthcare professionals must recognize these differences, and continue to push for more research to ensure transgender patients receive the competent care they need. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Much of this research contributes to some sense of a gender binary, given that this “intermediate” state is defined as being between “the two” genders; furthermore, a TGD individual may not aspire to follow a binary gender, and providers should be thoughtful and individualized in the language they use with patients.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The majority of these studies were composed of very few individuals. These results suggest that healthcare professionals must stay informed with research findings in order to keep their patients updated. </span><b>  </b>

&nbsp;

<b>CONCLUSION </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender individuals face discrimination in everyday life, as well as in the medical world. This is a large problem because transgender patients have specific healthcare needs that differ from cisgender patients and must be approached and treated differently. Many of these studies are pilot studies and were only published in the last several years. Several recent studies have attempted to classify barriers transgender individuals face, specific health differences, and what steps healthcare providers need to be taking. As research in transgender healthcare continues, it is important to note that not all transgender people can be grouped under one umbrella. Subpopulations exist within the TGD community, each with their own healthcare concerns, physiological health differences, and types of care they seek and receive. In order to better treat these populations, healthcare professionals cannot treat every transgender person with identical care. This emerging research, especially on topics of physiological differences, should not be used to discourage TGD individuals from their necessary transitional therapies. Rather, a more comprehensive understanding should help healthcare providers give their patients stronger, evidence-backed information about their medical choices. In addition, there are barriers that this discussion barely touched on, such as cost, insurance issues, and overall accessibility. Many more studies are required to identify the best ways to combat transgender barriers to healthcare access in order to address the physiological differences between TGD and cisgender individuals. </span>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Last spring, I enrolled in the inaugural offering of the University Writing Program’s wine writing course. Our instructor, Dr. Alison Bright, encouraged us to report on topics of personal interest through our news stories on the wine industry, viticulture, enology, and more. In this article, which was prepared for an audience of general science enthusiasts, I examine how biologists are making sense of a puzzling COVID-19 symptom </span><span style="font-weight: 400">— anosmia, or loss of smell — and what COVID-19 patients with this condition can do to overcome it. Eighteen months into this pandemic, scientists continue to study cases of COVID-19-related anosmia with dreams of a treatment on the horizon. I hope that readers feel inspired by this article to follow this in-progress scientific story. I extend my appreciation to Dr. Bright, who throughout the quarter shared approaches to rhetorical awareness that elevated my grasp of effective writing.</span>

<b>Image caption: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Anton Ego, the “Grim Eater” from PIXAR's Ratatouille, is reminded of his childhood by Remy's rendition of ratatouille, a Provençal dish of stewed vegetables.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">With a single bite of Remy’s latest culinary creation, the eyes of Anton Ego, a notoriously harsh food critic, dilate, and Ratatouille’s viewers are transported back in time with Monsieur Ego. The meal </span><span style="font-weight: 400">— a simple yet elegant serving of ratatouille, accompanied by a glass of 1947 Château Cheval Blanc — has triggered a flashback to one singular moment, a home-cooked meal during his childhood. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The universal charm of this enduring scene resonates; in Ego’s eyes, many recognize how our senses of smell and taste can impact a culinary experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Imagine how a real-life version of this scene might change for the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of COVID-19 patients who have lost their sense of smell [1]. Anosmia, the phenomenon of smell loss, has become one of the more perplexing COVID-19 </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">symptoms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> since first observed in patients during the earliest months of the pandemic [2].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">What happens when we lose our sense of smell? During the pandemic, scientists have studied smell loss, which affects more than 85 percent of COVID-19 patients according to </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joim.13209"><span style="font-weight: 400">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> published this year in the Journal of Internal Medicine [3]. In fact, anosmia is so common in COVID-19 patients that physicians were offered </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766523"><span style="font-weight: 400">guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for testing olfactory function as an indicator of infection last year [4]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To simplify studies of these complicated senses, taste and smell are often examined independently of one another, even though these senses are usually experienced simultaneously.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“Smell is just — it’s so crucial to taste, which means it’s really crucial to everything that I do,” said Tejal Rao, a New York Times food critic, in a March </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-smell-food.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">episode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of The Daily [5]. “And it’s really difficult to cook without a sense of smell if you’re not used to it. You don’t know what’s going on. It’s almost like wearing a blindfold.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Rao, who lost her sense of smell in mid-January after contracting COVID-19, began to search for answers to this mystery from scientists. Rao’s journey started with TikTok </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/02/dining/covid-loss-of-smell.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">“miracle cures”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and other aromatherapies </span><span style="font-weight: 400">— </span><span style="font-weight: 400">unfortunately, they were too good to be true </span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> but she eventually discovered the work of Dr. Pamela Dalton, a scientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia [6]. At the center, Dalton </span><a href="https://youtu.be/0pG_U13XDog"><span style="font-weight: 400">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the emotions that are triggered by our sense of smell [7].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">During simple colds or viral infections, smell is normally affected when the molecules in food and other aromas are physically blocked off from chemoreceptors in our nose by congestion. Scientists have also cited Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, head trauma, and chemotherapy as triggers for anosmia [8]. But a separate phenomenon was occurring in the case of COVID-19.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“COVID is different in that way, because most people who lost their sense of smell did so without having any nasal congestion whatsoever,” Dalton told Rao during an interview.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">One </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159120313581"><span style="font-weight: 400">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> published in October of last year by Dr. Nicolas Meunier, a French neuroscientist, aimed to investigate how the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, may disrupt sustentacular</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> cells [9]. These structural cells express the ACE2 receptor, which the virus hijacks to gain entry into our cells, at higher levels [10]. Sustentacular cells support the specialized neurons that transmit signals from the nose to the brain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When Meunier and his team at Paris-Saclay University in France infected hamsters with the virus, tiny hair-like projections known as cilia on the surfaces of olfactory neurons began to peel back from sustentacular cells. This disruption is a possible explanation for the difficulties with smell that COVID-19 patients experience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">If it is true that damage to sustentacular cells causes anosmia, loss of smell is not an irreversible brain condition. In this case, the poor connection between incoming odors and brain networks that typically process these stimuli is at fault, not direct damage to the brain itself. The sudden onset of smell loss in COVID-19 patients supports this thinking.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“It was just like a light bulb got turned off or a switch got flicked to off,” Dalton said. “And one moment they could smell. And the next moment, nothing smelled.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">But because olfactory support cells regularly regenerate, this loss of smell is only temporary, which allows for retraining of our senses. Two months of smell training, also known as olfactory training, allowed Rao to regain her sense of smell.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Olfactory training gradually exposes patients to particularly strong smells. Spices such as cinnamon or cumin, for example, were perfect for Rao’s first smell training session [5], and AbScent, a British charity offering support to patients with anosmia, sells kits with rose, lemon, and eucalyptus [8]. Scientists have </span><a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/np/2014/140419/"><span style="font-weight: 400">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that recurring exposure to these strong scents gives the brain time to recalibrate its networks, a feature known as neuroplasticity [11].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">But “you don’t just go from hurt to healed overnight,” Rao said. “It’s more like adjusting and learning how to live in a new space. That’s really just the beginning.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Our</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> chemical senses have the power to satisfy, to inspire, even to cause our memory to reveal itself, as 20th-century French author Marcel Proust observed in his seven-volume novel </span><span style="font-weight: 400">À la recherche du temps perdu, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In Search of Lost Time. Researchers have even </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/45/7/593/5869423"><span style="font-weight: 400">speculated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that our sense of smell can facilitate learning in other sensory domains, including vision [12].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While scientists further investigate how coronavirus causes loss of smell, olfactory</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> training can provide an avenue in the meantime for COVID-19 patients to recover this crucial sense</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Indeed, many patients are “in search of lost time,” and smell training can help them to once again experience food and wine in its sensory entirety.</span>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">When considering the topic of my literature review and analysis, I wanted to select work that I could continue research on in graduate school. As I entered academia, my career and life experiences had prepared me well for the unique intersection of veterinary medicine, ecology, and epidemiology. I have been on a pre-veterinary track for many years and have worked professionally in the veterinary field for more than three years. As an Animal Biology major and Global Disease Biology minor, my coursework largely centered around the emerging threat of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. These experiences considered, my primary research interests lie in how we may integrate veterinary medicine into One Health practices to better combat emerging disease threats. In this literature review, I investigate the viability of anthelmintic drugs against arthropod vectors of disease. The use of anthelmintics against arthropods is fairly new, and the pool of current literature is limited but promising. This review was written for those, like myself, who are interested in new approaches to the control of tropical diseases, especially through the lens One Health. I hope to leave readers with a clear picture of what is next for this field, what gaps in the data should be filled, and how we can use information gained in responsible, sustainable ways to combat both emerging and established vector-borne diseases.</span>

<strong>Abstract</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This literature review analyzes the efficacy of currently available anthelmintic drugs against key disease vectoring arthropods.  When comparing effective dosages between different drugs and vector genera, we found that relatively low concentrations are effective against most vectors, but there is evidence to suggest that ivermectin resistance has been established in some species (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Aedes spp</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">). The avermectin drug class also displayed limited efficacy over time, as the drugs degrade in vertebrate species faster than the isoxazoline drug class or fipronil. We determined that the current findings related to this method of vector control are promising. However, further research must be conducted before we implement anthelmintics for mass drug administration as a part of integrated vector management.</span>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Vector-borne diseases threaten the well-being of hundreds of millions of people globally. This is predicted to increase as climate change and human activity facilitate the spread of vector species to previously unoccupied locations. In a press release by the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito &amp; Vector Control District, it was reported that multiple invasive mosquito species, including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Aedes aegypti</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, had been identified in northern California [1]. Recent literature suggests that these habitual expansions may be due, in part, to climate change as these species are able to adapt to broader regions that are of similar climate to their native regions [2]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The continued spread of these species leaves unprepared countries at risk for outbreaks of the diseases vectored by invading species. Moreover, most vector-borne diseases remain uncontrolled in endemic regions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The most direct way to mitigate the threat of globalizing tropical vector-borne diseases is to control the species that are vectoring them. Unfortunately, traditional insecticide-based methods of vector control have become ineffective due to the emergence of insecticide resistance. In 2012, the World Health Organization identified the status of insecticide resistance as “widespread”, as most of the globe reported resistance in at least one major malaria vector [3]. Traditional spray and topical insecticides have been compromised by such resistance. Therefore, it is essential that new methods of vector control,without acquired resistance, be discovered, evaluated, and implemented.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There are many new methods of vector control currently under evaluation. These include genetically modifying vectors to render them sterile, the use of entomopathogenic fungi and viruses, trapping, repellents, and environmental modification [4]. As we continue to evaluate each method for its efficacy, the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) method may be our best option for the elimination of many tropical diseases. Through IVM, we take careful and integrated approaches to vector control via intersectional communication between Public Health officials, Governments, Non-Governmental Organizations, and communities in which we hope to implement our strategies [5]. IVM calls for multiple vector control strategies, and increasing control efficacy via synergy between control efforts. Unfortunately, the primary tool utilized for the control of adult mosquitoes, insecticides, has lost efficacy over time. This is a result of vector insect populations developing resistance to common insecticides, such as pyrethroids and organophosphates, that are used to control adult mosquito populations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is a reservoir of insecticides that have not been utilized against human disease-vectors, which therefore have minimal acquired resistance . </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This class is oral insecticides, or insecticides ingested by vertebrates that act when a vector is exposed via blood meal from a treated animal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">The use of oral insecticides has been standard in veterinary medicine for years, in the form of flea and tick prevention.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Common classes of oral insecticides include avermectins, isoxazolines, and phenylpyrazoles. These compounds have been standard in human and/or veterinary medicine as ectoparasiticides, demonstrating their safety for use in vertebrates. Avermectins, isoxazolines, and phenylpyrazoles have similar modes of action as neurotoxins, with both interrupting the function of GABA-gated chloride ion channels, resulting in insect paralysis [6, 7]. Importantly, there is still diversity within these classes as tools against vector species, as they bind to different sites on the GABA receptors [7, 8]. Investigating the efficacy of these drugs for use as insecticides, against key vectors of diseases such as malaria, zika, west nile virus, leishmaniasis, and African Trypanosomiasis, could be part of the solution to the increasingly urgent problem of insecticide resistance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Research is currently underway, across the globe, to investigate the efficacy of ectoparasiticides against disease vectors. The question still stands, however, if the approach of oral insecticides is any more effective than the traditional insecticides available. To answer this question, we assessed the current literature regarding the testing of ectoparasiticides against disease vectors, and developed a database of studies testing the efficacy of these compounds against vector insects. This analysis aims to determine the relative efficacy of these compounds to determine if these drug classes are worth consideration for use in vector control and management.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Materials and methodology</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To establish a database of the relevant literature, we first mined the scientific literature via the UC Davis Library. Using access granted to undergraduate students, the search terms utilized were input as follows: title/abstract contain “vector” AND “veterinary” AND “control”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">AND “arthropod” in the key word function. Papers were then selected for further analysis. These articles were input into an AI-based literature analysis tool, “Research Rabbit”, to identify additional relevant studies [9]. In addition, studies were selected from the works cited of previously selected works. Papers not testing the efficacy of oral insecticides on adult disease vectors were excluded from the study. Additionally, papers without comparable data (did not supply direct mortality or density data) were also excluded.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Each paper was analyzed to extract relevant data on the efficacy of oral insecticides against disease vectors. The data was collated into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Categories selected for further evaluation included: drug type, the concentrations used, associated concentration resulting in 50% mortality (LC50 values), time to mortality, the reduction of vectors present in field study by visual count (resting density), and drug effects on vector fecundity. However, for the purposes of this study, we focused on LC50 and temporal values.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Other categories were not consistent across publications.</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When creating data visualizations for comparison of different drug types, R’s “ggplot2” package, “dplyr” package and “esquisse” package were used  [10-13]. The categories determined to be best for visual comparison were “Temporal Data” and “LC50” data. After initial visualization was made in R, figures were exported to Adobe Illustrator to edit aesthetically, which was limited to modification of font types and caption content [14]. When creating visualizations for LC50 data, both sandfly and mosquito vectors were compared on the same figure, to compare the efficacy of not only drugs in relation to each other, but also drugs in relation to their efficacy against different disease vectors. When creating the data visualization for this comparison, the drugs “Moxidectin” and “NTBC” were excluded. Moxidectin’s LC50 value was too high to allow for reasonable comparison to other drugs, and NTBC only had a value for tsetse flies (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Glossina spp</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">), which were not represented in any other drug.  Additionally, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Lutzomyia spp </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">displayed LC50 values too high to be effectively compared to other disease vectors. When visualizing temporal data, only </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anopheles spp </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Phebotomus spp </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">had enough supporting information in the literature for effective comparisons. There were 5 studies that supplied data for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anopheles spp </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">temporal data and 2 studies that supplied data for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Phlebotomus spp </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">temporal data. These temporal data were plotted as Day of Feeding against Mortality, faceted by drug type, and grouped by dose. 2 Figures were created, one for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Phlebotomus spp </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and another for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anopheles spp</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Results</strong>

Database Creation

<span style="font-weight: 400">From the initial search in the UC Davis Library system, 15 studies were selected. Then, based on the output from Research Rabbit, an additional 5 studies were selected. Finally, 3 additional papers were identified and integrated into the analysis from the references of the 20 studies. These 23 studies were then evaluated individually from January, 2021 through March, 2021.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">We obtained multiple data categories for comparison between the selected papers. Figure 1 displays the summary of the resulting database. Due to the recent nature of this research, resources from which to draw for our database were limited. Table 1 shows a summary of the data types and the number of  papers each data type was collected from. Within each paper, some investigated efficacy against multiple vector genuses while others investigated only one. Based on the data we were able to collect, we will be moving forward directly comparing temporal data as well as LC50 data.</span>

Comparing Effectiveness of Dosages Between Drugs

<span style="font-weight: 400">We sought to compare the concentrations of drugs required to be effective against the disease vectoring arthropods studied. Figure 2 displays the LC50 values chosen for comparison as a “lollipop” plot. Within the plot, each “dot” represents a single datapoint taken from a study, and 7 studies were compiled to create the plot. In this figure, we are able to compare 2 major drug classes: avermectins and isoxazolines. The isoxazoline drug class had more available data across insect families, and it is clear that the LC50 value is variable between genuses. Sandflies have more resistance to isoxazolines (especially fluralaner) than mosquito species. Amongst the avermectins, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anopheles spp. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Display the most consistent, and relatively low LC50 values. However, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Aedes spp. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">displays higher resistance to ivermectin compared to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anopheles spp</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span>

Comparing Temporal Data

<span style="font-weight: 400">Temporal data involving different insecticides were first to be compared. In temporal data, the “Days Post Feeding (Day of Blood Meal)” represents the number of days after the initial dosing of the vertebrate animals (for example, “Day 3” indicates mosquitos that fed on an animal 3 days after it was given the drug). We were able to create 2 figures for comparing the efficacy of drugs over time at various doses. Doses were represented as variance in color in the figures. Figure 3 displays the efficacy of oral dosing to vertebrates of eprinomectin and ivermectin against </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anopheles spp. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">over time. Both of the drugs in this comparison were of the avermectin class, and neither displayed robust effects on mortality past the 15 day mark after single-dosing of vertebrates with the drugs. Additionally, we observe great variance in the efficacy of ivermectin, even within dosages (that is, mortality varied within dosages between different studies).  Unfortunately, mosquito genuses outside of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anopheles </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">did not provide enough data to compare efficacy over time.</span>

<img class="wp-image-4030 size-full aligncenter" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/10/unnamed-6.jpeg" alt="" width="512" height="385" />

<span style="font-weight: 400">Created in a similar fashion, Figure 4 displays the efficacy of oral dosing of vertebrates with fipronil and fluralaner. Here, two separate drug classes were tested for efficacy. While fluralaner (a member of the isoxazoline drug class) acts in a similar mode of action to avermectins, it maintains efficacy over time in Sandflies. Because mosquitos displayed more sensitivity to isoxazolines than sandflies, (Figure 2) one may predict similar, if not more deadly, effects when isoxazolines are tested over time for mosquitos. The drug fipronil displays varying efficacy between doses. Unfortunately, the study involving fipronil did not collect data past 21 days of administration, but it is possible some of the dosages would have remained effective from visual interpretation of the figure. Due to the limited amount of studies investigating the efficacy of oral insecticides, we were not able to compare the efficacy of all drugs over time, as other studies used different methods of efficacy measurements.</span>

<strong>Discussion</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Based on the findings of our review of currently available literature, oral insecticides certainly show promise as a method of Disease Vector management. As displayed in Figure 2, we are able to determine effective dosages for each drug as a concentration in blood. However, there was significant variance in the data between taxa and between drugs. The highest resistance was observed in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Aedes spp</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. against ivermectin, which could be evidence of acquired resistance due to the common use of ivermectin in humans as an anthelmintic [15]. Another significant variance observed was the relative resistance of sandflies to isoxazolines, requiring approximately twice the concentration or more compared to mosquito species [16]. It is unclear if this effect carries over to other drugs, as there is no available data.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There were also studies analyzed that were not included in the visual data analyses performed. These included studies that investigated the efficacy of isoxazolines against the kissing bug, of nitisinone against the tsetse fly, a field study, and data from otherwise integrated studies measuring the effect of the drugs on fecundity of arthropods [16-22]. The investigation by Loza et al. regarding the efficacy of isoxazolines against the kissing bug showed similar temporal data results to papers investigating isoxazolines against Sandflies, which was visualized in Figure 4 [17]. The isoxazoline drug class, then, has been shown to be effective against 3 major disease vector families. Another drug class also shows promise. A study by Sterkel et al proposes the use of nitisinone (traditionally used in the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, a genetic disorder) as an insecticide dispensed to vertebrates, and investigates its efficacy against the African Trypanosomiasis vector, the tsetse fly. This study highlights the importance of looking for alternative methods to vector control, and manipulates a characteristic of a drug originally developed to aid in human disease against disease vectors. The 2021 study found that concentrations above 0.5 micrograms per milliliter in blood impacted survival of feeding tsetse flies significantly, while also studying pharmacokinetics when ingested by mouse models [18]. Pharmacokinetic data supplied by the mouse models in this study may assist in any later calculations for human dosage.  No evidence is available on the effectiveness of nitisinone on other disease vectors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Three studies supplied data involving sublethal effects on adult arthropods, including fecundity. These studies found that there were significant effects on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anopheles spp</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. fecundity, regardless of vertebrate being dosed and observed across multiple doses [20-22]. There is no currently available data involving the effects of isoxazolines or phenylpyrazoles. Should they be provided, however, they show additional promise as vector management tools. When an insecticide is able to exhibit both lethal and sublethal effects, particularly regarding fecundity, insects that survive the initial exposure produce less offspring than their unexposed peers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In order for these methods to be effective in Disease Vector management, there would need to be a considerable number of individuals in the population participating to make a significant impact on the burden of vector borne diseases [16, 19]. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) is expensive, and cost is a limiting factor in many of the areas we hope to lower disease burden in. Due to this, and issues related to the accessibility of MDA, it is important that drugs remain effective for an extended period of time. Fortunately, we found this to be the case. As evident in Figure 4, both isoxazoline drugs display extended efficacy on mortality of sandflies over 40 days after initial vertebrate dosage. Additionally, it may be that fipronil displays a similar effect in higher tested dosages, following the trajectory of the available data. Unfortunately, there is limited literature on this subject, so we are unable to say with absolute certainty that these effects would carry over to mosquito species. Figure 3 suggests that the avermectin drug class does not have the same long-term effect on arthropod mortality. For both ivermectin and eprinomectin, mortality dropped below 50% overall after just 14 days from initial dosage. For this reason, the isoxazoline and phenylpyrazole drug classes may be more effective for MDA, although their testing for safety in humans is less extensive (than ivermectin).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, there is the question of if MDA should be dispensed to humans or livestock. The field study by Poche et al. applied previous findings to the field, dosing cattle in several tribes in Africa and visually measuring the effects on the density of mosquitos found in nearby homes. They observed that the dosage of livestock with fipronil reduced the “resting density” of mosquito species known to feed on both cattle and humans, but did not significantly affect the resting density of particularly anthropophilic species [19]. This study highlights the importance of catering an MDA to the specific species you want to impact by ensuring dosage to vertebrates that it is likely to take a blood meal from.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When considering a drug for use in MDA, the safety of the drug must be copiously studied, and current findings are promising. At the dosages used in the study that were effective against adult arthropods, vertebrates suffered no severe adverse effects attributed to the dosages in all of the studies analyzed. This strongly suggests that these drugs are safe for use in IVM. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, when considering MDA, taking a “One Health” approach will also be key to success.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Too often, non-Governmental Organizations have gone into regions with targeted endemic diseases, and neglected to listen to native perspectives on previously used methods of disease control and basic needs. While investigating the efficacy of these drugs is important to protecting communities against vector-borne disease, giving aid to impoverished communities must first address the baseline health of individuals at risk. Only then can we hope to earn the trust of native populations, and continue to help them in sustainable ways. Continuing to thoroughly investigate the efficacy and safety of this sector of vector management before beginning any large implementation will also be essential.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, it can be inferred from the amount of studies performed that there needs to be an enormous amount of research performed before we integrate oral insecticides, especially in humans, into IVM. What we do know, though, gives promise in the face of the insurmountable resistance to traditional pesticides.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>By Laura Gardner, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology ‘22</b>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">With so much information in the media and online about COVID-19, I find many people get lost in, and fall victim to, false information. I want to reassure the Davis community with factual information on how Davis is fighting COVID-19. With UC Davis’ strong scientific community, I was curious what tools were being used to mitigate the spread of  COVID-19. In January 2021, I attended a virtual COVID-19 symposium called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Questions about Tests and Vaccines </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">led by Walter S Leal, distinguished Professor of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at University of California-Davis (UC Davis). In this symposium, I learned about Dr. Heather Bischel’s work testing the sewer system. This testing is another source for early detection of COVID-19. In combination with biweekly testing, I have no doubt that UC Davis is being proactive in their precautions throughout the pandemic, which made me personally feel more safe. I hope that this article will shed light on wastewater epidemiology as a tool that can be implemented elsewhere.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Heather Bischel is an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Davis. Bischel has teamed up with the city of Davis through the Healthy Davis Together initiative to use wastewater epidemiology, a technique for measuring chemicals in wastewater, to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 [6]. When a person defecates, their waste travels through the pipes and is collected in the sewer system. In both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, their feces will carry the genetic material that indicates the virus is present. This is because SARS-CoV-2 uses </span><span style="font-weight: 400">angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, also known as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ACE2, as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract [1]. This serves as an early indicator of a possible COVID-19 outbreak and leads to quick treatment and isolation, which are important to stop the spread of the disease.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Samples are taken periodically from manholes around campus using a mechanical device called an autosampler. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">These autosamplers are lowered into manholes to collect wastewater flow samples every 15 minutes for 24 hours. Next, the samples are taken to the lab where they are able to extract genetic material and use Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to detect the virus. Chemical markers that attach to the specific genetic sequence of the virus are added to the sample, which reacts to the COVID-19 virus by fluorescing visible light. This light is the signal that indicates positive test results. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The samples are collected throughout campus, with a focus on residential halls. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">An infected person will excrete the virus through their bowel movements before showing symptoms. The samples are so sensitive that if even just one person among thousands is sick, they are still able to detect the presence of COVID-19 genetic material</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.  When a PCR test provides a positive signal, the program works closely with the UC Davis campus to identify if there has been someone who has reported a positive COVID-19 test. If no one from the building is known to be positive, they send out a communication email asking all the students of the building to get tested as soon as possible. That way the infected person can be identified and isolated as soon as possible, eliminating exposure from unidentified cases [4].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In collaboration with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">UC Davis campus as well as the city of Davis, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Bische</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> has implemented wastewater epidemiology throughout the community. Since summer 2020, Dr. Bische’s team of researchers have collected data which is available</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> online through the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healthy Davis Together initiative</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [4].  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to being an early indicator, this data has also been used to determine trends, which can indicate if existing efforts to combat the virus are working or not [2]. Existing efforts include vaccinations, mask wearing, washing hands, maintaining proper social distancing, and staying home when one feels ill. UC Davis has implemented protocols including biweekly testing and a daily symptom survey that must be completed and approved in order to be on campus.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Wastewater epidemiology has been implemented all over the world, at more than 233 Universities and in 50 different countries, according to monitoring efforts from UC Merced</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [3]. This testing has been used in the past to detect polio, but has never before been implemented on the scale of a global pandemic. Lacking infrastructure, such as ineffective waste disposal systems, open defecation, and poor sanitation pose global challenges, especially in developing countries [2].  Without tools for early detection, these communities are in danger of having an exponential rise in cases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Our work enables data-driven decision-making using wastewater infrastructure at city, neighborhood, and building scales,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Dr. Bische stated proudly in her latest blog post [2]. These decisions are crucial in confining COVID-19 as we continue to push through the pandemic.</span>

<b>Author’s Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Ever since I took BIS2C at UC Davis, I was intrigued as to how our gut microbiome plays such a huge role in our homeostasis beyond just digestion – in particular, the correlation between decreased microbiome diversity and allergies we learned about in the lab fascinated me. I recently stumbled upon the term “gut-brain axis” and was in awe as to how this connection between our gut microbes and our brain even exists, and learned that gut microbiome diversity is implicated in a plethora of mental disorders, from depression and anxiety, to autism. I decided to write this review to share my learning of how the gut microbiome can change the brain and potentially contribute to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), because I feel as if this is not a widely known correlation – even as a physiology major, I never learned about the gut-brain axis in my courses. Moreover, the cause of autism is still widely undefined and the gut microbiome may provide a possible explanation for ASD onset in some individuals. I believe a wide range of students will find this upcoming research interesting, but my intended audience is those who research autism or work with autistic individuals, as it may provide an explanation for ASD and seems to be a likely target for clinical therapy for autism in the future. Above all, I want my readers to take away a better understanding of the gut-brain axis and how its imbalance can be implicated in brain disorders like autism.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Introduction</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including difficulty with communication, social interaction, and restricted and repetitive behaviors that present differently in every individual [1]. Although 1 in 54 children are estimated to be on the autism spectrum according to the CDC [2], the etiology of the condition remains poorly understood. Factors including genetics and certain maternal environmental conditions have been identified as potential contributors to the development of ASD in children, but the exact cause is still unknown [3].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> A common comorbidity experienced by ASD individuals is gastrointestinal (GI) problems—including abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea —as such, autism research is pivoting towards studying the gut microbiome. [1]. Specifically, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">link between the composition of the gut microbiome and brain development has been established in recent years — termed the “gut-brain axis”— and it appears to be the future of autism research.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> This literature review aims to identify the role of the human gut microbiome on the development of autism-like behavior and investigate whether therapies targeting the gut microbiome can be effective clinical treatments for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The article will first define the differences observed in gut microbiota between autistic and neurotypical individuals, then discuss how these differences in composition may affect brain development, and finally propose clinical implications targeting gut microbiota that appear promising in the treatment and diagnosis of ASD-related behaviors.  </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Gut Microbiome of ASD Patients Differ From Neurotypical Individuals</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The gut microbiomes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients have defining characteristics that significantly differ from those of neurotypical individuals. The human gut microbiome consists of a diverse array of predominantly bacteria but also archaea, eukarya and viruses that possess unique microbial enzymes to aid humans in digestion and also a variety of other physiological functions [4]. The three phyla </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Firmicutes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bacteroidetes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Actinobacteria</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> [5] encompass the majority of bacteria present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that aid in these functions. However, an imbalance between the ratio of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Firmicutes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bacteroidetes </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">bacteria is found in autistic individuals when compared to the microbiome composition of neurotypical subjects; in particular, patients with autism tend to have an overexpression of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Firmicutes </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">in their gut [6,7]. Other studies have demonstrated an excess of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clostridium</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> genus in the ASD microbiome [8]</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">as well as an overexpression of the genus </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bacilli</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the mouths and gut of autistic individuals [7]. While the cause behind this imbalance is unknown, these findings signify a consistent pattern of microbial imbalance in the autistic gut microbiome. In fact, a Random Forest prediction model, a computer algorithm that can classify large sets of data into subgroup “trees” based on data similarity, was able to distinguish ASD children from neurotypical children with a high degree of certainty from just microbiome sequencing data [7], demonstrating the predictability of this dysbiosis by artificial intelligence. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4048 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-5.png" alt="" width="512" height="341" />

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Figure 1: This illustrates the difference between species richness and species abundance. Species richness, a measure of alpha diversity, informs on how many species are present in a sample. Species abundance describes how many organisms of each species are present. </span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Along with microbial imbalance—termed dysbiosis—autistic children also tend to have a decreased alpha diversity [7,9], which measures mean species diversity, as well as significantly lower gut species richness [7], the number of species present, when compared to age and sex-matched neurotypical children. One study found that for neurotypical children, alpha diversity, species richness, and species abundance all increased between the age groups 2-3 to 7-11; yet for ASD children, no significant development in microbial composition was observed with increase in age [7]. Since autism has been found to slow brain development as children age [9], this </span><span style="font-weight: 400">reduced development of the microbiome mirrors the altered brain development characteristic of ASD pathophysiology, proposing an association between decreased microbial diversity and autism.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Due to this observed correlation between dysbiosis and ASD, whether gut dysbiosis is truly causal for autism has come into question. In a preliminary study, Sharon et al transplanted fecal microbiota from autistic donors into otherwise germ-free mice (mice with a sterile gut) and observed their offspring’s behavior compared to offspring of mice inoculated with microbiota from neurotypical donors. Notably, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">mice with the ASD microbiome</span><span style="font-weight: 400">— characterized by decreased alpha and beta diversity and decreased </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bacteroidetes </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">— </span><span style="font-weight: 400">exhibited behaviors paralleling those of autism, including repetitive behaviors, decreased locomotion and decreased communication </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[9]. This demonstrated that gut dysbiosis can in fact induce the behavioral deficits observed in ASD. This is significant evidence toward the theory that gut dysbiosis indeed contributes to ASD – an important finding that changes our current understanding of the etiology of autism.</span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4049 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-6.png" alt="" width="386" height="512" />

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Figure 2: Above is a visual depiction of the study conducted by Sharon &amp; colleagues, where germ-free mice were inoculated with gut microbiota from either autistic or neurotypical donors. Offspring of the mice transplanted with ASD microbiome were shown to exhibit autism-like behavior.</span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">How Microbiota Imbalance Affects Brain Function: The Gut-Brain Axis</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Since the microbial dysbiosis found to be common in ASD patients contributes to behavioral deficits, several different mechanisms have been proposed for how the altered microbial environment in ASD patients can affect brain development.</span>

<b>Intestinal permeability</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The microbes that line the GI tract provide structural and protective benefits to our intestines, including stimulating epithelial cell regeneration and mucus production by the intestinal walls. When microbial diversity is decreased, the integrity of the intestinal walls may be compromised which can lead to increased intestinal permeability [8]. This may allow for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pro-inflammatory endotoxin that is found in gram-negative bacterial cell walls, to escape out of the GI tract and into the bloodstream. Serum levels of LPS are in fact found to be significantly higher in autistic individuals [12].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">LPS causes inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and is found to impair cognition and motivation in the mouse model. Specifically, implications for impaired continuous attention and curiosity behaviors, along with modulation of other areas of the brain like the central amygdala have been associated with circulating LPS [11]. Therefore, altered intestinal permeability is a possible mechanism by which dysbiosis modulates brain inflammation, a hallmark of autism that is thought to contribute to its behavioral symptoms.  </span>

<b>Microbial metabolites</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">As gut microbes carry out cellular functions inside their human hosts, they also secrete compounds as by-products of metabolism. Two such metabolites are 5AV and taurine, which are secreted by gut </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bacteroides</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">xylanisolvens </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and other bacteria. 5AV and taurine levels are found to be significantly lower in autistic individuals [13,14] as well as mice transplanted with ASD microbiome [9], likely due to dysbiosis. Both 5AV and taurine are gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) receptor antagonists, meaning that lower levels of these circulating microbial metabolites can alter the inhibitory signaling of GABA in the nervous system [9]. GABA regulates various developmental processes in the brain, including cell differentiation and synapse formation, so dysfunction in GABA signalling is thought to account for ASD symptoms [15]. Oral administration of taurine and 5AV in a mouse model of ASD with an altered microbiome is shown to reduce repetitive behavior and increase social behavior, suggesting that the deficiencies in these metabolites may contribute to the behavioral manifestations of autism [9]. There are other microbial metabolite imbalances in autistic children, including dopaquinone, pyroglutamic acid, and other molecules involved in neurotransmitter production. These imbalances affect brain signaling pathways, and therefore could contribute to the behavioral deficits often present in autistic children. Further, these metabolite imbalances correlate with the levels of certain gut bacteria, further emphasizing the link between the gut microbiome and neurological disorders such as ASD. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">

</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clinical Implications for ASD Diagnosis and Treatment</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Today, symptoms of autism are alleviated with behavioral and educational therapy, and no pharmaceutical treatment exists [1]. With the knowledge that the gut microbiome significantly differs in autistic individuals and that these differences are shown to interfere with the nervous system, preliminary research has been done on potential diagnostics and pharmaceutical therapeutics for ASD that target dysbiosis in the gut. </span>

<b>Diagnostics</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To date, there is no objective laboratory test to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children, so autism is primarily diagnosed through a doctor’s evaluation of a patient’s behavior and developmental history. However, the ability of a computer program to distinguish the autistic microbiome from the neurotypical microbiome holds potential for use in ASD clinical risk assessments through analysis of the gut microbiome, and subsequent gut health monitoring interventions for those detected to have ASD-like dysbiosis [7]. The strong association between the presence of certain bacterial species in the mouth and bacteria in the gut — in particular the significant positive correlation between saliva </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Chloroflexi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and gut </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Firmicutes—</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">may suggest possible oral biomarkers to predict gut microbial diversity [6]. In addition, the overexpression of certain bacteria in the gut have been identified to be associated with certain symptoms like allergies and abdominal pain, opening an avenue to improve the diagnosis process of ASD through the inclusion of a more objective, laboratory-based test [6].</span>

<b>Microbiota Transfer Therapy</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) is an emerging therapy that aims to replace the gut microbiome of ASD individuals with a more diverse, healthy gut microbiome. One form of MTT consists of a two-week oral vancomycin antibiotic treatment, followed by a bowel cleanse using MoviPrep, and then finally an extended fecal microbiota transplant for 7-8 weeks, administered orally or rectally. In a clinical trial involving autistic children, MTT significantly increased gut bacterial diversity 8 weeks after treatment stopped, along with improving GI symptoms (including abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhea and constipation) measured through the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). Significant improvements in behavioral ASD symptoms were found post treatment as well, measured through increases from baseline scores on a variety of exams that evaluate social skills, irritability, hyperactivity and communication, among other behaviors [16]. These improvements in microbial diversity and subsequently ASD-related behavior were all found to have been maintained at follow-up study two years later, indicating that</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> MTT is a safe and efficient therapy that has potential to improve ASD outcomes in the long-term [</span><span style="font-weight: 400">17]. However, further studies on the efficacy of MTT are necessary to establish this connection, as the above study sample was small and most symptoms and improvements were self-reported. </span>

<b>Probiotics</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Because imbalances in the microbiome are correlated with autism, direct administration of bacterial cultures using probiotics seems to be a potential approach to treat ASD behavioral symptoms. Probiotic treatment that included a combination of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bifildobacterium </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">was found to be effective in improving core behavioral symptoms of ASD, specifically adaptive functioning, developmental pathways, and multisensory processing in autistic children with GI symptoms [18]. Probiotics have been shown to improve symptoms of other mood disorders like anxiety and depression, both of which are associated with dysbiosis and the gut-brain axis [8],</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">warranting further research on probiotics as a treatment for ASD. Therapies that target microbial metabolite imbalances in ASD individuals, like 5AV and taurine, may also open an avenue for future autism research [9].</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Conclusion</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The gut microbiome contributes to the maintenance of much of human physiology, with involvement in not only the digestive system but also the immune system and the brain. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been found to be prevalent in children and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and this dysbiosis may be linked to the behavioral symptoms observed. Treatments that target the gut microbiome, therefore, serve to be useful in improving behavioral deficits associated with ASD and should be a consideration for future research with more rigorous experimental design.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Anisha Narsam, Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior ‘23 </strong>

<strong>Author’s Note: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope to raise awareness about treatments for eye strain from screen exposure because of the current pandemic and the increase in online interactions. This article is meant for students and individuals who work on devices with screens, such as computers or tablets, and want to treat their eye strain. I chose this topic because I have noticed an increase in my eye strain since the pandemic began and I wanted to research how to alleviate this condition for myself and for my peers. Through this article, I hope readers can understand the effectiveness of a range of treatments for eye strain from screen exposure with my analysis of seven peer-reviewed journal articles.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Abstract</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Excessive screen time, due to remote learning, is dramatically increasing the incidence of eye strain. Since this condition can elevate tiredness and reduce an individual’s ability to concentrate, promising treatments must be considered to avoid further ocular harm. Previous research on eye strain shows that when people spend a lot of time on their computer, they can benefit from taking frequent breaks away from their screens. However, with increased reliance on technology for everyday tasks, these techniques are not enough. As a result, treatments must be developed and implemented to counter the degenerative effects of long-term eye strain, which may eventually lead to headaches and farsightedness. This paper analyzes seven peer-reviewed journal articles centered around the effectiveness of each treatment on eye strain. Supplemental medications and ergonomic techniques show promising results for combatting dry eye and ocular pain, specific symptoms of eye strain. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of blue light glasses demonstrate conflicting results. Further research and implementation of these methods can decrease eye strain symptoms while improving concentration.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Introduction</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Eye strain is one of the most common ocular conditions faced by adults and students around the world [1]. As of 2017, around 64 percent to 90 percent of computer users reported eye strain symptoms [2]. Physiologically, these symptoms result from repetitive rapid eye movements between the keyboard, screen, and other documents [2]. With more interactions taking place virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing this condition is crucial for decreasing headaches and improving focus when completing tasks on screens. Many studies have only focused on treatment through minor modifications in a person’s behavioral tendencies, such as by following the 20/20/20 rule. This rule asks individuals to look 20 feet away from their screens for 20 seconds every 20 minutes [3]. Since taking frequent screen breaks may not be helpful for severe eye strain, the purpose of this literature review is to evaluate the effectiveness of medications [1, 4, 5], blue light-blocking glasses [6,7], and ergonomic techniques [2, 3] in combating this condition.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">By evaluating these treatments, we can determine reliable methods for alleviating eye fatigue. </span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Medication</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In terms of medication, omega-3 fatty acids (O3Fas) can reduce eye strain [1]. Specifically, O3Fas treat patients with dry eye, which is a symptom of eye strain. When people stare at one location for extended periods of time, they often do not blink as much, which results in dry eye because of decreased eye lubrication [2]. On a cellular level, O3Fas has been shown to increase the density of goblet cells, which lubricate the eye. The patients chosen for the study used a computer for more than three hours each day [1]. While 120 patients received the O3Fas treatment, the remaining 236 patients received an olive oil placebo daily and their symptoms were evaluated. Each week, patients assigned a score between zero and three for symptoms such as blurry vision, dry eyes, and red eyes [1]. At the baseline, 60 percent of patients had moderate dry eye symptoms in both the O3Fas and the placebo groups [1]. By the end of the experiment, 70 percent of the O3Fas group and 15 percent of the placebo group were symptom free. In addition, Schirmer’s test was performed, which involves gently placing a filter paper onto the participants’ eyes and analyzing the cells found on this paper for tear production [1, 4]. A statistically significant improvement in dry eye symptoms was found in the O3Fas group compared to the placebo group, demonstrating the effectiveness of O3Fas in combatting dry eye</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> resulting from computer vision syndrome</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [1]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">They can also improve epithelial cellular morphology in the eyes while decreasing tear evaporation rates, which ends up reducing eye strain symptoms.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">While this study analyzed the effects of O3Fas, it did not test for how the dosage of O3Fas affects an individual’s symptoms.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Besides O3Fas, researchers examined how the dosage of a particular botanical formula can decrease eye strain, while using a machine learning-based model to predict an accurate dosage for each patient</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [4].</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Botanical formulas are natural, plant-based ingredients and oils that are combined in order to treat or supplement a condition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">This specific botanical formula is made of carotenoids, naturally derived pigments in plants that support eye health, as well as blackcurrant, chrysanthemum, zeaxanthin, and goji berry. These formulas are antioxidants and are known for their ability to absorb the blue light that typically radiates from visual display units. Researchers split the participants, who are each exposed to screens daily, into four groups. The three experimental groups ingested six, ten, or fourteen milligrams of the chewable tablet, while the fourth group received a placebo [4]. Similar to the O3Fas study, this study also asked patients to take these tablets once daily for 90 days, while self-reporting how often they felt symptoms such as eye soreness and dry eye [1, 4]. In addition, both studies used Schirmer’s test to evaluate dry eye symptoms, which found that both the 10-milligram and 14-milligram groups had increased tear production [1, 4].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Researchers input the symptoms and dosages of 56 of the participants into their machine learning model, XGBoost. The study found that the optimal dosage is 14 milligrams for 39 individuals, 10 milligrams for 17 individuals, and zero milligrams for two participants [4]. Researchers determined that the botanical formula significantly improves eye strain, while outlining the potential for machine learning to determine optimal dosages [4]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Bilberry</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> extract (BE), another naturally-derived medication, has proven to be quite effective in reducing eye strain caused by acute video display terminal (VDT) loads, or devices with a display screen [5]. BE is loaded with anthocyanins, which are known for their ability to decrease further visual disturbance  and eye strain. The participants use VDTs daily and have eye strain symptoms. Over an eight-week period, the experimental group ingested 480 milligrams of BE per day, in contrast to the placebo group [5]. The researchers evaluated their symptoms using the Critical Flicker Fusion device (CFF), which analyzes the frequency of a human eye identifying a blinking light as continuous [5, 6]. Lower CFF values correlate to less eye strain symptoms. This contrasts to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">O3Fas and botanical formula studies that analyze the dryness of a patient’s eyes through </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Schirmer’s test [1, 4, 5]. Moreover, all three studies focused on patients with existing eye strain [1, 4, 5]. A self-reported questionnaire asked participants to rate the intensity of their symptoms on a scale from one to ten every week. Based on the CFF tests, researchers found a statistically significant lower CFF value, or less eye strain, for the BE group compared to the baseline [5].This CFF reduction was not observed in the placebo group. Participants in the BE group felt less ocular pain compared to the control group.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The researchers argued that BE supplements can reduce eye strain caused by VDT loads, while further research can eventually analyze how BE works [5]. </span>

<strong>Blue Light-Blocking Glasses</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Medications are important treatments to consider, but there are many behavioral changes that may decrease eye strain symptoms too. One possible behavioral change is wearing blue light-blocking glasses in treating eye strain. Blue light is short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation, which ranges from around 400 to 500 nm in length, and carries one of the highest amounts of energy [7]. There have been many hypotheses previously considered, which shows how blue light could potentially cause retinal damage, especially towards the aging eye. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, from studies in animals, increasing amounts of blue light exposure can increase the amount of cell apoptosis in the eyes [7]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. It is important to note that blue light is emitted by the sun onto Earth’s surface, but it is the excessive exposure to blue light from screens that can have negative effects [6]. Based on these previous experiments, researchers aim to understand whether or not blocking blue light is effective in preventing eye strain and retinal damage by testing the effects of the blue light-blocking glasses. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Lin et al. assigned 36 participants into groups with the clear lens placebo, low-blocking glasses, and high-blocking glasses [6]. Afterwards, participants performed a 2-hour task on identical computers in similar controlled environments. Researchers used the CFF device and a participant-reported survey to evaluate symptoms of eye strain and fatigue [6]. The CFF depicted significantly less eye fatigue in the high-blocking group compared to the low-blocking and placebo groups. Participant surveys suggested that the high-blocking group reported feeling less pain and itchiness in their eyes after the computer task. However, there was no statistically significant correlation between blue light-blocking glasses and eye strain specifically, based on the participants’ self-reported scores for the intensity of their eye strain symptoms [6]. Therefore, researchers determined that blocking large amounts of blue light may reduce eye strain from screen exposure, but more research needs to be done to determine if this effect is substantial. Awareness of these results can encourage the usage of blue light-blocking glasses to decrease eye pain and itchiness, while further studies can also evaluate its effects on eye strain and the specific amount of blue light blocked by different glasses [6]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Similar to Lin et al., Leung et al. also presented inconclusive results. Leung et al. compared the symptoms of patients wearing blue light-filtering glasses, brown tinted glasses, and a placebo, and found that while blue light filters decrease eye sensitivity, most participants could not detect these changes [7]. A group of 80 computer users wore the lenses for two hours each day for around one month. The participants switched between the lenses during this time period. Researchers performed contrast sensitivity tests on the participants to see how accurately they can read a chart. Researchers use these tests to evaluate how accurately participants could read a chart in which the contrast of each black letter fades into the white background in small increments [7].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">This test found no significantly different contrast sensitivity results between the experimental and placebo groups. Based on weekly questionnaires, more than 45 percent of patients reported no changes in their eyesight or eye strain symptoms, while the majority reported no differences between the blue light-blocking glasses and the control lenses [7]. Researchers concluded that analyzing the effects of blue light-blocking glasses is difficult. Spectral transmittance, which evaluates the amount of blue light blocked, showed that the glasses reflected around 10.3 percent to 23.6 percent of harmful blue light [7]. Based on this discovery, researchers found that it is still important to wear these glasses to block the harmful radiation present between 400 and 500 nm in the blue light range, even when participants found no noticeable benefits. The differences between these two studies suggest how these various approaches could lead to similarly inconclusive results.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To compare the two studies, Lin et al.’s research included only 36 participants in a two-hour-long study in identical environments, while Leung et al.’s study had 80 participants and occurred over two months with no supervision [6, 7]. While Leung et al.’s  study could analyze long-term effects of the glasses, Lin et al.’s experiment could only analyze the short-term benefits but in a controlled environment. Additionally, Lin et al.’s study only allowed each participant to try on one of the glasses, while Leung et al.’s experiment allowed participants to wear each one of the glasses [6, 7]. As a result, Leung et al.’s  study eliminated differences in personal opinion between participants by only evaluating how one group responded to each of the variables. The outcomes of both studies showed how blue light-blocking glasses could relieve eye strain, although more research still needs to be done on this topic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Ergonomics</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While there is conflicting evidence for wearing blue light glasses as a behavioral modification technique, the ergonomic approach shows more promise. To determine the benefits of ergonomics on computer vision syndrome (CVS), Mowatt et al. evaluated the prevalence of eye strain in students at The University of the West Indies (UWI) [2]. Specifically, researchers analyzed how the angle of a computer screen affects eye strain. In this cross-sectional study, 409 students answered a questionnaire related to how often they use a computer, the severity of their eye strain symptoms, and the angle of their screens in relation to their eyes [2]. The results depicted how severe eye strain occurred in 63 percent of the students who look down at their device compared to 21 percent of the participants who keep their device at eye-level [2]. However, the data did not present a relationship between the prevalence of eye strain and the length of time spent on a computer. These results support the use of ergonomic practices, such as keeping a screen at eye-level, to reduce eye fatigue. Increased awareness of such behavioral modification techniques, especially by universities, can prevent eye strain in students [2]. A similar study also uses a survey to analyze practices among individuals who work on computers daily.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Using surveys, researchers analyzed how ergonomics and symptoms of eye strain can be correlated. Office workers answered a questionnaire about eye strain symptoms and workplace conditions [3]. Researchers found that a higher angle of gaze towards a monitor is associated with more CVS prevalence [3]. In addition, looking upwards at a screen should be avoided as it results in muscular strain on the trapezius and neck muscles. This contrasts with the study at UWI, which determined that patients who looked down at their screens, at relatively large angles from eye level, tended to have more strained eyes [2,3]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on the results of both studies, placing the screen between eye level and at a small angle of 10 degrees downwards may be the best resolution. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, using a monitor with a filter and adjusting the brightness of an individual’s screen to match that of the environment is correlated with less CVS [3]. Although these results may seem to be solutions for CVS, they are based on surveys rather than controlled studies [2, 3]. Therefore, there is no definite causation between a certain ergonomic practice and eye strain.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">When looking at all the possible treatments for eye strain from screen exposure, there are many different medications [1, 4, 5], types of blue light-blocking glasses [6, 7], and ergonomic techniques [2, 3] that can reduce symptoms. O3Fas and the presented botanical formula both show reduction in eye strain symptoms when evaluated with Schirmer’s test for dry eye [1, 4]. The BE study also showed promising results in reducing symptoms of eye fatigue through the CFF test, which focuses more on the temporal processing ability of the eyes [5]. Though blue light-blocking glasses show positive results on the CFF tests and through measured spectral transmittance data, there are mixed results as to whether or not participants detect any changes in eye strain when wearing these glasses [6, 7]. Further testing can be done to evaluate the effects of blue light glasses, such as by examining a larger population or through a longitudinal study. Ergonomic techniques are correlated with less eye strain, according to recent surveys [2, 3]. Clinical trials in controlled environments can show more direct implications of ergonomic practices on eye strain from screen exposure. These treatments combined have the potential to reduce eye strain symptoms, leading to fewer headaches and improved concentration.</span>

A representation of monoclonal antibodies binding to antigens on a cell surface. Monoclonal antibodies target a specific antigen and are derived from the same cell and grown in a clonal population (mono-clonal). Whereas, polyclonal antibodies are derived from a mix of antibodies (poly-clonal) and, therefore, can bind to multiple antigens. In this image the antigens are depicted as gold rings and the binding site of the monoclonal antibodies are gold clefts in the Y-shaped antibody structure.

A representation of monoclonal antibodies binding to antigens on a cell surface. Monoclonal antibodies target a specific antigen and are derived from the same cell and grown in a clonal population (mono-clonal). Whereas, polyclonal antibodies are derived from a mix of antibodies (poly-clonal) and, therefore, can bind to multiple antigens. In this image the antigens are depicted as gold rings and the binding site of the monoclonal antibodies are gold clefts in the Y-shaped antibody structure.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By Clara Brewer, Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior ’22</strong>

<strong>Author's Note: </strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In 2015, I was diagnosed with a rare pain disorder- Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Not only does this disorder cause unimaginable pain, it is also virtually invisible to others, creating a discrepancy between the outside world’s perception of CRPS and the actual struggle that CRPS patients deal with, both physically and emotionally. Current trends for CRPS treatment are focused on the physical aspects of the disorder- increasing mobility and use of the affected limb. Oftentimes, this approach fails to treat the simultaneous psychological changes that can increase a patient's risk for developing a concurrent mental health disorder. Even though I had access to a top CRPS treatment facility, I still experienced depression and anxiety which made my recovery from CRPS much harder. While writing a different paper focused on educating newly diagnosed individuals on the causes, symptoms, and available treatment options for CRPS, I realized that most of my findings addressed the physical symptoms and not the psychological changes. This discrepancy between both my own experiences and the experiences of many others who were diagnosed with CRPS and the treatment options available inspired me to try to understand this connection between CRPS and the increased diagnosis of comorbid mental health disorders.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While many students who read this paper may not go on to change the treatment for one rare disorder- it is important for anyone who wants to go into the medical field to begin reshaping their approach to medicine by reading articles like mine. I hope to shed light on the importance of reevaluating current treatment protocols for a wide range of disorders to include more mental health support for patients- a topic directed for students hoping to pursue a career in the medical field. By viewing medical diagnosis- in this case CRPS- as an interconnection between mind and body, future medical professionals will be able to holistically address disorder, instead of treating only the more obvious physical symptoms.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400">Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a neuroinflammatory disease, ranks number one on the McGill Pain Scale, topping fibromyalgia, cancer, and amputation without anesthetics. The development of CRPS typically occurs after trauma to the arm or leg (e.g., breaking of a bone, dislocation of a joint, surgical trauma to a limb) that results in a disproportionately high sensation of pain. This painful response is chronic and characterized by constant pain with additional flare-ups that last different amounts of time from person to person. As a result, those with CRPS will often experience perpetual pain that can be made even worse with stress. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">After the initial injury and subsequent chronic pain, a CRPS diagnosis follows the Budapest Diagnostic Criteria, where patients must report symptoms in three of four categories and must present symptoms in two of four categories at the time of evaluation. The categories are as follows: sensory, vasomotor (relating to blood vessels), sudomotor (relating to sweat glands), and motor/tropic (relating to muscles and bones). Symptoms include swelling of the limbs, skin discoloration, abnormal sweat response, and painful responses to non-painful or slightly painful stimuli, among others [1].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">CRPS affects 200,000 people in the United States each year. Among those affected, half are also diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder [2]. More specifically, CRPS patients have a much higher prevalence of depression than the general population, with 15.6 percent of CRPS patients diagnosed with depression compared to 3.4 percent of people diagnosed with depression worldwide [2]. Since the pain in CRPS is so intense and the length of a painful flare-up varies from person to person, many patients come to develop a fear of the pain itself, altering their fear-brain circuits and creating a negative relationship between pain and their psychological state [3]. Mood disorders like depression and anxiety also have similar pathophysiology as CRPS, so the onset of CRPS can instigate the development of a comorbid mood disorder without an external trigger like grief, loss, or substance abuse. Within the physiology of CRPS, cytokine and astrocyte levels become dysregulated, mimicking the pathophysiology noted in certain psychiatric disorders and thus increasing rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders. Similarly, the fear-brain circuit is altered during the onset and prolonged management of CRPS, eventually transforming from pain-related fear to an overall manifestation of anxiety. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While the number of patients being diagnosed with comorbid mood disorders is growing, the current CRPS treatment protocol does not typically include the management of these psychiatric disorders. As more research is conducted to explore the physiological and psychological changes that occur with the onset of CRPS, mounting evidence suggests more mental health resources should be provided to alleviate CRPS-related symptoms, both physiological and psychological, and speed up the recovery timeline [4].</span>

<b>Dysregulation of Biomarkers in CRPS and Mood Disorders</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">TNF-α and Cortisol</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">During CRPS, depression, and anxiety, plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are increased by a statistically significant degree [5]. This cell-signaling protein is integral to maintaining a healthy immune response and stimulates the release of a corticotropin-releasing factor. With CRPS, TNF-α activates and sensitizes primary afferent nociceptors, leading to the characteristic excessive pain [5]. TNF-α not only plays an important role in the development of CRPS, but also in the development and severity of depression. In fact, the more severe the reported depressive symptoms, the higher the concentrations of plasma TNF-α [6].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The increased concentration of TNF-α may be explained by its role in the regulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis which is responsible for neuroendocrine modulation of the body’s stress response. With an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α in CRPS, the HPA axis increases the secretion of a corticotropin-releasing factor, adrenal-corticotropin hormone, and eventually cortisol. Prolonged elevations of cortisol lead to a shift in tryptophan usage from the tryptophan-serotonin pathway to the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway instead [7]. The shift away from the tryptophan-serotonin pathway greatly limits the production of serotonin, eventually interfering with mood stabilization, sleep cycle regulation, and neuronal communication [8]. Metabolites are then used in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway instead, leading to the production of two neurotoxic chemicals, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Quinolinic acid contributes to neurodegeneration seen in conditions like depression through free radical formation, mitochondrial malfunction, and energy store depletion. These changes trigger the mass destruction of neuronal cells which leads to the degeneration of brain functions such as memory and learning [9]. In fact, it has been suggested that elevated TNF-α levels is one precursor to the development of depression [5]. Therefore, TNF-α could be a potential biomarker for comorbid depression in CRPS patients.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Figure 1: TNF-a’s role in the dysregulation of tryptophan metabolism. Under normal conditions, tryptophan is transformed into serotonin in the brain and gut, producing regulatory effects on mood and the sleep cycle as well as promoting health communication between neurons. Under inflammatory conditions, like those seen in CRPS and depression, TNF-a secretion inhibits the production of serotonin through the upregulation of adrenal-corticotropin. Tryptophan is then utilized in the liver for production of neurotoxins through the Kynurenine pathway. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Catecholamines</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Following the acute stage of CRPS, stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the resulting release of catecholamines increase the production of another important cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6). When the body undergoes acute stress, the sympathetic nervous system is activated and causes the release of two catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones increase blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and dilate the pupils. Catecholamines are also regulators of IL-6, a cytokine that plays an important role in nociceptor sensitivity while also increasing chances of developing comorbid anxiety. Norepinephrine upregulates the translation of IL-6 by 49-fold, therefore increasing the plasma concentration of IL-6 after sympathetic stimulation [10]. In the case of CRPS, the initial trauma to the affected limb activates this fight-or-flight response and increases IL-6 levels. The chronic elevation of IL-6 not only leads to chronic inflammation, but also increases nociceptor sensitization and the transmission of signals between sensory neurons, both of which are linked to chronically elevated levels of pain [11]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Not only does IL-6 play an important role in inflammatory and pain responses and the onset of CRPS, the cytokine also modulates the expression of another cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1). IL-1 is critical for the onset of anxiety-type symptoms by dampening the activation of endocannabinoid receptor CB1R (GABA), which limits GABA’s anti-anxiety effects [12]. In fact, general anxiety disorder patients had statistically significant high levels of IL-6 through environmental stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system [7]. By adding the excitatory effects of CRPS on the sympathetic nervous system, there is no need for external stimulation to begin anxiety symptoms. For this reason, it has been suggested that elevated levels of IL-6 from the onset of CRPS can stimulate IL-1 and induce comorbid anxiety [12]. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4085 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/02/unnamed-1-1.png" alt="" width="365" height="512" />

<span style="font-weight: 400">Figure 2: Sympathetic stimulation following acute CRPS results in an increase in catecholamines. The subsequent upregulation of interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 dampens GABA’s anti-anxiety effects and leads to increased nociceptor activation. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Astrocytes</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In conjunction with the changes to cytokines in CRPS, anxiety and depression, subsequent changes to the functioning of astrocytes have been noted in all three diagnoses [13]. Astrocytes are a subclass of glial cells that hold a supportive function for neurons. Under typical conditions, astrocytes are responsible for modulating neuroendocrine functions, regulating synaptic transmission, and regulating glutamate levels in the body [14]. With CRPS, astrocytes become upregulated and activated via stimulation from excess pro-inflammatory cytokines, changing their gene expression to become A1 reactive astrocytes. A1 reactive astrocytes then go on to secrete neurotoxins and more pro-inflammatory cytokines [15]. The activation of A1 reactive astrocytes also induces higher levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, thus increasing the number of glial glutamate transporters on astrocytes [16]. This hyperactivity and hypersensitivity of astrocytes to glutamate trigger calcium release that increases neurotransmission within nociceptors and ultimately contributes to the intense and chronic pain associated with CRPS [15]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, patients with major depressive disorder show an mean increase of 35 μmol/L of glutamate concentration in the cortex, a statistically significant changeincrease that is indicative of the severity of depressive symptoms [17]. The shift in gene expression in astrocytes and upregulation of glutamate with the onset of CRPS not only increases nociceptor activation but also neurodegeneration through the reinforcement of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway discussed earlier. Interestingly, the increased concentration of glutamate inhibits the production of kynurenic acid and instead promotes the production of quinolinic acid [18]. As discussed, quinolinic acid is a potent neurotoxic compound that can lead to neurodegeneration associated with depression. The upregulation and activation of A1 reactive astrocytes in response to inflammation from CRPS increases extrasynaptic glutamate concentrations, causing hyperactivation of nociceptors and increased production of quinolinic acid. With this in mind, there is evidence that the pathophysiology of astrocytes during CRPS may increase the risk of comorbid depression.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>CRPS Psychology: Cycle of Pain-Related Anxiety</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The fear of pain, also known as harm-avoidance, complicates treating chronic pain conditions like CRPS. This is because certain treatments like physical or occupational therapy methods used in CRPS rehabilitation can quickly become unsuccessful if patients begin to avoid activities that increase symptoms or pain. These treatment techniques can include graded motor imagery, range-of-motion exercises, mirror therapy, desensitization, and electrical stimulation. Although these rehabilitation techniques may temporarily increase CRPS-related pain, therapy is an essential part of treatment and by avoiding painful activities, not only does the CRPS become increasingly worse, but the fear of pain is also cognitively reinforced. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">This reinforcement is seen in the fear-learning neural pathway, a series of neurons that extend from the left amygdala to the hippocampus, cerebellum, brainstem, and other parts of the central nervous system. The chronic pain of CRPS and subsequent fear of pain continuously activates neurons that extend to this fear-learning circuit, strengthening the connection between the left amygdala, the fear control center, and the hippocampus, the learning and memory center. This repetitive activation ultimately intensifies the fear brain circuit [19]. Consequently, the cycle of pain-related anxiety begins, transitioning from a fear of pain to an avoidance of pain which then further reinforces the fear of pain [2]. This phenomenon is identified in multiple studies, suggesting a more quantitative link between CRPS and anxiety.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In one study, a group of 64 CRPS patients were evaluated to determine psychological comorbidities. Twenty-eight individuals received a psychiatric diagnosis following the onset of CRPS, with 10 of those 28 diagnosed with anxiety disorders [20]. Not only did the study reveal these diagnoses, they also found that increased anxiety was directly linked to increased pain through the fear-brain pathway [13]. In fact, another study reported that 70 percent of CRPS patients had elevated pain-related fear scores [19]. While the anticipation of pain can elicit pain response, it can also lead to an avoidance of daily responsibilities, physical inactivity, disability, poorer long-term recovery, and higher rates of anxiety and other mood disorders [20]. As a result, the altered fear-brain circuits associated with CRPS increase the likelihood of developing comorbid anxiety.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">CRPS alters the body's physiology and changes certain psychological processes, increasing the chances for developing a comorbid psychiatric disorder. With the dysregulation of cytokines and astrocytes, the immune system’s functioning is disturbed, which leads to abnormal levels of kynurenine and serotonin similar to that of depression [5]. As the levels of kynurenine increase, so does the concentration of extrasynaptic glutamate, upregulating processes that signal both pain and depression [9]. The fear-brain circuit is also altered as pain signals become stronger and more frequent with CRPS, catastrophizing pain and ultimately leading to elevated levels of both pain and anxiety [3]. While pain itself can be debilitating, the simultaneous occurrence of pain and comorbid psychiatric disorders seen in CRPS can lead to avoidance of daily life, thereby worsening both disorders.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Today, most patients managing CRPS disorders are reluctant to express their psychological symptoms and look for help on their own, yet neglecting the psychological side often worsens the symptoms of their diagnosis and makes recovery more difficult [19].Current research suggests that CRPS treatment should shift towards focusing on the psychological components that intensify pain in order to holistically treat CRPS. Over the past few years, more studies have explored the relationship between CRPS and psychiatric disorders, but there has been less research into treatments that would help with both disorders simultaneously. Just as CRPS is often misdiagnosed as an invisible disorder, psychological symptoms may be overlooked or undertreated when physiological responses garner priority. A new perspective of CRPS that acknowledges this association is needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the disorder.</span>

<b>Author’s Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrote this piece of work for an assignment through my UWP 104F course, and felt very connected with it. I decided my topic to be about a disease known as ALS because my father was diagnosed when I was at a young age. At the age of nine, I did not understand the gravity of becoming sick, and how much the world can change when someone important in your life passes away. I did not understand how impactful a disease was until I had the experience as a family member. ALS became a topic of interest to me since then from class presentations about interesting scientific topics to college research papers and literature reviews. This literature review is something that I am proud of because it encompasses ALS as the disease that has involved me and my family. From this review, I hope readers learn more about ALS and how the current research can pave a way for future research in the treatment of ALS.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain [1-5]. Motor neuron degeneration inhibits the ability of the brain to send signals to the muscles to control movement. There are two types of motor neurons responsible for this communication: the upper and lower motor neurons. Lesions in upper motor neurons prevent the signal cascade to the lower motor neurons that send another signal responsible for muscle movement. This can lead to muscular atrophy, paralysis, and eventually death [1-5]. Various injuries such as damage to the spinal cord or strokes, as well as other factors like oxidative stress induced by free radicals, contribute to the destruction of motor neurons [6]. Approximately 5 of every 100,000 individuals will be affected by ALS and the average life expectancy after diagnosis is between 2-5 years [2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Many studies have focused on identifying the cause for motor neuron cell death and the genes involved in the development of the disease. Although bodily mechanisms by which motor neurons degenerate remain unclear, they are thought to encompass a non-cell autonomous process [3]. The purpose of this literature review is to analyze the current and potential treatments that can be effective toward individuals experiencing ALS. This article will focus on a current drug treatment called</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Edaravone</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">followed by potential treatments</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">astrocyte-based therapy and cell-based therapies.</span>

<b>Drug Treatments</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Edaravone is a free radical-scavenging drug that functions to protect motor neurons from free radicals and oxidative stress damage in the central nervous system (CNS) [2,6]. Edaravone effectively acts on oxidative stress by reducing the number of free radicals to slow disease progression. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">With the absence of a cure, such treatment options have mainly contributed to prolonged survival</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [6]. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">ALS Functional Rating Scale</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In this section, we will analyze the effect of Edaravone on disease progression through scoring of motor function by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R). The ALSFRS-R is an instrument designed for the clinical evaluation of functional status of ALS patients and efficacy of clinical trials [6]. It measures 12 aspects of physical function such as swallowing, breathing, and walking, scoring functioning ability from 4 (normal) to 0 (no ability) with a maximum total score of 48 and a minimum of 0.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Edaravone treatment on ALS patients</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">During normal disease progression, it is assumed that decline in functioning scores is almost linear [6]. When comparing ALSFRS-R scores between patients who received either placebo treatment or Edaravone treatment, there was a significantly faster decline in functional scores for those who received the placebo. This indicates a considerable loss in the ability to perform everyday tasks [2]. In conjunction with these results, a further study has shown greater improvements in ALSFRS-R scores for patients after beginning Edaravone treatment compared to the pre-treatment period [7]. The pre-treatment period lost an average of 4.7 points on the ALSFRS-R whereas the treatment period showed a smaller average loss of 2.3 points over the same time duration [7]. This indicates possible clinical efficacy for Edaravone due to its ability to effect a more gradual decline. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, compared to placebo, Edaravone remains effective for up to a year, after which survival rates start to decline [2]. Edaravone’s effectiveness is also more prevalent in the early stages of ALS progression, but long-term effects of Edaravone are not yet fully evaluated so results past a year are unclear. Further limitations to these studies, including a nonlinear difference in decline between functional rates of early stages of ALS and end stages of ALS, require more research before affirming the long-term health benefits through Edaravone [2,6,7]. Therefore, as a marketed drug, it is difficult to be sure of its full effectiveness from the lack of positive results in life expectancy of the target population. On the other hand, no detrimental effects or worsening of symptoms due to Edaravone were analyzed during patient trials besides a few side effects including bruising, headaches, and hypoxia [6]. Due to these factors, Edaravone remains a partially beneficial drug. </span>

<b>Potential Therapeutic Options</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although Edaravone’s effectiveness is still actively being deciphered, there have been studies on whether </span><span style="font-weight: 400">other types of cellular targets within the brain and stem cells, such as astrocytes, could help slow down or halt disease progression and thus be effective treatments for ALS </span><span style="font-weight: 400">[1,3,4]. Astrocytes are a type of glial cell within the CNS that is inflamed under the diseased state [1]. Most of the following research involves the SOD1-G93A transgenic mice expressing the human SOD1 gene with G93A mutation. It is an important mouse model for studying ALS as it presents many of the pathological symptoms experienced by patients, including motor impairment and motor neuron death, allowing for an analogous simulation [1]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In the current state of medication development, the SOD1-G93A transgenic mice are utilized for their relation to astrocytes, a promising target for effective treatments. The increasing number of studies performed on astrocytes show them to be crucially involved in ALS through their influence on motor neuron fate and disease progression. The studies discussed will present multiple experiments on the SOD1-G93A transgene, and explain how elimination and/or alteration of this gene can help slow prominent signs of disease and extend lifespan [1,5].</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Role of Astrocytes in ALS</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Upon a specific signal within the CNS, astrocytes can transform into either their reactive A1 state characterized by promotion of neurodegeneration and toxicity or their neuroprotective A2 state which promotes healing and repair of injury [3,9]. Among ALS patients, the reactive A1 astrocytes are dominant along with the mutant transgenic SOD1-G93A, contributing toxic components that participate in ALS pathology [1]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Amongst these pathologies, researchers investigate neuroinflammation, characterized by inflammation of the nervous tissue, to prove its benefits for minimizing reactive astrocytes [1]. Neuroinflammatory stimuli like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lead to a signal transduction cascade that can secrete immunologically active molecules like IL-1α, TNFα, and C1q that transform resting astrocytes to their neurotoxic A1 state [1]. These reactive astrocytes will lose regular functions and secrete factors toxic to neurons [1,3]. Moreover, isolated astrocytes from ALS patients were found to be toxic to healthy, cultured motor neurons [3]. This indicates </span><span style="font-weight: 400">the involvement of astrocytes in motor neuron death that can lead to a progressive decline of motor function</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> [3]. Lowering the prevalence of neuroinflammation may contribute to a decrease in motor neuron death, and therefore delayed progression of ALS.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Astrocyte-Based Therapy</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To minimize neuroinflammatory effects of ALS, Guttenplan et al. determined that knockout, or the genetically modified absence of IL-1α, TNFα, and C1q in SOD1-G93A mice did not produce any reactive astrocytes [1]. This triple knockout was also linked to the possibility of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes becoming a therapeutic target for ALS. The triple knockout mice presented with lower levels of reactive astrocyte marker C3 and had a significantly extended lifespan of over 50% compared to regular SOD1-G93A mice [1]. Treatments that implement this mechanism of lowering neuroinflammation can contribute to a turning point in increasing efficacy rates of therapies involved in ALS. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, diagnosis is primarily followed after the presence of symptoms [1]. An approach to treatment included restoring normal functionality of endogenous astrocytes through the transplantation of healthy astrocytes in patients [3]. These transplanted healthy astrocytes can provide neuroprotection through reduction of misfolded proteins in motor neurons. However, they can also transform into neurotoxic A1 astrocytes when in the diseased environment of the CNS [3]. The mechanisms through which transplanted astrocytes act continue to be thoroughly understood, yet provide a promising target for an ALS targeted therapy [1,3]. Delay in disease progression may be more effective with a combination of therapies attacking both reactive astrocytes and motor neurons compared to individual therapies [1].</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cell-Based Therapy</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Another approach that has been studied as a potential therapeutic target for ALS is through stem cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent precursors that can be prompted to release neurotrophic factors released by A2 astrocytes and have shown to be beneficial in the regeneration of healthy cells [3]. Transplantation of the same individual’s MSCs induced to secrete neurotrophic factors showed early signs of safety and treatment effectiveness [3].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, a specific stem cell therapy “Neuro-Cells”, a combination of MSCs and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), along with anti-inflammatory measures was administered to both SOD1-G93A mice and FUS-tg mice, a variant of the standard SOD1-G93A strain [4]. In SOD-1 and FUS-tg, inflammation contributes to disease progression, allowing for comparison investigation in these two mutations [4]. When tested on rats subjected to spinal cord injury, this mixture had an anti-inflammatory effect, thus improving motor function and decreasing concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid [4]. Muscle degeneration among FUS-tg mice was also compared during Neuro-Cell injections. Muscular atrophy was noticed to be partly rescued by the mixed stem cell therapy. To verify these results, Neuro-Cells were administered to SOD1-G93A mice. Results showed an indication of improved motor function similar to that of the FUS-tg mice, thus providing further evidence of disease counteraction [4]. These signs of efficacy and preclinical studies of transplantation of MSCs and HSCs are indicators of beneficial treatments from the usage of stem cells through reduction of motor neuron death, prolonged survival and improved motor performances [3]. Coincidingly, according to de Munter et al., stem cell therapy should be utilized as a part of the cell-based treatment of ALS due to the knowledge present already in this field [4]. Even so, more research is needed to define the anti-inflammatory mechanisms in ALS pathology and other effects that “Neuro-Cells” have on ALS.</span>

<b>Discussion/Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">While there are currently effective drug treatments available for ALS, there is still research being conducted on these drugs to better ensure quality and effectiveness. Edaravone’s ability to slow disease progression remains minimal or ineffective to patients who are past the beginning stages of ALS progression, and toward end-stage ALS, respectively. Decline in patients experiencing ALS occurs non-linearly with a rapid decline toward the end-stage, and so clinical effects of Edaravone may not be beneficial. Its therapeutic effects are yet to be better understood and whether or not their effectiveness is due in part to the drug. Although it is currently being used as a treatment option, Edaravone could be further improved for efficacy.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In association, potential treatment options of astrocyte-based therapies and cell-based therapies play an important role in the future of ALS. Targeting astrocytes and neuroinflammation, and utilizing stem cell therapy can provide benefits to slowing disease progression. However, much like the current drugs, there is still much to understand about other subpopulations of astrocytes and stem cells that could contribute to ALS pathology. The intertwined participation of therapies is important to note as it could provide greater benefits to patients seeking out future treatments. Although options of treatment are currently limited, these studies suggest potential therapeutic approaches that can be optimized to halt or slow disease progression. Currently, stem cells are encouraged to be part of treatment in ALS patients, suggesting its potential in reducing inflammation and therefore can be highly effective in minimizing motor neuron death. Additionally, astrocytes are becoming a major direction in the studies of ALS, due to its direct involvement in motor neuron death associated with the disease. Astrocytes may become the center of research in the near future and lead to a more efficient slowing of disease progression compared to the currently approved drugs. With more studies, the cellular mechanisms contributing to the deterioration of motor neurons involved in ALS can lead to promising treatments with greater efficacy against the disease. In due time, we can hope to see an increase in the average life expectancy of 2-5 years to much longer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Author’s note: </strong>I hope to raise awareness about the barriers that transgender individuals face in order to obtain mammograms, and possible methods for increasing breast cancer screenings in this population. This article is meant for the general public and informs readers about some of the disparities that members of the LGBTQ community face, while also exploring methods that can be used to potentially bridge this gap in care. I chose this topic because I previously read an article about the disparities in cancer screenings in minority communities, and I wanted to research more about this topic specifically for transgender populations in relation to mammograms. Through this article, I hope readers can become more aware of how both transgender individuals and healthcare professionals lack knowledge on mammogram screening requirements, the barriers that can decrease mammogram rates, and methods that can improve breast cancer screening rates in transgender populations.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>ABSTRACT</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Objective: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">The aim is to analyze reasons for the gap in transgender breast cancer screenings, including the lack of proper screening guidelines and barriers to obtaining mammograms, and what can be done to alleviate this issue to improve healthcare for transgender individuals. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Methods: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">This review analyzed primary research articles from the past three years from PubMed and Google Scholar. The sources were found with the key words “transgender breast cancer screening” and “transgender mammograms”, and were used to determine the extent of the disparity of breast cancer screenings for transgender individuals, existing knowledge of transgender mammogram requirements, barriers to obtain screenings, and methods to combat this issue. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Results: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender individuals have decreased rates of breast cancer screenings compared to cisgender individuals due to healthcare workers’ lack of knowledge about transgender health and barriers for obtaining mammograms. Having more training for healthcare professionals, encouraging a more inclusive environment, and having organ inventories for patients to ensure all necessary screenings are met are a few ways to combat this issue and decrease disparities for transgender individuals to obtain these crucial mammograms. </span>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender individuals have disproportionately fewer mammograms than cisgender individuals [1]. According to the CDC, mammograms are pictures of the breast taken with an X-ray that physicians use to detect breast cancer [2]. By analyzing the current breast cancer screening rates of transgender individuals, understanding current knowledge of healthcare professionals on transgender health, addressing barriers that can prevent breast cancer screenings, and exploring ways to increase the number of mammograms transgender individuals obtain, this paper aims to encourage mammogram screenings to benefit transgender health [1, 3-11]. These studies are crucial for recognizing the barriers that prevent transgender individuals from getting mammograms, while also exploring the ways to counter such barriers to ensure the transgender population obtains these preventative screenings. Current research presents decreased breast cancer screening rates and lack of concrete breast cancer screening guidelines for transgender patients compared to cisgender patients [1, 9-11]. Moreover, research shows limited understanding of transgender health for healthcare workers [4-5]. One of the main barriers to obtaining mammograms is anxiety, including emotional and financial distress [3, 7, 11]. However, current research also presents potential solutions to the problem, including having more training for healthcare personnel, and having organ inventories for patients to understand each individual’s unique needs to help alleviate this issue by increasing the mammogram rates of transgender individuals [6, 8, 11]. This review focuses on current literature that provides information about access to breast cancer screenings for transgender individuals and how access can be improved.</span>

<b>DISCUSSION</b>

<b>Screening Rates and Knowledge on Screening Requirements</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender individuals have decreased rates of mammograms compared to cisgender individuals [1, 9-11]. Both a survey of transgender individuals from Iowa and a similar survey of transgender people from Dallas, Texas found that transgender men have lower breast cancer screening rates than cisgender females [1, 9].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">However, there is variation in the percentage of transgender individuals obtaining mammograms in these different parts of the country. The Iowa study found that 75% of transgender men have obtained mammograms, a lower percentage than the 94% of cisgender women who have had mammograms [1]. On the other hand, the survey results from Texas indicate that only 40% of transgender males assigned female at birth have had mammograms at some point in their lives [9]. This demonstrates how there is variation across different parts of the country in regards to breast cancer screening rates for transgender men, although in both cases, rates are lower than that of cisgender individuals [1, 9]. These variations can be due to cultural differences in obtaining screenings, different state guidelines for screenings, or different socioeconomic statuses of individuals taking the survey that can affect whether or not they can afford their screenings [4, 11]. Moreover, researchers have also determined that rates of clinical breast exams, during which healthcare professionals use their hands to check for lumps in breast tissue, are even lower than the mammogram rates for transgender individuals [1, 12]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender individuals also have limited knowledge of breast cancer screening requirements [9, 11]. In fact, according to researchers, over 65% of the sexual and gender minority community, which includes transgender individuals, is unaware of the screenings they require [11]. Other researchers confirm that there is a lack of knowledge in regards to the healthcare needs of transgender individuals, which translates to decreased knowledge in transgender populations themselves about the need for breast cancer screenings [8, 10].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Additionally, more than half of transgender individuals who were eligible for mammograms have not completed them which, according to researchers, demonstrates a limited understanding of organ-specific screening requirements [8]. Healthcare professionals also have limited knowledge on transgender mammogram requirements [4-5, 8].</span>

<b>Healthcare Professionals’ Existing Knowledge and Practices</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Radiologists, genetic counselors, and healthcare staff have limited information about transgender breast cancer screening requirements and are less comfortable asking patients for their pronouns [4-5, 8].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, 65% of radiologists did not recognize the importance of breast cancer screening guidelines for transgender men without chest surgery, and genetic counselors did not have the proper knowledge about the importance of breast cancer screenings for transgender women on estrogen therapy [4-5]. This demonstrates how more guidelines and protocols in relation to transgender mammograms need to be emphasized in healthcare environments [4, 11].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Both genetic counselors and radiologists agree that more research should be done to improve healthcare for transgender populations [4-5].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Genetic counselors reported in a survey feeling comfortable asking both transgender and cisgender patients about their pronouns [5].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Similarly, most radiologists claimed they felt comfortable asking patients about sex and gender identity for mammograms [4]. However, a survey of radiologists found that only 13% of physicians actually record both the sex and gender of transgender patients [4]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Also, in practice, when researchers observed providers and staff in another study, most healthcare professionals hesitated to ask the patient for their pronouns as they claimed they were uncomfortable and scared of offending the patient [8]. This demonstrates how although some healthcare professionals may claim to be comfortable asking about the gender and sex of patients, they may not execute this in practice, possibly because they are scared of offending the patient [4, 5, 8]. Transgender individuals may still develop breast cancer whether or not they identify with their biological sex, so it is imperative that healthcare providers ask for both gender and sex for each individual so they can obtain the preventative breast cancer screenings they require [3]. However, there can be many barriers to prevent access to such screenings [3, 7, 10-11].</span>

<b>Barriers and Inclusivity</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Two of the main barriers for obtaining mammograms include anxiety or emotional distress associated with the appointment in transgender patients, as well as discrimination [3, 7, 10-11].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Transgender individuals have a disproportionately higher prevalence of anxiety. In an interview with one transgender individual, the patient stated that he was anxious about getting a breast cancer screening done because he did not want to stand out as the only man in a predominantly female division of the clinic, and this anxiety prevented him from getting screened [3, 7]. In fact, around half of transgender individuals do not get preventative cancer screenings because it causes them more emotional distress, on average, than these screenings do for cisgender individuals [11]. Such anxiety can also stem from the fear of being treated as their gender assigned at birth as opposed to the gender they identify as [7]. Another possible source of emotional distress comes from not having proper guidance on what screenings are recommended [4, 11].Although screening guidelines exist, there are no official nationwide screening recommendations published that can provide information on, for example, how having hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries can affect the types of screenings needed [4, 11]. Financial insecurities are a third source of emotional distress, with transgender individuals reporting lower incomes and health insurance coverage, causing around 50% of this population to postpone preventative cancer screenings as a result [3-4 10-11].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, transgender individuals experience higher rates of discrimination compared to cisgender groups, with around 52% of transgender individuals experiencing some type of discrimination, both during cancer screenings and for individuals who have received cancer treatment [3-4, 10].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Some examples of such discrimination include how 20% of transgender individuals were denied healthcare because they were gender-nonconforming, and how 20% of this population were also denied physician care for being transgender, which can lead to distrust in healthcare providers and a reduction in mammograms for transgender individuals [11].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Lack of inclusivity in medical settings can be another barrier for obtaining breast cancer screenings, and there can be contradicting information about what is considered inclusivity between transgender individuals and other outside populations, including researchers [3,7].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">For example, based on a survey sent to radiology device companies, some of which provide the technology necessary for mammograms, researchers found that all responding companies had a third gender option of “other” when registering patients [3]. The only companies that responded were the ones that had more gender options than male and female, but the companies that did not respond may still have only two gender options [3]. Based on this information, researchers concluded that since there are more options than male and female on radiology devices, this demonstrates a more inclusive environment for transgender patients [3]. However, in an interview with one transgender individual, they mention how they feel offended when they are treated as the “other” just because they do not fit into any of the dominant gender groups, since it makes them feel alienated and unacknowledged [7]. This demonstrates how what may seem like positive language and inclusive language to some people can actually be alienating to transgender individuals in practice. Such language can, in fact, dissuade transgender individuals from obtaining mammograms, presenting another barrier to receiving the care they need [7,11]. It is crucial to combat such barriers to improve mammogram rates in transgender populations [3-4, 6-8, 11].</span>

<b>Methods to Improve Mammogram Rates</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There are many methods that can be used to improve mammogram rates in transgender populations [3-4, 6-7, 11]. For example, training physicians and other hospital staff on methods for providing a more inclusive environment for transgender individuals can help patients feel more comfortable obtaining mammograms [3, 6, 11].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Also, providing more comfortable spaces, such as waiting rooms and changing rooms, at mammogram centers can help transgender patients feel more reassured and less anxious [11].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Another method to increase inclusivity is to have LGBTQ-specific mammogram services, or specific days the clinic is open just for LGBTQ individuals, so transgender patients would feel more reassured that the clinic is LGBTQ-friendly to ensure a more gender-affirming experience [7, 11]. It is also crucial for doctors and nurses themselves to be more understanding and listen to the patients’ concerns, since this can help build trust between the patient and provider [3, 11].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">For example, one interviewed transgender patient mentioned that their physician not only affirmed their gender, but was also not forcing or chiding the patient into getting their previous gender-related preventative screenings, which made them feel a lot more comfortable and respected [7]. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Once this trust is built, however, transgender patients are more likely to follow the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">physician’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> screening recommendations, the physician provides, including for mammograms., to ensure transgender patients obtain the screenings they need [6, 9].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Physicians can also help build knowledge on mammograms for transgender individuals by enrolling their patients in a national research database that can consolidate  data about the screenings provided to patients and the outcomes of those screenings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Having this data can help healthcare professionals nationwide gain a more holistic view of the rates of certain cancers in the transgender populations, and what screenings should be emphasized for to transgender patients, as a result, to provide early detection for those specific cancers [4]</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. This can provide more holistic and concrete guidelines for mammograms to the entire country [4]. This database can present screening and outcome information of transgender individuals from around the country, providing a way to detect cancer rates and change how healthcare professionals treat patients based on the needs of the population [4]. Another way to ensure a more holistic understanding of each patient is to recommend organ-specific screenings, since each individual is unique, to ensure that patients do not miss any crucial cancer screenings, including mammograms [8].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, healthcare professionals can ensure that no patient is left behind when it comes to obtaining such screenings. </span>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<b></b><span style="font-weight: 400">Overall, there are decreased amounts of breast cancer screenings done in transgender populations compared to cisgender populations, which is accompanied by a lack of knowledge of healthcare professionals on transgender screening requirements and barriers to screenings [1, 3-5, 7-11]. However, it has been shown that promoting doctor screening recommendations, having organ inventories, and providing a more supportive environment can positively combat this issue [3-4, 6-8, 11].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">There are still more ways to improve screening rates by training healthcare providers and having a more inclusive environment, and further research needs to be done in this area to show the effects of such training on transgender mammogram screening rates [3, 6, 11].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Whereas some researchers argue that there is inclusivity in healthcare environments with radiology equipment having the third option for gender as “other”, transgender individuals themselves may not consider this language to be inclusive and it could instead make them feel sidelined in screening centers [3, 7].</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Having more input from transgender individuals themselves on how they can be supported in breast cancer screening centers, and during the mammogram procedure, can increase comfort in healthcare environments to improve mammogram rates in this population [7]. </span>

<b>Introduction </b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Over 300,000 people reported having cholera in 2020 [12]. This infectious disease is spread by water or seafood contaminated by the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vibrio cholerae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">bacteria. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">V. cholerae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> can survive in the open ocean within phytoplankton [5]. The bacteria also spreads into inland water sources such as rivers, getting into people’s drinking water. This spread of cholera is affected by climate variables such as precipitation, temperature, and oceanic conditions [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13]. Climate patterns such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) influence local weather patterns in coastal regions, causing more phytoplankton blooms [2, 11]. Climate change also disrupts water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure, [4] creating favorable environmental conditions for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">V. cholerae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">to thrive [2]. As climate change causes fluctuations in weather patterns and coastal biology, researchers need a reliable method for tracking and predicting cholera. Early warning systems are key for health officials to be able to take proper preventative measures–from vaccine deployment campaigns to emergency clean water storage–to reduce the prevalence and fatality of cholera.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Satellites are one method to gather measurements of variables that affect the spread of cholera. Using electromagnetic reflection, satellites provide remotely-sensed geophysical data on variables such as temperature, water quality, precipitation, or vegetation [10]. Researchers use remotely sensed data in conjunction with algorithms and statistical analyses to model cholera outbreaks and predict how changing variables will alter disease spread. Satellite data is widely accessible, often free, and provides data over huge temporal-spatial ranges [5, 10]. Researchers are able to compile their data without being physically near the areas they are studying [10]. This review will analyze how researchers have developed methods for predicting cholera outbreaks using remotely sensed data, and demonstrate how refinement of these techniques will be crucial to combating cholera outbreaks amidst climate change. </span>

<b>Collection of Satellite Data</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Natural disasters are increasing in intensity and frequency, heightening the opportunity for a cholera epidemic [2, 4]. Cholera epidemics have historically begun after storms, such as after Hurricane Matthew in Haiti [4]. Hurricanes can destroy WASH infrastructure, allowing cholera to seep into water supplies and leave people vulnerable to drinking this contaminated water [4]. Detecting outbreaks and identifying the source are crucial steps in managing deaths from cholera; it is also crucial to improve sanitation and access to clean drinking water and increase vaccination campaigns. These steps can be aided by remotely sensed data that feeds into prediction models [2].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Remotely sensed data measures variables that are known to be connected to cholera incidence. Huq et al. (2017) published research using remotely sensed precipitation, wind swath, geophysical landmarks, and population density after Hurricane Matthew struck Haiti in October 2016 [4]. The researchers created a map that showed areas at high risk for cholera and were able to predict where outbreak hotspots would occur up to four weeks after the hurricane [4].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Other useful variables include sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), land surface temperature (LST), precipitation, chlorophyll-a concentration (Ch-a), and soil moisture (SM) [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13]. SST and Ch-a are indicators of a habitat that is suitable for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Vibrio cholerae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">growth [5, 6]. Flooding from extreme precipitation can flush seawater carrying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">V. cholerae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">into inland rivers, estuaries, or drinking water [4, 5, 6]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Satellites can provide data on climate variables in regions that health officials cannot access safely, or after a natural disaster when researchers cannot collect field data due to accessibility or time constraints [4]. This data could help researchers identify particular regions at risk for a cholera outbreak after an extreme weather event and help policymakers make informed decisions about where to implement vaccination programs or establish WASH infrastructure. And in districts where cholera survives endemically, remotely sensed data could help identify outbreak sources or thresholds for when an outbreak becomes an epidemic. Satellite data on EVCs and WASH infrastructure needs to remain publicly and freely available, and will be particularly effective in identifying potential cholera outbreaks as climate change increases the intensity and incidence of natural disasters and climate patterns that suit </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">V. cholerae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">proliferation.</span>

<b>Turning Raw Data into Models</b>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Tracking Essential Climate Variables</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Satellites provide data across vast geospatial and temporal ranges about the Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) correlated with cholera outbreaks. Remote sensing systems allow researchers to build models of cholera dynamics based on these relationships [5]. Fooladi et al. (2021) used precipitation data from 1983 to 2016 to compute a non-standardized precipitation index (nSPI) in the Gavkhooni basin in Iran. Their model demonstrates how previous understanding of the environmental conditions that precede cholera outbreaks can be combined with satellite data to make novel predictions about disease outbreaks [3]. For example, an algal bloom is an exponential growth of phytoplankton, which requires chlorophyll-a to photosynthesize sunlight, grow, and produce nutrients [5]. Phytoplankton is a reservoir of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">V. cholerae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and can be seen from space because of its green pigment</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, Ch-a is a close enough proxy to phytoplankton for modeling the levels of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">V. cholerae </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">bacteria in an area [5]. In 2021, Lai et al. used Landsat images from NASA and Sentinel-2A images from the European Space Agency to measure Ch-a in the Guanting Reservoir, one of the main water supply sources for Beijing, China. They developed a model between variables in the satellite images (bands, normalized difference vegetation index, surface algal bloom index, Apple algorithm values) and Ch-a [8]. Their studies in 2016, 2017, and 2019 predicted Ch-a to be correlated with the actual measured chlorophyll-a levels at a 0.05 significance level [8]. This data allowed the researchers to model trends of Ch-a and water nutrition status, which has applications to reservoir eutrophication statuses [8] and thus disease transmission.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Machine Learning</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Variables such as LST and SM can be linked to cholera outbreaks through machine learning (ML) algorithms. ML elucidates complex relationships between variables, such as the risk of a cholera outbreak and EVCs [1]. Statistically analyzing input data taken from satellites, ML allows researchers to build models that predict an output (i.e. an outbreak) [9]. Algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Linear Discriminant Analysis have been examined by researchers [1, 9]. Campbell et al. (2020) found RF to be the most effective classifier due to its superior performance in handling oversampled and imbalanced datasets, yielding a high true positive rate (probability that an actual trend is correctly predicted) of 89.5% when fitting a model combining a season encoder, location encoder, LST, Ch-a, SSS, sea level anomalies, SM, and their lag values (using past variables to predict future variables) [1].  Campbell et al.’s model (2020) combined five EVCs and pulled data across forty districts of India from 2010 to 2018 [1]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In a 2013 study, Jutla acknowledged that Ch-a alone cannot serve as an accurate predictive factor of a cholera outbreak, as other organic matters and detritus not represented by a chlorophyll index can also contribute to the presence of cholera bacteria [6]. To account for this, Jutla developed the Satellite Water Marker (SWM) index, which uses wavelength radiance to identify coastal conditions and predict cholera outbreaks one to two months in advance [5]. SWM is based on the shifts in the difference between blue (412 nm) and green (555 nm) wavelengths, which determine the turbidity (impurity) of water [5]. A high correlation between SWM in the early winter months in the Bay of Bengal and cholera peaks in the spring was observed, and likely related to multiple coastal conditions, not just Ch-a [5]. Jutla et al. (2013) tested the Bay of Bengal SWM in Mozambique, where there is one annual cholera peak as opposed to two. They again found that the SWM was a more accurate indicator of cholera than Ch-a alone. Julta’s index was used again by Ogata et al. (2021) to determine the specific environmental conditions in previous seasons that precede cholera outbreaks in northern coastal regions in the Bay of Bengal. They linked spring cholera to summer precipitation and the previous fall/winter SWM. Meanwhile, La Niña-driven SST deviations and floods caused by high summer rainfall anticipated fall cholera outbreaks [11]. Variability in climate conditions and SWM over decades indicates that the predictive models are ever-shifting [11]. A clear understanding of shifts in climate patterns over time is thus integral to accurate forecasting.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400">Challenges and Limitations</span></i>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Remotely sensed data is integral to developing timely and accurate predictive models and early warning systems for cholera outbreaks. There is no set of ECVs or a specific ML technique that can be applied universally, especially when looking at endemic versus epidemic cholera [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9]. Many studies struggled with a lack of field data against which to test their models, particularly after extreme weather events which may destroy existing data collection infrastructure [7]. Researchers were also challenged by imbalanced datasets when programming ML algorithms, even with particularly resilient algorithms like RF [1, 9].  Cholera is notoriously difficult to model because it can occur through multiple pathways of transmission, and cholera outbreaks are related to several climate variables through complex relationships [5, 6, 9]. Further testing in diverse regions, under various climate conditions, utilizing assorted ECVs, and employing numerous ML techniques is necessary to make these models as accurate as possible. Future studies should focus on long-term observations of variables known to be connected to cholera and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">V. cholerae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, such as sea surface salinity [1, 11]. Future models also need to take socioeconomic data into account [1, 4].</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of this review was to demonstrate how and why remotely sensed data is being used to predict cholera outbreaks, particularly as climate change makes local weather patterns more unpredictable. Researchers do not indicate a lack of sufficient satellite or ML technology necessary to make satellite data-driven cholera prediction models commonplace. However, different regions around the world have different seasonal and interannual variability of cholera transmission [5], making it difficult to develop a universal model. Therefore, future studies should emphasize testing various ML methods with diverse EVCs worldwide. Future studies should also work to formulate indices such as the SWM that can be applied over different geographical regions with minimal alterations. As climate change intensifies, cholera prediction models are vital components of disease prevention. Cholera is unlikely to be eradicated [5], but there are steps that can be taken to control its transmission and minimize its mortality. These steps are more effective the more time officials have to deploy them, so models that can provide significant lead times are critical.</span>

</strong>
Neonatal Isoerythrolysis: An Overview</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Neonatal isoerythrolysis (NI) is an alloimmune disease, an immune response against non-self-antigens from the same species. A non-self antigen can be any foreign substance that can trigger the host’s immune system. Hemolytic anemia is the most common symptom of NI, where a newborn’s red blood cells are the non-self-antigens, and are targeted and destroyed by maternal antibodies [1, 2, 3]. These antibodies are absorbed when the newborn ingests colostrum, otherwise known as “first milk” [1, 2]. In essence, neonatal isoerythrolysis occurs when an offspring inherits the father’s blood type while the mother’s blood type contains antibodies against it. Antibodies to red blood cells are commonly referred to as anti-erythrocyte antibodies, and if they are passed to another animal via ingestion or transfusion, they will attack the host’s own red blood cells at a rate at which they cannot be replaced. If left untreated, NI is fatal. Neonatal isoerythrolysis is most common in cats and horses, and is rarely observed in other species [1,2]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Colostrum is highly important because neonates (newborns) ingest the mother’s antibodies to gain passive immunity, the first layer of protection against pathogens after birth. For the first 24 hours of life, neonates are able to absorb antibodies in the gut. After this window, the gut begins to close and absorption decreases dramatically. Because of this, it is important to ingest colostrum as soon as possible after birth [2]. Isoerythrolysis occurs when those maternal antibodies become alloantibodies, which specifically target non-self red blood cells–in this case, the foal’s– and causes hemolysis [4]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The most common symptoms are weakness, pale mucous membranes, icterus (jaundice), tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), and tachypnoea (rapid breathing) [1, 5, 6, 7]. Symptoms can occur hours to a week within ingestion of colostrum, and death will occur if left untreated. Across all species, offspring that are positive for NI should not drink colostrum from their biological mothers. Preventing ingestion of colostrum containing alloantibodies can be done by muzzling the offspring (in the case of foals) or removing them from the mother (in the case of kittens). The mother must be milked periodically to eliminate any remaining colostrum, so that she can later produce milk that is harmless. In the meantime, the newborn(s) should be fed colostrum from a different animal.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Because neonatal isoerythrolysis results in hemolytic anemia, blood transfusions are a common treatment. Similar to human blood transfusions, horses and cats can receive transfusions from any individual with the same blood type. However, in horses it is highly recommended to use the blood from the mother after it is washed with saline and centrifuged to get rid of maternal alloantibodies [1]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To the untrained eye, the various symptoms of NI might appear to be the result of a contagious pathogen rather than an alloimmune disease. Nonetheless, it is very easy to prevent–conscientious breeders should preemptively blood test breeding pair, and test the pregnant mother again two weeks before parturition (birth) [</span><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]. This would serve to inform the breeders about potentially conflicting blood types and prevent the conception of a foal that could become a victim of NI. Additionally, care should be taken when breeding females that have already given birth, or have received blood transfusions or certain vaccinations. Ultimately, the best method of combating NI is through prevention: a simple blood test of a breeding pair will be able to predict whether the neonate will develop this condition or not [1, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400">].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Figure 1. The red blood cells of a neonate carrying the father’s blood type is at risk of being targeted by anti-erythrocyte antibodies contained in the mother’s colostrum</span>

<b>Neonatal Isoerythrolysis in Equines</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Neonatal isoerythrolysis is most common in horses and mules, although it is also possible in other equids such as zebras. There are 16 blood types for horses; of these types, Aa and Qa are the most likely to become antigenic and cause NI [1, 2, 3]. Reactions to other blood types, such as Qc and Db, have also been observed [6]. When a mare is exposed to these antigens from a pregnancy or blood transfusion, she will produce alloantibodies that will attack the red blood cells of her future foal. This becomes complicated when a mare that has previously given birth to unaffected foals is introduced to an antigen, putting her future foals at risk for NI [1, 2].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, there is something called a “donkey factor,” which is a type of red blood cell antigen specific to donkeys [8]. Thus, horses cannot receive blood transfusions from donkeys, but donkeys can receive blood transfusions from horses [1, 8, 9]. The donkey factor means that there is a much higher chance of Neonatal Isoerythrolysis occurring in mares pregnant with mule foals–10% in horse x donkey crosses compared to 1% when breeding horses. However, this is only a problem for mares that have carried more than one mule foal [7, 9].</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">In horses, NI is diagnosed with a Coomb’s test, which detects hemolytic anemia by cross-matching the mare's blood serum with her foal’s red blood cells. If the result is positive, agglutination (clumping in the test tube) will occur [5, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">10</span><span style="font-weight: 400">]. While the Coomb’s test is a definitive diagnosis that evaluates hemolysis, NI can also be prevented by conducting a jaundiced foal agglutination test (JFAT), which is a cruder method utilizing the mare’s colostrum and her foal’s erythrocytes. As with the Coomb’s test, if agglutination occurs there is a high risk of NI and the foal should be prevented from nursing [2, 5]. Thus, it is important to run these tests as soon as possible to prevent the foal from nursing from its biological mother [11]. Colostrum from an unrelated donor should be fed to the foal, and the biological mother should be milked periodically. Fortunately, antibody absorption drops dramatically after the first 24 hours of life, so this solution need not be implemented long-term. However, for foals that have already ingested colostrum and become severely anemic to the point of not wanting to nurse, blood transfusions are recommended. The blood should be cross-matched, and if that is not possible it is recommended to transfuse blood from an Aa Qa blood type negative gelding(a castrated male horse) [7]. In all cases, it is not recommended to separate a foal from its mother due to separation anxiety; thus, the foal should be muzzled. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Figure 2. The Coomb’s test detects hemolytic anemia, which is a common symptom of Neonatal Isoerythrolysis, by cross-matching the mare’s blood serum with her foal’s red blood cells</span>

<b>Neonatal Isoerythrolysis in Felines</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Neonatal Isoerythrolysis may also occur in cats, and although this condition is much rarer in felines compared to equines, the mortality rate is still very high [12]. There are 3 blood types in cats: A, B, and AB [12, 13]. Type A is the most common by far, and it is also dominant to type B [14]. Type AB is not well-documented, but it is known that it is the rarest blood type. It is dominant to type B, but recessive to type A[12]. If the queen (mother cat) has type B, she naturally produces alloantibodies to blood type A. Neonatal Isoerythrolysis will occur if a Type B female is bred with a Type A tomcat so that the kittens are type A/B. In the United States, Type A is the most common blood type among cats, while Type B is rare [12]. It should be noted that wild felines share the same AB blood-grouping, so diagnosis and treatment may be applied to zoos in addition to domestic homes [13]. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400"> In cats, diagnosis is based on clinical signs of the kittens and blood typing. Clinical signs include weak nursing, pale or jaundiced mucous membranes, and dark red-brown urine [12].</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> If blood work is done, it will show anemia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Because feline litter sizes are large, it is common to use placental blood for testing. It should be noted that kittens in a litter may show varying levels of symptom severity; researchers theorize that this is due to different levels of colostrum intake. Unlike equines, felines can be directly removed from their mother and housed with another queen as soon as symptoms appear. </span>

<b>Neonatal Isoerythrolysis in Other Species</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Although these instances are much rarer compared to cats and horses, neonatal isoerythrolysis has also been observed in cattle, dogs, and pigs [15, 16, 17]. Interestingly, NI is not a natural phenomenon in cattle–it was first observed in 1960 and was caused by homologous blood vaccines administered by veterinarians [17]. The threshold of response to these vaccines was variable so that the number of injections that would induce symptoms differed between every individual.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Hemolytic diseases similar to Neonatal Isoerythrolysis exist in humans as erythroblastosis fetalis or Rh disease [18]. It is termed differently because alloantibodies can cross the placenta during human pregnancy, but can’t in other mammals–offspring would only come into contact with these antibodies after birth via colostrum. In human blood typing, the “+” and “-” signs refer to the Rh factor. If an individual is positive, the Rh protein is present on the surface of their red blood cells, and if the Rh protein is not present then the individual tests negative. Rh disease occurs when one develops a hypersensitive immune response, developing anti-Rh factor antibodies that kill healthy Rh-containing blood cells. However, Rh disease can only occur within a specific circumstance: if the father is positive for Rh factor and the mother is negative, yielding an Rh-positive offspring. Even under these conditions, only the second child would be in danger of Rh disease–the mother builds antibodies against the Rh factor during her first pregnancy but the disease itself doesn’t manifest. To prevent Rh disease, if a mother in her second pregnancy has a fetus of opposite sign, RhIg is administered–an anti-Rh factor antibody that inhibits immune response [18, 19].</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">To conclude, neonatal isoerythrolysis can quickly become fatal to the neonate, but is perfectly preventable and treatable. Measures of prevention are particularly important, because neonates may begin nursing and absorbing antibodies that destroy red blood cells within hours of birth. Because the clinical signs of this disease are so severe, early detection is key to neonate survival. However, it is extremely easy to prevent this disease–a simple blood-type cross-match between a prospective father and mother will suffice. In the end, this is an issue of responsible breeding, thus conscientious breeders should not encounter Neonatal Isoerythrolysis at all.</span>
