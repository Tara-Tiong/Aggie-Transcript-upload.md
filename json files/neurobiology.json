I found it to be interesting because of its significance in the earliest stages of our lives. Further research into scientific literature discussing the role of pruning in neurodevelopment led me to learn more about its mechanism, distinctions from other forms of axon degrading, and its use in adult organisms.<br/>\n<span id=\"more-1882\"></span><br/>\n<h4>Introduction</h4>\nThe early developmental stages of the nervous system produce an excess of neural connections. In order to regulate developing circuitry, our nervous system has a set of functions grouped together known as axonal degeneration. Certain situations, such as neurodevelopment, learning, and injury, require the degradation of synaptic connections. However, these intricate deteriorations are not detrimental. It is important for these unnecessary links to be removed in order to promote basic functionality, organization, and neural plasticity.</p>\n<p>Axon degeneration first came to the attention of neuroscientists during studies of neurodevelopment and developmental plasticity. This latter term refers to structural changes made during early postnatal development, in response to the external environment and the amount of internal activity or stimulation. Historically, the most commonly used model in studying developmental plasticity is the ocular dominance column, which is found in the brain as part of the visual cortex. The basis for this model is thanks to a study published in 1963 by Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel, one that earned them the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1981. The two recorded neural activity in the visual cortex of kittens, which have similar structural features to the developing human child\u2019s brain. These recordings required inserting an electrode into the area of interest within the brain of the sedated kitten and listening to a crackle-like sound. The intensity of this sound depends on the frequency that neurons fire action potentials in response to visual stimulation the researchers presented to the anesthetized kittens. More specifically, the variations in intensity of sound demonstrated differences in how neurons responded to black versus white light.</p>\n<p>Following these trials, the pair found a particular orientation of light that covered the entirety of the neurons\u2019 range of vision. This demonstrated a way to develop a topographical map of the visually-processing part of the brain, and revealed that neurons within the visual cortex are systematically organized. The cells are grouped into ocular dominance columns, and eventually converge optic information to create a larger image that the rest of the brain can process binocularly. At the moment that neurons are activated in ocular dominance columns, they are providing monocular input, as sections of cells in these columns are segregated and respond only to input from one eye.</p>\n<p>Subsequent experiments have shown that manipulating the distribution of visual input during early postnatal phases can alter the visual cortex structurally and functionally. Plasticity is an essential component of the developing brain. There is a remarkable amount of synaptic growth, mostly in creating synaptic connections, that occurs over the first one or two years in the human brain. These initial connections are sometimes described as \u201cexperience-expectant,\u201d meaning that the developmental stage anticipates learning cues to fill the synaptic connections with information at a rapid pace. Learning requires physical space in the brain; therefore trimming undesirable synaptic connections can be beneficial. This is the essence of plasticity. In the visual cortex, these same principles can be applied to the ocular dominance columns amongst other groups of neurons. Varying and unusual stimulation of rods and cones in developing eyes, caused by excessive exposure to light or the lack of it, can cause permanent changes in the neural architecture of the visual cortex. Under-stimulated neurons that had an expected role will have their synaptic links degraded by pruning, disabling those neurons from firing for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Axon pruning plays an important role in neurodevelopment and even in neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the mechanism of pruning and its effects on cognitive function is both interesting and relevant to the goals of modern medicine.</p>\n<p><h4>Different Pathways of Axon Degeneration</h4>\nThe degradation of axons is observed through three different phenomena: Wallerian degeneration, axon apoptosis, and axon pruning. The first process, also called axotomy, is the process of degrading an axon by severing its ties to neighboring cells. Axon pruning and apoptosis have mechanistic similarities in how they are initiated through cell signaling and carried out using caspases, which are enzymes that degrade proteins and peptides. However, the main difference between the two mechanisms is in the types of caspases used to signal degradation. The different types of caspases cause the destruction of either the entire cell or just the axons. This distinction, among others still less clear to researchers, allows axon apoptosis to destroy the entire neuron, while axon pruning degrades targeted axon branches. Neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity, and injury recovery all utilize axon pruning as a means to redevelop, repair, and create more efficient pathways in the brain.</p>\n<p>There are several distinctions between apoptosis and pruning. Apoptosis is primarily used during early stages of life and development, but axon pruning becomes more prevalent in the adult stages when the neural circuitry is less flexible and requires more delicate changes. Along with having a significant qualitative difference in what and when they degrade, the two destructive processes are regulated separately and are the results of distinct pathways being activated. There are clear, observable differences following their completions, but the fact that pruning and apoptosis use the same proteins begs the question of how the nervous system selects one process without triggering the other. In 2013, Cusack et al. investigated the cellular distinctions of the two processes and their respective pathways. Although pruning and apoptosis share Bax, Caspase 9, and Caspase, their results suggest that there are other factors involved in each process that provide the mechanistic distinctions. Apoptosis requires Apaf-1(apoptotic protease activating factor 1), but pruning utilizes Caspase 6. There are still several areas of uncertainty in how exactly these factors interact. In one experiment, the group compared mature neurons to young neurons and their responses to complete NGF deprivation. Adult-stage neurons, which typically have more connections, were found to prevent apoptosis but allow for pruning. This suggests that synaptic plasticity is not as common in the adult brain, but does not mean that it is impossible. The maintenance of both processes into adulthood is critical, as it allows for learning but protects from degeneration due to age.</p>\n<p><h4>The Mechanism of Axon Pruning</h4>\nMost of our understanding of the mechanism of axon pruning comes from experiments triggering pruning in neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). This is done by isolating parts of the neuron from nerve growth factor (NGF). NGFs are critical proteins involved in promoting survival and growth for neurons. In studies where only the axon was subjected to NGF deprivation, axon pruning was initiated. During localized NGF deprivation, a signaling cascade places Dual Leucine Zipper Kinase (DLK) on the targeted axon, and the kinase signals the soma, the bulbous cell body of a neuron, to activate transcription factors that carry out pruning. C-Jun-N Terminal Kinases (JNKs) broadcast the DLK signal further. Although there are a growing amount of observations of the signaling and initiation of pruning, the mechanism of how pruning is executed is less understood.</p>\n<p>A recent study has shown that a protein called Puma is a restrictive mediator of pruning, as its presence keeps regions of the axon from localized NGF deprivation, which in turn protects those stretches from degradation. Interestingly, in addition to protecting regions of the axon from degradation, Puma has a potential role in directly activating a protein named Bax that carries out pruning. The movement of Bax into the mitochondrial membrane triggers the release of cytochrome C, which is thought to trigger the release of apoptotic factors such as Apaf-1 along with Caspase 9 and Caspase 3. These latter three degrading proteins are also featured in axon apoptosis, and have been observed to provide similar signal transductions and actions in axon pruning as they do in apoptosis. Localized degradation in axon pruning is the defining characterization which separates the process from total cell death by apoptosis.</p>\n<p><h4>Axon Pruning and Injury</h4>\nRecovery from injuries in the central nervous system (CNS) involves axonal regrowth that eventually leads to functional connections. Regrowth requires plasticity, but in order for this to take place, both aberrant and non-functional axons must be cleared from the circuitry. There is a gap in understanding the process of regeneration. Many current studies look to understand the reformation of synaptic connections as well as axon degradation as a whole. It is known that there are multiple potential impediments for axonal outgrowth in a given scenario, one of which could be unkempt nerve damage.</p>\n<p><h4>Further Research and Conclusions</h4>\nThe field of neuroscience works to expand on this incredibly interesting frontier. It is important to understand the mechanisms of neurons and their synaptic communication due to their role in most of our functionality and in forming the people that we are and know. Neurodevelopment, injury recovery, and learning are examples of the extent that axon pruning influences. Further research should continue to explore the role of neuronal degradation in these complex processes. Having a stronger command of how we recover from devastating injuries and how we create space for new synaptic connections would have a direct impact in improving lives. Continuing to uncover the processes of axon pruning and degradation provide hope for finding treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly involving learning and memory.</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aoki, Chiye and Erisir, Alev. \u201cChapter Thirteen \u2013 Experience-Dependent Synaptic Plasticity in the Developing Cerebral Cortex\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Synapse- Structure and Function</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

        "title": "Cause of Seizures in Individuals with Angelman Syndrome",
        "author": "Neha Madugala, Cognitive Science, \u201822",
        "date": "03/01/2019",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While browsing recent scientific achievements and breaking news in the scientific community, I came across an article declaring that the 125-year-old neuroscience mystery surrounding perineuronal nets (PNNs) is finally resolved. PNNs have stumped neuroscientists for decades, yet their importance is undeniable. To understand the extent of this discovery, I read more about PNNs and found that they have a key connection to Angelman syndrome, which causes severe epileptic seizures in children. The new findings from the Philpot Lab identifying the purpose of PNNs draw a connection between PNNs and seizures, and this information can lead to improved medications and therapeutic treatment methods. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1921\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The genetic disorder Angelman syndrome results in developmental and intellectual disabilities in children. Symptoms start to appear from the ages of six to twelve months with more severe symptoms, specifically epileptic seizures, occurring around the ages of two to three years old (1). Angelman syndrome is defined as the loss of function of the maternal UBE3A gene due to abnormal prenatal or postnatal development. Around 70% of cases are due to the deletion of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15 (1). Other cases are a result of a mutation in the maternal copy or, more rarely, a mutation being passed down by genetic inheritance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, scientists have observed that the neurons of people with Angelman syndrome have an abnormal amount of perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs were first identified in 1893 by Camillo Golgi (3). They consist of the extracellular matrix around the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of neurons. PNNs usually surround neurons of the Central Nervous System \u2013 the neurons of the brain and spinal cord (3). Over the past decade, it has been determined that PNNs play a critical role in neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, strokes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and epilepsy. Both the UBE3A gene and PNNs affect the rate of transmission of electrical signals in the brain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers are currently trying to decipher the exact role of the UBE3A gene and PNNs. They believe that PNNs may be an indicator of excitatory activity in the brain. By restoring the function of the maternal gene or activating the paternal gene, which is silenced in the parts of the brain affected by Angelman syndrome, researchers believe that they can predict and prevent epileptic seizures. Current efforts are focused on therapeutic treatment and enzyme inhibitors. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>UBE3A Gene</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While researching seizures in individuals with Angelman syndrome, a team of scientists from the Philpot Lab at UNC School of Medicine investigated gene therapy as a potential solution. The study used a mouse model and inserted a dormant UBE3A gene into the mouse\u2019s brain that can be activated by chemical signals. The goal of the study was to test if improvements could be seen in individuals with Angelman syndrome if the UBE3A gene was repaired after birth. If the gene is restorable, then Angelman syndrome could be curable if caught quickly enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gu et al. found that restoration of a working gene could prevent epileptic seizures if turned on at the age of three weeks, but resulted in no improvement in adult mice. Three weeks of a mouse\u2019s lifetime equates to the early childhood of a human, which suggests that there is a significant chance that Angelman syndrome can be reversed if treated early enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gu et al. wanted to further test if the gene needed to be restored in all types of neurons. They first tried removing the UBE3A gene from only excitatory genes and found that the absence of the gene from only these neurons did not result in seizures. Furthermore, when they removed the UBE3A gene only from inhibitory neurons, they observed more seizures than if the UBE3A gene was missing from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since the UBE3A gene is correlated to neurons firing faster, these results suggest that the main role of the UBE3A gene is to ensure that the inhibitory neurons fire faster than the excitatory neurons. Without the UBE3A gene in inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons continue to send electrical signals after a message has been sent because the inhibitory neurons are unable to fire fast enough to stop the excitatory neurons\u2019 signals. Therefore, scientists primarily need to repair the gene in inhibitory neurons, so these neurons are able to fire quickly enough to prevent excess electrical activity. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Perineuronal Nets</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During their experiments, the Philpot lab team found an abnormal accumulation of PNNs in the hippocampus of individuals affected by Angelman syndrome. This accumulation of PNNs did not occur in the hippocampus of individuals without this disorder. Gu et al. determined that these distinct structures act as biomarkers for \u201cenhanced seizure susceptibility.\u201d Furthering these findings, Sontheimer et al. at Virginia Tech looked at the role of PNNs in preventing seizures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In their study, Sontheimer et al. used a mouse model with glioblastoma, or brain cancer, to test which features of brain cancer lead to seizures. They found two key aspects that led to seizures: the neurotransmitter glutamate and the enzyme MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase). Glioblastoma is typically restricted by the size of the skull, but glutamate and MMP help create space for the highly-metastasizing cancer to continue to spread (5). The team suspected that these two features may directly affect the PNNs, which in turn results in seizures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Glutamate kills cells around the tumor to create more space for the tumor to spread. Interestingly, glutamate targets cells that have the UBE3A gene and produce the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which lowers membrane capacitance, or the ability to store electrical charge and as a result send electrical signals quickly (5). GABA is typically found in inhibitory neurons, which stop the firing of neurons after a message has already been relayed. GABA helps prevent excess electrical impulses, which in turn can prevent a seizure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Glioblastoma also secretes the enzyme MMP, which dissolves the PNNs (5). Sontheimer et al. conducted an experiment where only the enzyme MMP was added to a healthy brain. The team found that the loss of the PNNs resulted in seizures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PNNs, found mainly on inhibitory neurons, prevent excess electrical impulses after a message has been relayed by releasing the neurotransmitter GABA, lowering the membrane capacitance. If the PNNs are missing from GABA-releasing neurons, electrical impulses will not be inhibited fast enough. Therefore, there will be excess electrical impulses leading to sudden surges of electrical activity, or seizures. These results suggest that a potential treatment could be an enzyme inhibitor, but more research is needed to fully back this medication. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, these findings directly correlate to the findings of Gu et al. who found that more seizures occurred when the UBE3A gene is missing from inhibitory neurons. This suggests that both PNNs and the UBE3A gene are essential in preventing excess electrical activity. Since people with Angelman syndrome are only missing the UBE3A gene but still get seizures, it has been suggested that both the gene and PNNs must be present in order to prevent seizures. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Angelman syndrome consists of two major factors: the presence of the UBE3A gene and PNNs. Gu et al. found that Angelman syndrome could be reverted if the gene was activated during early childhood. Furthermore, the Philpot lab study suggests that seizures, in general, may be correlated to PNNs. These findings are crucial for further research on preventing epileptic seizures for other neurological disorders, in addition to Angelman syndrome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For both Angelman syndrome and glioblastoma, the neurons that release the neurotransmitter GABA are responsible for preventing seizures. For Angelman syndrome, the UBE3A gene in the inhibitory neurons is mutated, and for glioblastoma, the PNNs are dissolved. These findings suggest that both the gene and nets are necessary for preventing excess excitatory activity. Further experimentation is needed to support these claims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These findings not only have the potential to revert Angelman syndrome, but they also may help prevent one of the most severe symptoms of a multitude of neurological disorders: epileptic seizures. Findings like these can help uncover more about how the brain works and also help improve the quality of life for those with neurological disorders.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAngelman syndrome \u2013 Genetics Home Reference \u2013 NIH.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">U.S. National Library of Medicine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, National Institutes of Health, ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/angelman-syndrome.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ives, James. \u201cGenetic Therapy May Help Children with Angelman syndrome to Overcome Seizures.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">News-Medical.net</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, News Medical, 21 Nov. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.news-medical.net/news/20181121/Genetic-therapy-may-help-children-with-Angelman-syndrome-to-overcome-seizures.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.news-medical.net/news/20181121/Genetic-therapy-may-help-children-with-Angelman-syndrome-to-overcome-seizures.aspx</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPerineuronal Net.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NeuroImage</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Academic Press, </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/perineuronal-net\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/perineuronal-net</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPerineuronal Nets and Epilepsy | Neuroscience.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LabRoots</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, LabRoots, Inc., </span><a href=\"http://www.labroots.com/trending/neuroscience/13240/perineuronal-nets-epilepsy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.labroots.com/trending/neuroscience/13240/perineuronal-nets-epilepsy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cScientists Solve Century-Old Neuroscience Mystery; Answers May Lead to Epilepsy Treatment.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ScienceDaily</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, ScienceDaily, 9 Nov. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181109073036.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181109073036.htm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSolving a Century-Old Neuroscience Puzzle May Lead to Epilepsy Therapy.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">FierceBiotech</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, 9 Nov. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/solving-a-century-old-neuroscience-puzzle-may-lead-to-epilepsy-therapy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.fiercebiotech.com/research/solving-a-century-old-neuroscience-puzzle-may-lead-to-epilepsy-therapy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">UNC_Health_Care. \u201cCan Genetic Therapy Help Kids with Angelman syndrome Overcome Seizures?\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">EurekAlert!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/uonc-cgt112018.php.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

The assignment was to choose a clinically-relevant topic, review the existing body of literature on this topic, and choose a specific area to write on. My topic of interest was about the relationship between gut microbiome and the brain. I became interested in this topic after reading an article about the differences between the microbial composition of individuals with depression. By the end of the quarter, my research question evolved from \u201chow does our diet affect our brain or mood?\u201d to \u201chow does modulation of gut microbiome affect depression pathophysiology?\u201d I enjoyed the flexibility of the assignment, and I greatly benefited from the guidance provided by Dr. Sperber. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in health-related fields, especially in research!</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2083\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Depression is a stress-related disorder affecting more than 350 million people and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (1).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Development of depression is strongly correlated with the prognosis of chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma, and heart diseases (2).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed class of medications for depression (3). However, 30% of patients develop resistance to treatment over time, and more than 68% of patients discontinue the use after 3 months due to lack of improvement or development of adverse effects (3, 4). The exact mechanism of SSRIs is not fully understood, which is limiting researchers from adequately addressing these problems (4). Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of depression is crucial to developing more effective treatments (1). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The gut-brain axis is a topic of growing discussion that can provide means for depression treatment (5).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract regulated by the gut microbiome (5). The gut microbiome plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many physiological and psychological disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (5), autism spectrum disorder (6),</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Parkinson\u2019s disease (7), and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">depression (5)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Microbiome composition is influenced by genetics, use of antibiotics, smoking habits, diet, and age, and disruption of microbial composition inducing changes in behavior and mood (9,10). Gut-brain interactions occur through the neuroendocrine, nervous, and immune systems (9). However, the mechanism through which microbiome affects depression status is unclear (11). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this review, I will provide a comprehensive overview of the three pathways involved in the gut-brain axis: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis pathway involving the neuroendocrine system, the cytokines pathway involving the immune system, and the neurotransmitter pathways involving the nervous system. Then, I will describe how microbiome modulation affects these pathways and consequently depression symptoms. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Hpa Axis</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The HPA axis is hyperactive in 40-60% of patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (14). It is the central reactivity response system in the brain (12). Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin (VAP) are normally released from the hypothalamus, which subsequently trigger the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. In response to ACTH, glucocorticoids, like cortisol, are released from the adrenal cortex to regulate immunity, metabolism, and mood (13).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The hyperactivity of HPA is indicated by three markers: 1) enlargement of the pituitary and adrenal glands, 2) elevated CRH levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, and 3) elevated glucocorticoids levels in plasma, saliva, and urine (15).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sudo et al. used germ-free mice to test the effects of microbiome on the HPA axis (16). Germ-free mice had significantly higher responses to stress compared to control as indicated by the elevated levels of ACTH and corticosterone (16). However, the introduction of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bifidobacterium infantis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a common bacterial species usually found in the guts of most mammals, restored the normal levels (16). Interestingly, childhood traumatic life events like physical or sexual abuse are also associated with higher cortisol release accompanied by alteration in fecal microbiota (17, 18). This demonstrates a top-down relationship in which the brain indirectly influences the gut, thus corroborating the bidirectionality of the gut-brain axis (13).</span></p>\n<p><h4>Cytokines</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Depression is associated with the hyperactivation of the immune system, indicated by overproduction of immune cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines (19).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pro-inflammatory cytokines are biomarkers usually elevated during infection and inflammation (20).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">C</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ytokines like TNF-a and IL-6 are found at levels significantly higher in depressed individuals (19, 21)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A recent study investigated the causal relationship between depression and cytokines levels (8). First, stress was induced to mice using the Maternal Separation model, a standardized method to study mental health in rodents where a brief maternal absence in early life significantly alters behavior (8). Then, depression levels were assessed using the Forced Swim Test, a method to study depression in rodents (22). In this test, development of depression is indicated by 1) increased immobility and 2) increased swimming time (22). Mice that were exposed to early maternal separation exhibited higher depression-like behavior, which triggered the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (8). To measure the effects of probiotics on cytokines levels, the study administered </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bifidobacteria infantis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to depressed mice, then compared it to a group treated with Citalopram, an antidepressant (8). After chronic probiotic treatment, decreased immobility in the Forced Swim Test and restoration of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels were observed with effects comparable to Citalopram (8). </span></p>\n<p><h4>Neurotransmitters</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Serotonin </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The monoamine hypothesis is the most accepted model for pathogenesis of depression (23). It states that depression is caused by deficiency in neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which have been major targets for most antidepressants (23). A study by Wikoff et al. tested a possible mechanism by which gut microbiome modulation influences serotonin levels in germ-free mice (24). The introduction of microbiome increased plasma serotonin levels </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.8 fold (24).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This increase may be attributed to the regulatory effects of microbiome on the serotonin that is usually stored in gut tissues upon birth (25). However, more studies are needed to determine the mechanism of release.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GABA</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating the central nervous system (26). A reduction or an increase in GABA receptors is correlated with depression (26). To observe the effects of gut microbiome on GABA receptors and depression-like behavior, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lactobacillus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bifidobacterium </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bacterial strains were fed to two groups of stress-induced mice (27). The first group was only stress-induced, while the second group was stress-induced and vagotomized, which refers to cutting part or all of the vagus nerve (27). The first group had altered GABA receptor expression and reduced depression-like behavior after probiotics administration as observed using the Forced Swim Test (27).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The vagotomized mice, however, did not exhibit the same effects (27). This suggests that the vagus nerve is a possible way of interaction between the brain and the gut microbiome (27). This study did not use germ-free mice or mice with modified gut microbiome, which makes it more applicable to free-living mammals, including humans (27).</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This review investigated possible pathways by which the microbiome affects depression status in mice. Such pathways involve the HPA axis, cytokines, serotonin, and GABA. The findings can be utilized to develop medications specifically targeting depression markers in the gut or to further investigate the possible antidepressant properties of probiotics, which can be included in parallel with standard depression therapy. More studies on this topic are necessary to understand how these pathways relate to the etiology of depression in humans.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Forsythe P, Sudo N, Dinan T, Taylor VH, Bienenstock J.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While working on a different paper, I became interested in treatment and therapy for drug addiction. Addiction continues to increase, yet there seem to be limited viable options to actually overcome this problem. One of the main issues in the recovery process is relapses. I found this study interesting and promising for drug therapy because it directly targets relapses, an important step in preventing and treating drug addiction more effectively.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2179\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In order to reduce the rate of addiction, scientists are trying to figure out how to prevent relapses after an individual has decided to stop using a specific drug. One of the major factors in preventing relapses is breaking detrimental environmental connections that may trigger an individual to start using a certain drug again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A study by Torregrossa at the University Pittsburgh School of Medicine identified the brain circuit involved in cue-associated memories. They were able to establish that synaptic connections between the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and the lateral amygdala (LA) were strengthened with increased cocaine usage (3). Furthermore, they found that by weakening the synaptic connections in the MGN-LA circuit, they were able to erase the cocaine-cue memories and in turn help reduce relapses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MGN is a group of subnuclei located in the thalamus that receive auditory input, which it then conveys to the auditory cortex (4). The LA is an important component to conditioning experiments, like Torregrossa\u2019s experiment. Though the LA is usually associated with experiments that use fear-inducing stimuli, Torregrossa uses a more desirable incentive: the cocaine high. It also believed that the LA is a key site of plasticity, which means it establishes long-lasting changes while learning these cues and also helps store cue-associated memories (6). Based on these findings, Torregrossa developed an experiment that reflected the role of both the MGN and the LA in the circuit to test whether the link between a cue and a certain situation could be altered. She used the scope of drug addiction to see if relapses triggered by cue-associated memories could be prevented by erasing the link between the cue and memory. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The researchers placed the rats in a cage with a lever, which connected to a pump that intravenously dispensed a dose of cocaine into the rat\u2019s bloodstream. Every time the rat pressed the lever, it was given a dose of cocaine, which was accompanied by a bright light and a ringing noise for ten seconds (7). The goal was to establish an audiovisual cue with the high felt from cocaine. By creating this connection, Torregrossa would be able to simply play the audiovisual cue and stimulate a craving for the cocaine high, even when no cocaine was being dispensed from the lever. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The creation of the audiovisual cue strengthened the synaptic connections in the MGN-LA circuit, establishing a starting point for Torregrossa to determine whether these strengthened connections could be diminished or altered in some form. The goal of the experiment was to weaken these connections in order to break the linkage between the established audiovisual cue and the cocaine high. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In order to weaken the connections, Torregrossa used optogenetics, a technique to introduce light-sensitive genes into targeted brain cells in order to control brain activity using light signals (8). Optogenetics essentially introduces genetically modified neurons, achieved through the insertion of light-sensitive proteins into the targeted neurons, which create ion channels among the genetically modified neurons. Through the use of a specific type of light, for this experiment \u2013 blue LED laser light, researchers are able to stimulate the light-sensitive ion channels on command (8). This techniques have been utilized in previous experiments with mice where researchers were able to stop epileptic seizures or induce thirst on command (7). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Light stimulation must take place in the region, which is activated when new memories are made (2). Furthermore, Torregrossa et al. observed that the memory of the cocaine high as a result of the audiovisual cue led to heightened activity in the rat\u2019s amygdala, which is located in the medial temporal lobe and is crucial in processing emotions such as fear and pleasure (1). As a result, Torregrossa identified the amygdala to be a key site in weakening the connection between the cue and the high. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She determined that the sensory intersection in the amygdala would be the ideal site to place the electrode, given that it is directly associated with the cue-triggered memories. The electrode inserts light-sensitive proteins into the targeted neurons. Therefore, these electrodes enable the blue LED laser light to control the neurons (3). For this experiment, the light can dampen the drug cue. After using the light stimulation for fifteen minutes, they conducted a test to determine any changes in the strength of the synaptic connections. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By reducing the extent of the drug cue, the mice essentially forgot the link between the audiovisual cue and the cocaine high (7). In addition to the optogenetics method, Torregrossa initially used exposure therapies. The goal of exposure therapy is in line with Torregrossa\u2019s intent to break the link between the cue and source of addiction. However, exposure therapy involves exposing the mice to the audiovisual cue without the cocaine high a significant number of times, so they in turn do not associate the cue with the high. While this method may be temporarily effective, once the environment changes, researchers have observed that the connection between the cue and source of addiction returns (3). While both exposure therapy and the optogenetics method were successful in reducing relapses, the optogenetic method was more effective in terms of accuracy and long-term results (3). \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The possibility of erasing cue-associated memories has the potential to help prevent relapses and improve therapy and treatment for addiction. By establishing the amygdala as a key site of where these connections are produced, researchers will be able to conduct further studies looking at what other parts of the brain are involved in the creation of these memories.

        "date": "05/24/2019",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Like everyone else, I love music- especially the works of my favorite artists. There is nothing better than listening or jamming out to your favorite song. The human love for music is a powerful binding force, but why do we even like it? What are the underlying physiological responses of our enjoyment? I wanted to explore the functions of our brain as they relate to enjoying music, and found some interesting results about what scientists have uncovered thus far.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most distinguishing characteristics of the human brain is the ability to interpret and feel emotions regarding complex environmental stimuli such as visual arts and music. Even more interesting is the seemingly infinite amount of variation in how each individual perceives these stimuli, or rather, the reason why one person may love to listen to Vampire Weekend while another casually listens to a lo-fi playlist. There are structural similarities shared by all humans, crafted over millions of years of evolution, but they do not account for different tastes. Neuroscientists who study dopaminergic pathways and other neural structural mechanisms have made several initial steps in understanding what physiological functions music serves to humans. So far, it has been established that musical appreciation and preference are related to the connectivity of white matter between regions in the auditory cortex and the regions processing emotion; variations in activity from neurons related to emotional communication could explain our differences in musical taste. Answering questions about the effects of music on the brain will undoubtedly help to answer larger questions about music\u2019s evolutionary purpose and its profound impact on human cultures. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Neuroscience of Pleasure and Reward</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Motivation, emotion, and arousal can all be attributed to elevated activity in the reward centers of the brain. As these traits are known to have implications in addiction, their cellular manifestations have been studied for several decades. The ventral striatum, midbrain, amygdala, and some areas of the prefrontal cortex have all been demonstrated, in varying degrees, to being recruited in instances of drug use. The dopaminergic pathways of the brain refer to a series of densely-packed neuronal connections that are stimulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine to propagate signals. Collectively, these regions of the brain are responsible for our response to natural stimuli and our actions to either seek or avoid them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The brain\u2019s reward centers are also known to be active in communal interactions, suggesting that there is a benefit to acting in a socially-positive way. Interestingly, the emotions experienced by humans when listening to their favorite music is correlated to the engagement of the same dopaminergic pathways as those that are stimulated during drug use or social interactions. It is important to note that the similarities between which parts of the brain are engaged when listening to music, using drugs, or being with people do not imply that the physiological or psychological effects are closely mimicked in the process. Neurons communicate via action potentials. These synaptic changes in membrane voltage effectively signal messages to neighboring neurons, but nothing about them is inherently meaningful. Since all action potentials are the same, it is the frequency of their appearances that convey messages. As it relates to the similarities in regions activated by both drug use and music, increases in activity do not necessarily equal the same frequencies of action potentials. Nonetheless, positron emission tomography (PET) scans observing pleasurable responses to music in animals and humans show the same regions of the brain being activated. Increases in dopaminergic pathway activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral pallidum, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, hippocampus, and other areas of the midbrain collectively correlate to the reward process [3]. </span></p>\n<p><h4>The Brain\u2019s Response to Music</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are several experiments that examine the neural response to music, or \u201caesthetic responses\u201d as some scientific literature has described. PET studies visualized the neural relationship with \u2018intensely pleasurable\u2019 responses to music [2]. Intensely pleasurable responses are defined as euphoric sensations in reaction to music, characterized by \u201cshivers-down-the-spine\u201d or \u201cchills\u201d [1]. In addition to observing activity levels within the brain, researchers monitored heart rate and blood flow in the brain. When excited by external stimuli, the central nervous system commands a response throughout the body to heighten the senses and increase awareness. A study by Blood et al. measured heart rate and cerebral blood flow of subjects listening to chill-inducing songs. Increases in the intensity of stimulation from a song were shown to increase blood flow in areas of the brain\u2019s reward centers, as well as the heart rate. It is known that pleasure derived from music activates regions between the brain\u2019s auditory region, specifically the superior temporal gyrus, and the reward centers such as the ventral and dorsal striatum. Parts of the basal ganglia, the ventral and dorsal striatum are largely responsible for motor function as it relates to desire and reward. Despite these findings, the exact connection between physiological sensations and aesthetic responses in the brain are ambiguous [1]. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Evolutionary Advantage?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The question of music\u2019s evolutionary purpose has been postulated for over a century, including in Darwin\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [3]. To some experts, music is considered to be the result of an evolutionary exaptation. That is, music\u2019s purpose was not selected for its current use by humans. Rather, it came about as a result of excited neural pathways that engage emotional responses [1]. Others suggest that music is an important communicative tool that possibly preceded speech and language [5]. In this case, the chills elicited by music are physiologically measurable emotional responses, which signify that music is effectively a resource for communicating emotions [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Based on this idea, some researchers wanted to examine responses to music between individuals and compare them to the structural foundations of their emotional expressiveness capacity. Musical anhedonia is used to describe a condition for those who do not exhibit any pleasure from music, as there is no dopaminergic response from the reward centers. The flat affective response of individuals with this condition could be compared to the brains of subjects with affective responses to music. One such study found that patterns of white matter networks between the superior temporal gyrus through the ventral and dorsal striatum predicted the amount of reward response elicited by music. As the name suggests, the superior temporal gyrus is part of the temporal lobe- which is associated with the auditory cortex. This path of white matter moves from the auditory processing system to the basal ganglia. The aforementioned ventral and dorsal striatum, both parts of the basal ganglia, are involved in motor function. However, there could be other reward-related responses elicited from these structures, such as chills. Some researchers postulate that music may have had its origins from chill-responses to pleasurable sounds in the evolutionary environment, which may have motivated our ancestors to create their own response-evoking sounds [3]. Chills are viewed as a form of communication, demonstrating a positive response to sounds. Therefore, finding this white matter network may suggest that, in addition to emotion, there is a structural aspect of music involved in communication [3].</span></p>\n<p><h4>Music\u2019s Effect on Other Species</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A less studied and even less understood aspect of music is its meaning and interpretation by other species. Understanding the effect of music on other animals could provide a glimpse into music\u2019s inherent biological meaning. Although it is clear that the pleasures that humans experience from music are not necessarily akin to the experience of animals, research suggests that music genres can affect the mood or behavior of captive animals. Country music has been shown to improve the mood and well-being of cattle, as opposed to more harsh or erratic-sounding music such as rock and jazz. One study specifically showed that cows more readily entered milking parlours when exposed to country music. However, these foundational animal studies have strictly been observant of the behavior and activity of the cattle [4]. Examining the neurological differences in musical preference or indifference in cattle would provide more concrete evidence of the neurological change that leads to the observed behaviors.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Further Discussions and Research</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The research discussed thus far provides clues into the baseline purposes of music and the nature of its evolutionary impact. Yet, there are still many interesting existential discussion topics surrounding the origins of music and its purpose. Grounded biological inquiry, however, will be the most essential tool to get closer to understanding the extraordinary impact of music on human culture, communication, and evolution. Moving forward, researchers should continue to address the differences between individual preference and capacity to respond to music by studying differences in neural matter and structure. Most evidence suggests that music has a strong correlation to emotional expression, so examining the mechanisms of communication and interpreting abstract stimuli as emotional cues will help researchers understand how music can be physiologically deciphered and responded to. On a broader scale, examining global differences in musicality could provide insight into how different cultures and languages relate to their historically popular forms of music and rhythms. Could phonetic or rhythmic patterns in language correspond to preferences for certain tempos, measures, rhythms, or lyrics in music? These questions would be better served in a separate discussion but for now, go back to enjoying your favorite song.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blood, A.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4> While browsing recent findings in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neuroscience</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, I came across research investigating the possible conversion of glia to neurons. Although the conventional idea that neurons are irreplaceable has been overturned in multiple research studies, I was immediately intrigued by the possibility for neighboring glia to be the source of neural regeneration. The implications of this research could completely transform how treatment is approached in the neuroscience field of medicine.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2377\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The trademark of neural cells is their inability to regenerate, which makes each individual neuron subject to potentially irreversible damage. However, glia, cells that support and protect neurons, possess the ability to mitotically divide. Traditionally, glia were believed to play a secondary role to neurons, acting as supporting cells. This initial assumption is validated by the inability of glia to conduct synaptic interactions and electrical impulses like their neuronal partners (1). However, upon further investigation, it has been discovered that glia possess various qualities that render them equally, if not more, significant than neurons themselves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A popular and widely accepted belief in neuroscience is the assumption that glia outnumber neurons in a nearly ten-to-one ratio. This notion was recently challenged in a study conducted by Barthheld et al. in 2016. They found that through the use of a new counting method, the isotropic fractionator, the glia-to-neuron ratio was closer to one-to-one (2).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The isotropic fractionator method departs from the traditional stereological technique of estimating cell numbers. Previously, cell counting was limited to well defined structures, excluding large neural regions of the brain that exhibit anisotropy \u2013 a tendency of some structures to exhibit different properties in different directions. This property is seen in aluminum, an anisotropic material where light reflects off the aluminum in different ways depending on the angle of light shone upon it. The isotropic fractionator transforms these highly anisotropic regions of the brain to isotropic, or homogeneous, suspensions of cell nuclei that can be easily counted (3). The use of this method led to the discovery of a one-to-one ratio of glia and neurons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite their unexpectedly low cell count, glia continue to perform regularly in the regulation of neural repair. In the nervous system, there are two major types of glia: Schwann cells and astrocytes. Each type of glia operates within a subdivision of the nervous system and accordingly utilize different methods of neural repair. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Glia in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), or Schwann cells, are known to regress to an earlier stage after an injury. This stimulates axonal regrowth</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> via an upregulation of growth-related genes, resulting in remyelination \u2013 a feature unique to the PNS (4). Conversely, glia in the central nervous system (CNS), or astrocytes, suppress neural repair and form a \u201cglial scar.\u201d While the specific reasons for the differences in repair have yet to be elucidated, the primary intent of maintaining and protecting neurons remains the same.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Intrigued by the natural regenerative tendency of glial cells, a Penn State research team led by Dr. Gong Chen has been conducting research investigating the possibility of converting glia, specifically astrocytes, \u00a0that surround dead neurons into new neurons. This conversion is intended to be the best way to restore lost neural function. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This began with the use of the NeuroD1 protein, a neural transcription factor which, when inserted, could switch on neural genes in glia that were silenced during early brain development. The protein simultaneously switches off glial genes, turning the glial cell into a functional neuron (5). However, research has not investigated the fate of the remaining glia post-conversion, leaving some uncertainty about this novel method continually in revision. This method is unique because it has proven successful after neurons have died, shifting from the initial focus of saving dying neurons.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Previous research using the NeuroD1 protein has successfully converted glia to working neurons via a gene therapy method. Gene therapy works through the use of a vector that carries the favored gene. As viruses have evolved to be successful in penetrating the host genome, they are often used in gene therapy as the vector. The infectious part of a virus, however, is removed and causes no harm to the patient. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the success of this method, the excessive cost of gene therapy treatment, sometimes reaching millions of dollars for a single patient, has isolated the large majority of those seeking affordable treatment for brain-related injuries. But a new method, pioneered by the same research team at Penn State that initially proposed the use of the NeuroD1 protein, has discovered an alternative method to expensive gene therapy, suggesting a drug therapy method instead. This drug therapy involves the chemical synthesis of four critical molecules discovered by Chen\u2019s team and packages it into a single pill that can be orally ingested by the patient. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Research into a drug therapy alternative began with the discovery of nine small molecules. However, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the intricacy of the specific sequence required to convert glia into neural cells stunted its transition to clinical treatment. The discovery by Chen\u2019s team proposes a new method to expedite this process, ne</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cessitating the use of only four molecules. Jiu-Chao Yin, a biology graduate student on Chen\u2019s research team, was responsible for the identification of these four molecules. He describes that the combination of these molecules modulate chemical signaling pathways, resulting in their ability to convert nearly 70 percent of astrocytes into functional neurons (5). These glial cells, initially unable to conduct electrical signaling, have shown the ability to transmit electrical signals to each other four months post-culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The discovery of this streamlined drug therapy could potentially be used to treat various neural-related medical conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease (6). Chen et al. are currently working to resolve technical issues regarding drug delivery as well as investigating potential side effects of the drug. This new method shows promise in both efficiency and cost while possessing the potential for large distribution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This discovery may revolutionize regenerative medicine as it further discredits the widely accepted belief that once damaged neurons are incapable of regenerating. The research done by Chen et al. suggests that the secret to neural repair could lie in glial cells, whose potential and many applications we are only just beginning to unveil.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Purves, D.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Previous studies in neuroscience have suggested that our expectations and prior experiences impact how we perceive reality and current tasks. This idea is embedded in Bayesian integration, also referred to as multisensory integration, which essentially studies how the brain combines information obtained from sensory neurons to affect perception and create a distinct outlook on an organism\u2019s surroundings. It defines how we view and think about our environment.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This topic was particularly interesting to me because expectations can serve to aid our further understanding of incoming information, but can also inhibit our understanding if the new information contradicts our predictions.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scientists classify expectations as essentially creating a placebo effect. The idea is that an individual\u2019s expectations can influence the outcome of a certain treatment, their personal performance, or their feelings towards a person, place, or object. These \u201cprior beliefs\u201d can shape our reality and influence our perception of things we encounter in our daily life. The source of this placebo is argued to either be due to a conditioned response, where a situation has occurred multiple times with the same outcome (behaviorist approach) or that the placebo is a result of expectancy (expectation approach) (4).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a recent study by MIT, researchers argued for the latter hypothesis suggesting that expectations are the suspect for shaping our interpretation of our surrounding environment. MIT neuroscientists were inspired by the idea of Bayesian integration, which is the process of incorporating prior knowledge with new and uncertain information (6). Jazayeri et al. trained monkeys in a task called \u201cready-set-go.\u201d The monkeys are shown a starting signal and ending signal. After seeing both signals, they are expected to press a button after the same time interval between the starting and ending code has passed (6). The neuroscientists had short intervals, which spanned from 480 to 800 milliseconds and long intervals, which were 800 to 1,200 milliseconds. The monkeys were given a visual cue at the start of each trial signalling whether the trial would be a \u201cshort\u201d or \u201clong\u201d scenario (6).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Monkeys were trained in either the short or long intervals. Each prior condition consisted of four blocks and then was followed by the 800 msec block. When all the monkeys were given an interval of 800 msec, those trained with a shorter interval gave an average response that was a little less than 800 msec and those trained with a longer interval gave an average response that was a little longer than 800 msec (6). These results reveal that monkeys trained under longer time intervals had an expectation for the 800 msec time interval to be longer, and those trained under a shorter time interval had an expectation that the 800 msec time interval would be shorter. This experiment was reproduced in humans and they found similar results (6).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MIT researchers wanted to further determine which areas of the brain are responsible for the influence of expectations from the short and long trials affected the perception of the length of time for the 800 msce interval. Jazayeri et al, found that prior experiences strengthen a pattern of synaptic connections in a region located in the frontal cortex, which has previously been determined to be involved in temporal resolution (6). These patterns of synaptic connections were further computationally modeled. These models were found to perform the tasks in the same manner as the monkeys used in the previous experiments.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In another study at the University of Wisconsin, researchers conducted a similar study in humans testing how prior expectations of taste can influence an individual\u2019s perception of the taste. Sarinopoulos et al. tested how subjects responded to an aversive taste, which was a diluted solution of quinine hydrochloride, with deceiving and accurate cues to test how placebo altered the participants\u2019 responses. One group was informed that they were about to receive a highly aversive taste, while the other group was deceived and told they would receive a less aversive taste. The group told that they would receive a less aversive taste acted as the experimental group and were used to test whether placebo is altered by expectations or further stated if expectations affect our perception. Sarinopoulos et al. compared the expectancy effect from the highly aversive to less aversive groups by measuring changes in the insula and the amygdala, which are activated by aversive tastes (5).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The insula is associated with pain processing, which explains the presence of many sensory receptors for visceroceptive, referring to signals received from the heart, lungs, stomach, bladder, and other internal organs near the trunk region, and interoceptive inputs, including regions of the brain such as the thalamus, brainstem, insula, somatosensory, and anterior cingulate cortex (2). The amygdala, located near the insula, specifically the medial temporal lobe forms a part of the limbic system and plays a fundamental role in emotion processing, specifically fear and pleasure (1).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The study was conducted using rapid event-related fMRI design. In order to create a basis of comparison, the study included various conditions with different levels of aversion and manipulation \u2013 totaling to seven experimental conditions. The wide array of conditions allows Sarinopoulos et al. to eliminate differences if the perception involves a more aversive or less aversive taste by including both aversive and pleasant taste with varying perceptions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2530\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"258\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed-300x258.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed-230x198.png 230w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed-300x258.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed-350x301.png 350w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed-480x413.png 480w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed-768x661.png 768w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed-830x715.png 830w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed-1024x882.png 1024w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/01/unnamed.png 1326w\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They found that subjects demonstrated a consistent pattern of rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), which plays an important role in decision-making and attention, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is also involved in decision-making, activation when presented with the misleading cue, followed by a decrease in the bilateral insula responses to the highly aversive taste. It was also associated with a smaller amygdala response. These findings suggest that the rACC and OFC are both correlated with the placebo effect and are associated with the aversive and pleasant perception of taste.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAmygdala.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ScienceDaily</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, ScienceDaily, </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/amygdala.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.sciencedaily.com/terms/amygdala.htm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">D.P.Papoiu, Alexandru. \u201cFunctional MRI Advances to Reveal the Hidden Networks Behind the Cerebral Processing of Itch.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ScienceDirect</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Academic Press, 5 Aug. 2016, </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128028384000285\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128028384000285</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cFigure 2f from: Irimia R, Gottschling M (2016) Taxonomic Revision of Rochefortia Sw.

I will look at a specific case of cerebral palsy\u2014my brother\u2014and talk about how his condition came to be and the likely prognosis. I want to delve into the details of how family dynamics play a very important role in the caregiving and caretaking that goes along with having a disabled family member and how that is seen in the relationship between my brother and my mother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I see two different perspectives of my brother, Sam, and his condition, cerebral palsy: one through his eyes and the other through the eyes of my mother, his caregiver. Observing how my mother has taken care of Sam from the beginning, I began to realize that it takes a lot to be a caregiver and that she plays a significant role in his life. In order to gain more insight into her practices of giving care, I interviewed her. I started off by asking her what it means to be a caregiver and what \u201ccare\u201d means to her. She took a deep breath in and expressed her daily routines as a caregiver. \u201cWaking up in the morning, the first thing that you have to do is to attend to him and care for him before yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that from brushing his teeth to giving him a shower and feeding him, we have to do everything from A to Z.\u201d[</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0A day in the life of my mother starts and ends with my brother, from getting him out of bed to providing him with basic needs like food and water. She even takes care of specific requests that pertain to his own interests, such as wearing a watch every day and having matching socks and pants.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder. Most cases of cerebral palsy occur under hypoxic conditions during the birthing process. This lack of oxygen to the brain can cause developmental delays and lifelong debilitating conditions [2]. My family and I have experienced the difficulties and limitations that accompany this disease first hand. My brother\u2019s condition of cerebral palsy is in its most extreme form: he has quadriplegia </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> spasticity. A telltale sign of quadriplegic cerebral palsy is the inability to voluntarily control and use the extremities. Spasticity occurs due to a lesion in the upper motor neuron, located in the brain and spinal cord. It interferes with the signals that your muscles need to move and manifests in the body by increasing muscle tone and making the muscles unusually tight [3]. Dr. Neil Lava, a member of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and American Academy of Neurology, describes the pathophysiology of a lack of muscular activity. \u201cWhen your muscles don\u2019t move for a long time, they become weak and stiff,\u201d Lava writes [4]. This physical restraint is evident in my brother\u2019s case because he has been wheelchair-bound since the age of seven.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2976 alignright\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"168\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-300x168.jpg\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-230x129.jpg 230w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-300x168.jpg 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-350x196.jpg 350w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-480x269.jpg 480w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-768x431.jpg 768w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-830x465.jpg 830w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/04/unnamed.jpg 1600w\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Upper motor neuron lesions can worsen over time. Major prolonged symptoms include over-responsive reflexes, weakness in the extensor muscles, and slow movement of the body, all of which affect the sensation of balance and coordination. For this kind of condition, occupational and physical therapy can alleviate some of the symptomatic stresses. In the case of therapy, performing the right kind of stretches can help to relax some muscle stiffness. Medication and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">certain surgical procedures can also treat upper motor neuron symptoms. Some common muscle relaxants prescribed to patients are Zanaflex, Klonopin and Baclofen [5].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the neurochemical level, \u201cSpasticity results from an inadequate release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system,\u201d according to Mohammed Jan [6].</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a normal neural cell, when GABA interacts with and binds to GABA receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, it decreases the likelihood that the postsynaptic neuron will fire an action potential because of the inhibitory nature of GABA receptors. For a condition like cerebral palsy in which some form of insult or damage has occurred to the brain, especially in the upper motor neurons, the result is hyperactive reflexes (as opposed to the calming sensation). At this point, muscle spasticity begins to become detectable. [</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6]\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Apart from the biological mechanism underlying this condition, particularly significant environmental factors also gravely contributed to Sam\u2019s condition. For eight months, my mother was carrying a normally developing fetus in the womb. However, a few weeks before Sam\u2019s delivery date, my mother could not feel any fetal movement for about three days, so she went to check on it. As she was receiving the examination, Sam unexpectedly made a fluttering movement. If he had not moved, my mother would have had to get a Caesarean section immediately. Since he moved inside, the examiners found nothing to be wrong with the fetus and deemed it safe to send my mother home.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just a few days later, my mom was rushed to the hospital after her labor pain started. At the time, the primary medical staff mostly consisted of medical interns still honing in on decision-making skills during critical situations.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From the time of my mother\u2019s arrival at the hospital, 13 hours passed before a team of doctors and interns determined that she needed a C-section. Once this decision was made, additional time was required by the medical professionals to prepare the room for surgery. All the while, my mom was in labor pain and, unbeknownst to her, the fetus had become separated from the placenta while the umbilical cord suffered damage. By the time the surgery finally ended, Sam had suffered from asphyxiation. According to the Cerebral Palsy Guide, \u201casphyxiation that occurs during labor or delivery may have been caused by medical malpractice or neglect. Early detachment of the placenta, a ruptured uterus during birth or the umbilical cord getting pinched in a way that restricts blood flow can cause oxygen deprivation.\u201d [</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most important aspect of a disease, once established and diagnosed, is treatment and therapy. Asking questions about how to manage pain, how to make daily routines easier to perform, and how to accommodate family members in raising a child with a disability all goes into the planning process of treatment as well. These individuals need more than mere pills in order to get through their daily lives. This is where therapists (i.e. occupational, behavioral, speech, physical, and vocational therapists) and related health advocates, including family members, come into play. While therapists cannot completely remove the condition, they provide a strategy to alleviate psychological symptoms, including feelings of loneliness, fear of who will care for you, or resentment towards oneself. Family psychologists can help children with cerebral palsy by providing an initial assessment in an attempt to gain more insight into the family dynamics. If there seems to be a lack of parental support or lack of child attachment, a family psychologist can address this through therapy sessions with the parents. Therapy sessions allow for parents to individually discuss what they think is working well for the child and other areas that can be improved. The parents are also free to talk about their own personal issues, permitting the psychologist to gain a better understanding of certain triggers for the parents. These triggers can affect caregiving for the child with special needs.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cerebral palsy is more than just a neurological condition. It is a way of life that, for Sam, is entangled in a web of personal, social, familial, caregiver and medical challenges. One noteworthy\u00a0 concept heavily emphasized in the healthcare field today is the importance of a family-centered management model. The notion of a family-centered approach strives to improve the way of life for individuals with the condition in the family in a mutual way. For a family, it can be quite taxing physically and emotionally to have to take care of someone for the rest of their lives. While it is considerably easier for the receiver to reap the benefits of the caregiver, it is more difficult for the caregiver to constantly provide. The family-centered approach tries to find a middle ground where the caregiver or family and the care-receiver are benefitting from each other as much as possible. In a holistic family-centered model, the needs of each family member are taken into consideration.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A study by Susanne King details the role of pediatric neurologists, therapists, and family members, especially parents, in caring for children with cerebral palsy. This study mainly emphasizes the limiting restraints cerebral palsy places on individuals. For example, families with special needs children often have specific ways of communicating, specialized equipment used at home, and a support system consisting of the family members, therapists, and guidance counselors. The heavy emphasis on familial involvement with medical guidance from professionals is the root of family-centered care. King describes that \u201cthese children often have complex long-term needs that are best addressed by a family-centered service delivery model.\u201d[8]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0Oftentimes, we see that those families who have disabled family members are suffering. Some parents, for example, experience great distress because they do not completely understand what is happening to their child and, thus, fail to acknowledge their limitations at times. Others feel that they are incapable of looking after their child but cannot bear the idea of sending them away to an institution.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">King also discusses the lack of investigation of families as a whole practicing care-giving. \u201cAlthough there is much evidence supporting a family-centered approach in the area of parental outcomes, there has been little work reported on the family unit as a whole,\u201d King writes. \u201cThe most common outcome is better psychological well-being for mothers (because they generally were the participants in most of the studies).\u201d[</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">8]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In my family, I can actively see family-centered management of my brother\u2019s condition occurring. I see how both my parents have certain roles in my brother\u2019s life that collectively enable or mobilize him to feel included and respected. I like to call my parents the arms and legs for my brother in a figurative sense, and I like to call myself the eyes for my brother. Working together to the best of our ability, we enable him to see the outside world in a way that\u2019s similar to the way we experience it.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All my life, I have seen my mother perform the role of a caregiver. I have seen so many ups and downs in her situation, and I would always ask myself the following questions. What makes her get up every morning and continue to give the care she does? What makes her not give up? She told me, \u201cI have faith in God, and I know that He creates pathways for me to deal with the physical implications of taking care of a disabled family member and see, I have never had any major problems with your brother. I will continue to give care for as long as my body will allow for me to do so.\u201d[</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Annemarie Mol and John Law of Duke University collaboratively published a research paper detailing how people are more than just the definitions of their disorders or conditions. According to Mol and Law, people actively create and construct their life in a way that either enhances or minimizes the intensity of their conditions. Mol and Law also explain that \u201cthere are boundaries around the body we do\u2026so long as it does not disintegrate, the body-we-do hangs together. It is full of tensions, however.\u201d[</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">9]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Their conclusion on what makes a person pull through encapsulates the reason my mother still continues to care for my brother.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The definition of cerebral palsy as a condition is very limited. Oftentimes people who have debilitating conditions are missing a network or a support system of people, that once established, can essentially improve that family member\u2019s way of life. With the family-centered approach to managing care, one is essentially enabling the disabled family member by actively being a part of their life, including their day-to-day life activities. For example, through the support system we provide for Sam, he can feel that he is in good hands and that he has established emotional and personal security. Although his condition is permanent, it is comforting to know that our family dynamics allow for an environment in which he can thrive while remaining mentally healthy.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Borad, Geeta. \u201cPractices of Care, Interviews.\u201d 8 Dec. 2018.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Debello, William, and Lauren Liets. \u201cMotor Systems.\u201d Lecture, NPB 101, Davis, CA, 20 Jan. 2020.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Emos MC, Rosner J.

For instance,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">labs that research infectious human diseases tend to use primates because of their similarity to humans, whereas geneticists tend to use fruit flies because of their clearly defined and inherited traits. I often wondered what drives the selection of specific model organisms and whether there is any scientific justification behind it. This manuscript introduces Krogh\u2019s principle, a principle which is commonly applied in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> research studies to aid in determining the appropriate model organism. Additionally, a brief research proposal is presented to demonstrate Krogh\u2019s principle on a practical level.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Key Words</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Krogh\u2019s principle, animal behavior, sensory ecology,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leach\u2019s storm-petrel, bladder grasshopper, research proposal</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Krogh\u2019s principle is the gold standard used to choose experimental models in the fields of animal behavior and sensory ecology. The principle states that for every research question, there is a preferred model organism to study, which allows researchers to produce experimental results that help to answer the research question. These preferred organisms often have one or more specialized traits that are particularly well-suited for a researcher\u2019s objectives [1].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0August Krogh developed this principle in the mid 19</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> century, and ever since, scientists worldwide have adapted this principle when selecting model organisms for their research studies.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Krogh\u2019s Principle in Use</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dr. Robyn Hudson is a world-renowned scientist and a leading expert on the effects of chemical olfactory cues on animal behavior. Dr. Hudson applied Krogh\u2019s principle in her research on olfactory learning and development by choosing the European rabbit as a model for her research. Rabbit pups are born blind, but they have a fully-developed sense of smell, also known as olfaction. Additionally, baby pups are fed in the dark conditions of their underground nests. They are also altricial, meaning they are entirely dependent on their mother\u2019s brief nursing. In Hudson\u2019s experiment, the rabbit pups were only visited by their mother once a day to be nursed for about three to four minutes [2].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0Thus, the pups require olfaction to look for their mother\u2019s nipples for milk in order to survive. Given the natural history of this species, scientists can conclude that the baby rabbit\u2019s ability to search for their mother\u2019s nipples is primarily due to olfaction.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, Krogh\u2019s principle applies to Dr. Hudson\u2019s choice of research subjects because rabbits are easy to rear and observe in a laboratory setting. European rabbit pups have evolved plastic mechanisms calibrated by circumstantial odor experience in preceding and current environments. Olfactory plasticity allows the rabbits to modify their behavior in response to olfactory cues such as different scents. This enables the rabbits to learn behaviors evoked by odors and makes the behavior easy to measure and manipulate by researchers [2,3].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0As a result, scientists can measure the rabbits\u2019 behavioral ecology with respect to foraging, which could make the European rabbits a preferred model for olfactory learning. These rabbits are perfectly suited for this type of study because they are born with an innate sense of olfaction, allowing Dr. Hudson and her research team an excellent opportunity for a study aimed at olfactory learning and development.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another illustrative example of Krogh\u2019s principle in use comes from the work of Dr. Brian Hoover. Dr. Hoover\u2019s research interests included the role of olfaction as it pertained to determining mating preferences in avian species. Dr. Hoover investigated mating patterns in Leach\u2019s storm-petrel (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oceanodroma leucorhoa</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) to explore the chemical basis of mate choice through avian olfaction. There are several reasons he chose the Leach\u2019s storm-petrel as the model organism for this study. The Leach\u2019s storm-petrel has among the largest olfactory bulbs of any bird, thus they have an excellent sense of smell [4].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0Olfaction is critical for the Leach\u2019s storm-petrel to locate prey [5].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0In addition, the Leach\u2019s storm-petrels are genetically monogamous and produce only one chick per year. This scenario allows the offspring to have higher genetic quality. An organism\u2019s genotype must be best-fitted for its survival. As the Leach\u2019s storm-petrel only gives one offspring per year, its genetic makeup needs to be suitable to sustain it in its environment so that its survival rate is high. Thus, scientists can collect data about offspring quality and observe the adults\u2019 mating patterns, thereby simplifying the data collection process while maintaining the accuracy of the mating patterns measured.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The population of Leach\u2019s storm-petrel was abundant in the study, which equated to a large and accessible sample size. Sample size is an important consideration for data analysis as it is the determinant of statistical power, the ability to report findings with statistical confidence. There are other species that could have been used in this study, including the mallards (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anas platyrhynchos</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) due to their large olfactory bulbs. The mallard\u2019s reproductive behavior is also driven by olfactory cues [6]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, the mallards are not an ideal model organism compared to the Leach\u2019s storm-petrels in this study because the mallards are polygamous. Therefore, the mallards would not show clear mating preferences compared to the monogamous Leach\u2019s storm-petrel [5,7].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0Both Dr. Hudson and Dr. Hoover utilized Krogh\u2019s principle when designing their respective research studies. Applying Krogh\u2019s principle allows for the intersection of practical study methodology, high quality data, and conclusions that are generalizable beyond the species studied.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Application of Krogh\u2019s Principle  An Experimental Proposal on the Effect of Noise Pollution on Insect Communication</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now that we have examined historical uses, both recent and distant, of Krogh\u2019s principle, we will now examine an application of Krogh\u2019s principle for future research. In light of how useful Krogh\u2019s principle is, it makes sense to propose an additional study on the auditory interference of grasshoppers. This research proposal will explore whether artificial noise in the environment affects insect hearing or communication. Insect perception of a sound is masked by environmental noise pollution. Based on Krogh\u2019s principle, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bullacris membracioides</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (the bladder grasshopper) will be the model organism for this study due to their anatomical and behavioral advantages. Male and female bladder grasshoppers (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bullacris membracioides) </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">call each other during mating using the duet behavior. The duet behavior occurs when a male grasshopper produces a song that is then repeated by a receptive female. Therefore, perception of the male call by the female can be measured by the female\u2019s reply [8].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0Anatomically, female bladder grasshoppers possess a sensitive auditory system of six pairs of ears (A1-A6). The A1 auditory organ contains 2,000 sensilla, which allows them to hear sounds over great distances of up to two kilometers. This is in contrast to other species of grasshoppers (i.e. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Achurum carinatum</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) where females can only hear male calls only within 1-2 meters [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bladder grasshopper female calls range in frequency from 1.5-3.2 kHz [8].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> A common habitat for the bladder grasshopper is on the roadside. Road noises from the motorcycles can be loud (110 dB) and within the frequency range (700 Hz to 1.5 kHz) that could interfere with the auditory system of grasshoppers. Bladder grasshoppers typically mate in daytime, which is the same time as peak traffic noises. As a result, common noise pollution may disrupt perception of grasshopper calls and interfere with mating behavior [10] . </span><span>In addition, it has been shown that grasshoppers exhibit phonotaxi (an organism\u2019s movement in response to sound) in laboratory conditions [8-11].</span><span>\u00a0To test whether artificial noise can disrupt the duetting behavior of the grasshoppers, a female grasshopper will be placed in a glass aquarium in front of an omnidirectional speaker that plays a recording of a male\u2019s song mounted on a parabolic disk. Testing will be done at distance levels such as 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 meters to examine whether distance correlates to the amount of time the female takes to respond. The experiment will be repeated with male calls with traffic noise, traffic noise alone, and no sound at all. Studying the effects of noise pollution on the auditory system using the bladder grasshopper is an example of Krogh\u2019s principle because they are easy to raise and rear in a laboratory setting. Bladder grasshopper\u2019s advantageous hearing made them the model organism of choice in relation to Krogh\u2019s principle, making the hearing behavior more practical to measure and manipulate in response to different noise levels.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Krogh\u2019s principle is an important concept to keep in mind while designing research studies. Many scientists, including Dr. Hudson and Dr. Hoover, around the world have applied this principle in their research to better answer research questions. To further elucidate the utility of Krogh\u2019s principle, an experimental proposal was made concerning the effects of noise pollution on insect communication. The anatomical and behavioral characteristics considered in selecting the bladder grasshopper for this experiment were illustrated. Krogh\u2019s principle provides useful guidance for scientists to select the most representative and practical model organism to study.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Acknowledgments</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The author would like to thank Dr. Gabrielle Nevitt (Professor of the Department of Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior at University of California, Davis) for supporting this research project and provi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ding feedback on early versions of this manuscript.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i>Editor\u2019s Note: A previous version of this article was published on April 18, 2020.

My schedule was filled with preparations for board exams and recitals, and in the absence of the black and white keys, my fingers were always tapping away at any surface I could find. My parents always told me learning the piano was good for my education and will put me ahead in school because it will help with my math and critical thinking in the long run. However, I was never able to understand the connection between the ease of reading music and my ability to calculate complex integrals. In this paper, I will extrapolate on the benefits of learning an instrument in cognitive development.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What do Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, and Barbara McClintock all have in common? Other than their Nobel-prize winning research in their respective fields, all of these scientists share the love of playing a musical instrument. At an early age, Einstein followed after his mother in playing the violin; Heisenberg learned to read music to play the piano at the young age of four; Planck became gifted in playing the organ and piano; McClintock played the tenor banjo in a jazz band during her time at Cornell University [1]. While these researchers spent time honing in on their musical talent, they were engaging both their central and peripheral nervous systems. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Playing an instrument requires the coordination of various parts of the brain working together</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The motor system gauges meticulous movements to develop sound, which is then picked up by the auditory circuitry. Simultaneously, sensory information picked up by fingers and hands are delivered to the brain. Furthermore, individuals reading music use visual nerves to send information to the brain. This is then processed and interpreted to generate a response carried out by the extremities. All the while, the sound of music elicits an emotional response from the player.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-3007 alignleft\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/05/unnamed-260x300.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/05/unnamed-230x265.png 230w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/05/unnamed-260x300.png 260w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/05/unnamed-350x404.png 350w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/05/unnamed.png 455w\" width=\"260\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Feedforward and feedback pathways of the brain are two auditory-motor interactions that are elicited while playing an instrument. Feedforward interactions are predictive manners that can influence motor responses. For example, tapping to the rhythm of a beat in anticipation of the upcoming flux and accents in the piece. Alternatively, feedback interactions are particularly important for stringed instruments such as the violin, where pitch changes and requires continuous management [12]. As shown in Figure 1, the musician must auditorily perceive each note and respond with suitably timed motor changes. All of these neurophysiological components raise questions as to how musical training can confer brain development. Longitudinal studies find that musical training can have an expansive benefit in the development of linguistics, executive function, general IQ and academic achievement [2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Linguistic Skills</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music shares the same dorsal auditory pathway and processing center in the brain with all other sounds.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This passageway is anatomically linked by the arcuate fasciculus, thus suggesting instrumental training will translate to the manifestation of language related skills. This unilateral pathway is central to an array of language related skills, including language development, second-language acquisition, and verbal memory [2]. According to Vaquero et al, \u201cPlaying an instrument or speaking multiple languages involve mapping sounds to motor commands, recruiting auditory and motor regions such as the superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal, inferior frontal and premotor areas, that are organized in the auditory dorsal stream\u201d [10].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers studying the effects of acoustic sounds mimicking stop consonant speech on language development find that children learning instruments during the critical developmental period (0-6 years old), </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">build lasting structural and organizational modification in their auditory system that will later affect language skills</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Stop consonants include voiceless sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/, as well as voiced sounds /b/, /d/, and /g/. Dr. Strait and her colleagues describe their observations, \u201cGiven relationships between subcortical speech-sound distinctions and critical language and reading skills, music training may offer an efficient means of improving auditory processing in young children\u201d [11].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similarly, Dr. Patel suggests the existence of an overlap of shared brain connections amongst speech and music due to the requirement for accuracy while playing an instrument. Refining this finesse demands attentional training combined with self-motivation and determination. Repeated stimulation of these brain networks garner \u201cemotional reinforcement potential\u201d which is key to \u201c\u2026 good performance of musicians in speech processing\u201d [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond stimulating auditory neurons, instrumental training has been shown to improve verbal memory. For example, in a comparative analysis, researchers find children who have undergone musical training demonstrate verbal memory advantages compared to their peers without training [4]. Furthermore, following up a year after the initial study, they found that continued practice led to substantial advancement in verbal memory, while those who discontinued failed to show any improvement. This finding is supported by Jakobson et al in which researchers correlate, \u201c\u2026 enhanced verbal memory performance in musicians is a byproduct of the effect of music instruction on the development of auditory temporal-order processing abilities\u201d [5].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the case of acquiring a second language [abbreviated L2], a study conducted on 50 Japanese adults learning English finds, \u201c\u2026 the ability to analyze musical sound structure would also likely facilitate the analysis of a novel phonological structure of an L2\u201d [6]. These researchers further elaborate on the potential of improving English syntax with musical exercises concentrating on syntactic processes, such as \u201c\u2026 hierarchical relationships between harmonic or melodic musical elements\u201d [6]. Multiple studies have also identified music training to invoke specific structures in the brain also employed during language processing, including Heschl\u2019s gyrus and Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s areas [2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While music and language elements are stored in different regions of the brain, the common auditory pathway gives way to instrumental training strengthening linguistic development in multiple areas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Executive Function</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Executive function is the application of the prefrontal cortex to carry out tasks requiring conscious effort to attain a goal, particularly in novel scenarios [7]. This umbrella term includes cognitive control in attention and inhibition, working memory, and the ability to task switch. Psychologists Dr. Hannon and Dr. Trainor find formal musical education to be a direct implementation of, \u201c\u2026 domain-specific effects on the neural encoding of musical structure, enhancing musical performance, music reading and explicit knowledge of the musical structure\u201d [8]. The combination of domain-general development and executive functioning can influence linguistics, in addition to mathematical development. Whilst learning an instrument, musicians are required to actively read music notes considered to be a unique language and focus on the ability to translate their visual findings into precise mechanical maneuvers, demanding careful focus. All the while, lending attention to identify and remedy errors in harmony, tone, beat, and fingering. Furthermore, becoming well-trained requires scheduled rehearsals to build a foundational framework for operating the instrument while learning new technical elements and building robust spatial awareness. Thus, this explicit practice of executive function during these scheduled practice sessions are essential in sculpting this region of the prefrontal cortex.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>General Iq and Academic Performance</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While listening to music has been found to also confer academic advantage, the active practice of deliberately playing music in an ordered process grants musically apt individuals scholastic benefits absent in their counterparts. In a study conducted by Schellenberg, 144 six year-olds were assigned into one of four groups\u2013 music groups included keyboard or voice lessons while control groups provided drama classes or no lesson at all. After 36 weeks, using the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2013Third Edition (WISC-III),composed of varying assessments to evaluate intelligence, data supports all four groups having a significant increase in IQ. However, this can also be attributed to the start of grade school. Despite the general rise in IQ, individuals that received keyboard or voice lessons proved a greater jump in IQ. Schellenberg</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> discusses this finding of musically-trained six year-olds demonstrating elevated IQ scores to mirror that of school attendance. He reasons participation in school increases one\u2019s IQ and the smaller the learning setting is, the more academic success the student will be able to achieve. Similarly, music lessons are often taught individually or in small groups which mirrors a school structure, thus ensuing IQ boosts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Possible Confounding Factors</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While these studies have found a positive correlation amongst individuals learning musical instruments with varying brain maturation skills, these researchers mark the importance in taking into consideration confounding factors that often cannot be controlled for. These include socioeconomic level, prior IQ, education, and other activities participants are associated with. While many of these researchers worked to gather subjects with similarities in these domains, all of these external elements can play an essential role during one\u2019s developmental period. Moreover, formally learning an instrument is often a financially hefty extracurricular activity, thus more affluent families with higher educational backgrounds can typically afford these programs for their children.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, each study implemented varying practice times, music training durations, and instruments participants were required to learn. The data gathered from these findings can elicit results that may not be reproducible under different parameters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond these external factors, one must also consider each participant\u2019s willingness to learn the instrument. If one does not hold the desire or motivation to become musically educated, spending the required time playing the instrument does not necessarily correlate to positive results with development as those regions of the brain are not actively utilized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Numerous studies have been carried out to demonstrate the varying benefits music training can provide for cognitive development. Extensive research has proven that the process of physically, mentally, and emotionally engaging oneself to learning an instrument can award diverse advantages to the maturing brain. The discipline and rigor needed to garner expertise in playing a musical instrument is unconsciously translated to the experimental setting. Likewise, the unique melodious tunes found in each piece sparks creativity to propose imaginative visions. While instrumental education does not fully account for Einstein, Heisenberg, Planck and McClintock\u2019s scientific success, this extracurricular activity has been shown to provide a substantial boost in critical thinking.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe Symphony of Science.\u201d The Nobel Prize, March 2019. https://www.symphonyofscience.com/vids.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miendlarzewska, Ewa A., and Wiebke J.

I was interested in her research in dendritic spines and its correlation to my personal area of interest in research regarding the language and cognitive deficiencies present in different populations such as individuals with schizophrenia. There seems to be a correlational link between the generation and quantity of dendritic spines and the presence of different neurological disorders. Given the dynamic nature of dendritic spines, current research is studying their exact role and the potential to manipulate these spines in order to impact learning and memory.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dendritic spines are small bulbous protrusions that line the sides of dendrites on a neuron [12]. Dendritic spines serve as a major site of synapses for excitatory neurons, which continue signal propagation in the brain. Relatively little is known about the exact purpose and role of dendritic spines, but as of now, there seems to be a correlation between the concentration of dendritic spines and the presence of different disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scientists hypothesize that dendritic spines are a key player in the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric disorders</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [8]. It should be noted that other morphological changes are also observed when comparing individuals with the mentioned neuropsychiatric disorders are compared to neurotypical individuals. However, all these disorders share the common thread of abnormal dendritic spine density.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The main disorders studied in relation to dendritic spine density are autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Current studies suggest that these disorders result in the number of dendritic spines straying from what is observed in a neurotypical individual. It should be noted that there is a general decline in dendritic spines as an individual ages. However intellectual disabilities and neuropsychiatric disorders seem to alter this density at a more extreme rate. The graph demonstrates the general trend of dendritic spine density for various disorders; however, these trends may slightly vary across individuals with the same disorder.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Dendritic Spines</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I. Role of Dendritic Spines</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dendritic spines are protrusions found on certain types of neurons throughout the brain, such as in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. They were first identified by Ramon y Cajal, who classified them as \u201cthorns or short spines\u201d located nonuniformly along the dendrite [6].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The entire human cerebral cortex consists of 10</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> dendritic spines. A single dendrite can contain several hundred spines [12]. There is an overall greater density of dendritic spines on peripheral dendrites versus proximal dendrites and the cell body [3]. Their main role is to assist in synapse formation on dendrites.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dendritic Spines fall into two categories: persistent and transient spines. Persistent spines are considered \u2018memory\u2019 spines, while transient spines are considered \u2018learning\u2019 spines. Transient spines are categorized as spines that exist for four days or less and persistent spines as spines that exist for eight days or longer [5].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The dense concentration of spines on dendrites is crucial to the fundamental nature of dendrites. At an excitatory synaptic cleft, the release of the neurotransmitter at excitatory receptors on the postsynaptic cell results in an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which causes the cell to fire an action potential. An action potential is where a signal is transmitted from one neuron to another neuron. In order for a neuron to propagate an action potential, there must be an accumulation of positive charge at the synapses, reaching a certain threshold (</span><h4>Figure 2</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). The cell must reach a certain level of depolarization \u2013 a difference in charge across the neuron\u2019s membrane making the inside more positive. A single EPSP may not result in enough depolarization to reach this action potential threshold. As a result, the presence of multiple dendritic spines on the dendrite allows for multiple synapses to be formed and multiple EPSPs to be summated. With the summation of various EPSPs on the dendrites of the neurons, the cell can reach the action potential threshold. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The greater density of dendritic spines along the postsynaptic cell allows for more synaptic connections to be formed, increasing the chance of an action potential to occur.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3045 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"585\" sizes=\"(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/06/101797265_542664446429640_164041865686165145_n.jpg\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/06/101797265_542664446429640_164041865686165145_n-230x186.jpg 230w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/06/101797265_542664446429640_164041865686165145_n-300x242.jpg 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/06/101797265_542664446429640_164041865686165145_n-350x282.jpg 350w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/06/101797265_542664446429640_164041865686165145_n-480x387.jpg 480w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/06/101797265_542664446429640_164041865686165145_n.jpg 725w\" width=\"725\"/></p>\n<p><h4>Figure 2.</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firing of Action Potential (EPSP)</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neurotransmitter is released by the presynaptic cell into the synaptic cleft.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For an EPSP, an excitatory neurotransmitter will be released, which will bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The binding of these excitatory neurotransmitters will result in sodium channels opening, allowing sodium to go down its electrical and chemical gradient \u2013 depolarizing the cell.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The EPSPs will be summated at the axon hillock and trigger an action potential.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This actional potential will cause the firing cell to release a neurotransmitter at its axon terminal, further conveying the electrical signal to other neurons.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">II. Creation\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dendrites initially are formed without spines. As development progresses, the plasma membrane of the dendrite forms protrusions called filopodia. These filopodia then form synapses with axons, and eventually transition from filopodia to dendritic spines [6].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The reason behind the creation of dendritic spines is currently unknown. There are a few potential hypotheses. The first hypothesis suggests that the presence of dendritic spines can increase the packing density of synapses, allowing for more potential synapses to be formed. The second hypothesis suggests that their presence can help prevent excitotoxicity, overexcitation of the excitatory receptors (NMDA and AMPA receptors) present on the dendrites. These receptors usually bind with glutamate, a typically excitatory neurotransmitter, released from the presynaptic cell. This can result in damage to the neuron or if more severe, neuronal death. Since dendritic spines compartmentalize charge [3], this feature helps prevent the dendrite from being over-excited beyond the threshold potential for an action potential. Lastly, another hypothesis suggests that the large variation in dendritic spine morphology suggests that these different shapes play a role in modulating how postsynaptic potentials can be processed by the dendrite based on the function of the signal.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The creation of these dendritic spines is rapid during early development, slowly tapering off as the individual gets older. This process is mostly replaced with the pruning of synapses formed with dendritic spines when the individual is older. Pruning helps improve the signal-to-noise ratio of signals sent within neuronal circuits [3]. The signal-to-noise ratio outlines the ratio of signals sent by neurons and signals actually received by postsynaptic cells. It determines the efficiency of signal transmission. Experimentation has shown that the presence of glutamate and excitatory receptors (such as NMDA and AMPA) can result in the formation of dendritic spines within seconds [3]. The introduction of NMDA and AMPA results in cleavage of intracellular adhesion molecule-5 (ICAM5) from hippocampal neurons. ICAM5 is a \u201cneuronal adhesion molecule that regulates dendritic elongation and spine maturation. [11]\u201d Furthermore, through a combination of fluorescent dye and confocal or two-photon laser scanning microscopy, scientists were able to use imaging technology to witness that spines can undergo minor changes within seconds and more drastic conformational changes, even disappearing over minutes to hours [12].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">III. Morphology</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The spine head\u2019s morphology, a large bulbous head connected to a very thin neck that attaches to the dendrite, assists in its role as a postsynaptic cell. This shape allows one synapse at a dendritic spine to be activated and strengthened without influencing neighboring synapses [12].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dendritic spine shape is extremely dynamic, allowing one spine to slightly alter its morphology throughout its lifetime [5]. However, dendritic spine morphology seems to take on a predominant form that is determined by the brain region of its location. For instance, presynaptic neurons from the thalamus take on the mushroom shape, whereas the lateral nucleus of the amygdala have thin spines on their dendrites [2]. The type of neuron and brain region the spine originates from seem to be correlated to the observed morphology.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The spine contains a postsynaptic density, which consists of neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, scaffolding proteins, and signaling molecules [12]. In addition to this, the spine has smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which forms stacks called spine apparatus. It further has polyribosomes, hypothesized to be the site of local protein synthesis in these spines, and an actin-based cytoskeleton for structure [12]. The actin-based cytoskeleton makes up for the lack of microtubules and intermediate filaments, which play a crucial role in the structure and transport of most of our animal cells. Furthermore, these spines are capable of compartmentalizing calcium, the ion used at neural synapses that signal the presynaptic cell to release its neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft [12]. Calcium plays a crucial role in second messenger cascades, influencing neural plasticity [6]. It also plays a role in actin polymerization, which allows for the motile nature of spine morphology [6].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many various shapes for dendritic spines. The common types are \u2018stubby\u2019 (short and thick spines with no neck), \u2018thin\u2019 (small head and thin neck), \u2018mushroom\u2019 (large head with a constricted neck), and \u2018branched\u2019 (two heads branching from the same neck) [12].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">IV. Learning and Memory</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dendritic spines play a crucial role in memory and learning through occurrence of long-term potentiation (LTP), which is thought to be the cellular level of learning and memory. LTP is thought to induce spine formation, which hints at the common correlation that learning is associated with the formation of dendritic spines. Furthermore, LTP is thought to be capable of altering the immature and mature hippocampus, commonly associated with memory [2]. To contrast LTP, long-term depression (LTD) essentially works opposite to LTP \u2013 decreasing the dendritic spine density and size [2].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The correlation between dendritic spines and learning is relatively unknown. There seems to be a general trend suggesting that the creation of these spines is associated with learning. However, it is unclear whether learning results in the formation of these spines or if the formation of these spines results in learning. The general idea behind this hypothesis is that dendritic spines aid in the formation of synapses, allowing the brain to form more connections. As a result, a decline in these dendritic spines in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, can inhibit an individual\u2019s ability to learn. This is observed in various cognitive and linguistic deficiencies observed in individuals with schizophrenia.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Memory is associated with the strengthening and weakening of connections due to LTP and LTD, respectively. The alteration of these spines through LTP and LTD is called activity-dependent plasticity [6]. The main morphological shapes associated with memory are the mushroom spine, a large head with a constricted neck, and the stubby spine, a short and thick spine with no neck [6]. Both of these spines are relatively large, resulting in more stable and enduring connections. These bigger and heavier spines associated with learning are a result of LTP. By contrast, transient spines (live four days or shorter) are usually smaller and more immature in morphology and function, resulting in more temporary and less stable connections.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LTP and LTD play a crucial role in modifying dendritic spine morphology. Neuropsychiatric disorders can alter these mechanisms resulting in abnormal density and size of these spines.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Schizophrenia</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I. What is Schizophrenia?\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that results in disordered thinking and behaviors, hallucinations, and delusions [9]. The exact mechanics of schizophrenia are still being studied as researchers are trying to determine the underlying biological reasons behind this disorder and a way to help these individuals. Current treatment is focused on reducing and in some cases treating symptoms of this disorder, but more research and understanding is required to fully treat this mental disorder.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">II. Causation</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The exact source of schizophrenia seems to lie somewhere between the presence of certain genes and environmental effects. There seems to be a correlation between traumatic or stressful life events during an individual\u2019s adolescence to an increased susceptibility to developing schizophrenia [1]. While research is still underway, certain studies point to cannabis having a role in increasing susceptibility to schizophrenia or worsening symptoms if an individual already has schizophrenia [1]. There seems to be some form of a genetic correlation, given an increased likelihood of developing schizophrenia if present in a family member. This factor seems to result from a combination of genes; however, no genes have been identified yet. There also seems to be a chemical component, given the variation of chemical composition and density of neurotypical individuals and individuals with schizophrenia. Specifically, researchers have observed an elevated amount of dopamine found in individuals with schizophrenia [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">III. Relationship between Dendritic Spines and Schizophrenia\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A common thread among most schizophrenia patients is an impairment of pyramidal neuron (prominent cell form found in the cerebral cortex) dendritic morphology, occurring in various regions of the cerebral cortex [7]. Observed in postmortem brain tissue studies, there seems to be a reduced density of dendritic spines in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia. These findings are consistent with various regions of the brain that have been studied, such as the frontal and temporal neocortex, the primary visual cortex, and the subiculum within the hippocampal formation [7]. Out of seven studies observing this finding, the median reported decrease in spine density was 23%, with the overall range of these various studies being a decline of 6.5% to 66% [7].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It should be noted that studies were done to see if the decline in spine density was due to the usage of antipsychotic drugs. However animal and human trials showed no significant difference in the dendritic spine density of tested individuals.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This decline in dendritic spine density is hypothesized to be the result of the failure of the brain of schizophrenic individuals to produce sufficient dendritic spines at birth or if there is a more rapid decline of these spines during adolescence, where the onset of schizophrenia is typically observed [7]. The source of this decline is unclear, but seems to be attributed to deficits in pruning, maintenance, or simply the mechanisms of the underlying formation of these dendritic spines [7].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, there are conflicting results. For instance, Thompson et al. conducted a study that seemed to suggest that a decline in spine density resulted in a progressive decline of gray matter, typically observed in schizophrenic individuals. Thompson et al. conducted an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> study of this phenomena. The study used MRI scans for twelve schizophrenic individuals and twelve neurotypical individuals, finding a progressive decline in gray matter \u2013 starting in the parietal lobe and expanding out to motor, temporal, and prefrontal areas [10]. The study suggests that the main attribution for this is a decline in dendritic spine density with the progression of the disorder. This study coincides with the previously mentioned hypothesis of a decline of spines during adolescence.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is also possible that there is a combination of both of these factors occurring. Most studies have only been able to observe postmortem brain tissue, creating the confusion of whether there is a decline in spines or if the spines are simply not produced in the first place.

Their role in these crucial functions has been reflected by their absence in various neuropsychiatric disorders \u2013 such as schizophrenia, certain learning deficits present in some individuals with ASD, and memory deficits present in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These deficits seem to occur during the early creation of neural networks in the brain at synapses. Further research understanding the development of these spines and the creation of different morphological forms can be crucial in determining how to potentially cure or treat these deficiencies present in neuropsychiatric and learning disorders.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NHS Choices</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, NHS, www.nhs.uk/conditions/schizophrenia/causes/.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bourne, Jennifer N, and Kristen M Harris. \u201cBalancing Structure and Function at Hippocampal Dendritic Spines.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Annual Review of Neuroscience</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2008, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2561948/.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDendritic Spines: Spectrum: Autism Research News.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spectrum</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, www.spectrumnews.org/wiki/dendritic-spines/.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hofer, Sonja B., and Tobias Bonhoeffer. \u201cDendritic Spines: The Stuff That Memories Are Made Of?\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Current Biology</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 20, no. 4, 2010, doi:10.1016/j.cub.2009.12.040.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Holtmaat, Anthony J.G.D., et al. \u201cTransient and Persistent Dendritic Spines in the Neocortex In Vivo.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neuron</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Cell Press, 19 Jan. 2005, www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627305000048.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">McCann, Ruth F, and David A Ross. \u201cA Fragile Balance: Dendritic Spines, Learning, and Memory.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Biological Psychiatry</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 15 July 2017, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5712843/.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moyer, Caitlin E, et al. \u201cDendritic Spine Alterations in Schizophrenia.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neuroscience Letters</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 5 Aug. 2015, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4454616/.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Penzes, Peter, et al. \u201cDendritic Spine Pathology in Neuropsychiatric Disorders.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nature Neuroscience</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Mar. 2011, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530413/.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSchizophrenia.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mayo Clinic</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 7 Jan. 2020, www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354443.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSchizophrenia and Dendritic Spines.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ness Labs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, 20 June 2019, nesslabs.com/schizophrenia-dendritic-spines.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSynaptic Cleft: Anatomy, Structure, Diseases &amp;amp; Functions.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Human Memory</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, 17 Oct. 2019, human-memory.net/synaptic-cleft/.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tian, Li, et al. \u201cActivation of NMDA Receptors Promotes Dendritic Spine Development through MMP-Mediated ICAM-5 Cleavage.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Journal of Cell Biology</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Rockefeller University Press|1, 13 Aug. 2007, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2064474/.</span></li>\n<li>Zito, Karen, and Venkatesh N.

While there are still a lot of questions that remain unanswered within this field, I was interested in learning more about current theories and hypotheses that address some of these questions. Special thanks to Professor Zito for talking to us about her research. It was an honor to talk to her about her passion and knowledge for this exciting and complex field.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Preface</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: This interview is a follow-up to an original literature review on dendritic spines. For a more in-depth look at general information on dendritic spines, check out </span><a href=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/the-role-of-dendritic-spine-density-in-neuropsychiatric-and-learning-disorders/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neha Madugala (NM): Can you briefly describe some of the research that your lab does?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dr. Karen Zito (KZ): My lab is interested in learning and memory. Specifically, we want to understand the molecular and cellular changes that occur in the brain as we learn. Our brain consists of circuits, connecting groups of neurons, and the function of these circuits allows us to learn new skills and form new memories. Notably, the strength of connections between specific neurons in these circuits can change during learning, or neurons can form new connections with other neurons to support learning. We have been mainly focusing on structural changes in the brain. This includes questions such as the following: How do neurons change in structure during learning? How do new circuit connections get made? What are the molecular signaling pathways that are activated to allow these changes to happen while learning? How is the plasticity of neural circuits altered with age or due to disease?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: What are dendritic spines?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: Dendritic spines are microscopic protrusions from dendrites of neurons and are often the site of change associated with learning. Axons of one neuron will synapse onto the dendritic spine of another neuron. Spines will grow and retract during development and synapses between a spine and axon will form during learning, forming complex circuits that allow us to do intricate tasks such as playing the piano.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: Transient spines only last a couple of days. What role do they play in learning?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: One hypothesis for the function of transient spines is that they exist to sample the environment, allowing the brain to speed up its ability to find the right connections required for learning. Thus, the rapid growth and retraction of transient spines in the brain helps our neurons find the right connections required to form the new neural circuits by sampling many more connections and narrowing in on the right ones. For instance, in a past study on songbirds, researchers found that baby songbirds with faster moving transient spines were able to learn songs quicker than baby songbirds with slower moving transient spines. Once these transient spines find the right connection, they will transition from transient to a permanent spine to partake in a circuit that supports a new behavior, such as the songbird learning a new song.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: Can presynaptic neurons directly synapse onto a dendrite or only a dendritic spine?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: Many neurons do not have spines at all. Spines are predominantly present on neurons in the higher order areas of the brain involved in learning, memory, perception and cognition. Spiny neurons are present in areas of the brain where neural connections are changing over time, or plastic \u2014 allowing the brain to learn, adjust, and change. Certain areas of the brain do not require a lot of change and, in some cases, circuit change may be detrimental to function. For example, we may not want to change connections established for movement of specific muscles.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: What is the difference between synapses that occur directly on a dendrite versus onto a dendritic spine?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: Importantly, the molecular composition at synapses can vary widely between synapses, regardless of whether this connection occurs at a shaft or a spine. Therefore, it is difficult to name specific compositional elements always found at a spine versus a shaft. Inhibitory synapses, formed by GABAergic neurons, tend to be found directly on the shaft of dendrites. Glutamatergic neurons, which are excitatory, in the cerebral cortex tend to synapse on dendritic spines, but can also connect directly with the dendrite.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: All dendritic spines have excitatory synapses that require NMDA and AMPA receptors [1].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Are these receptors necessary for these spines to exist?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: To my knowledge, we do not know the answer to this question. It is possible to remove these receptors a few at a time, and spines do not disappear. However, it is really hard to remove a receptor from a single spine and, if the receptors are removed from the entire neuron, it is often replaced with another receptor in a process called compensation. In order to test if this is possible, someone would have to knock out all genes encoding AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors, which is over seven genes, to see if spines still formed. Notably, if AMPA receptors are internalized, the spine typically shrinks, and if more AMPA receptors are brought to the surface, the spine typically grows. Indeed, the number of AMPA receptors at the synapse is directly proportional to the size of the spine.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: What drives spine formation and elimination when creating and refining neural circuits?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: There really is no definitive answer to this question currently, and many of those performing dendritic spine research are interested in answering these questions. Let\u2019s first look at formation. One theory suggests that there are factors coming from neighboring neurons, such as glutamate or BDNF [2],</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> which promote spine formation. However, it is unclear which of these are acting </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, in the animal. Also, spine formation is much greater in younger animals compared to older animals. That can suggest that the cells are in a different state when younger versus older. The cell can be a less plastic state where all the spines are moving slowly, seen in older animals, or more plastic states where all the spines are moving more quickly, seen in younger animals. Thus, there appears to be a combination of intrinsic state, or how plastic the cell is, and extracellular factors such as the presence of glutamate that dictates spine formation. Elimination is similar in that we do not really know the entire molecular signaling sequence that is driving it. It is a fascinating question for so many reasons. For example, when we are young we overproduce spines, and as we grow the spine density declines as our nervous system selectively chooses which connections to keep. Then, as adults, our spine density remains relatively stable. However, we obviously keep learning as adults, even though our spine density remains constant. One hypothesis is that, as a spine grows while learning, a nearby spine with no activity shrinks and eventually becomes eliminated. In fact, we have observed this phenomenon in our studies. Therefore, there may be some local competition between these spines for space. This keeps the density the same across most of the adult life span.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: Does learning drive the formation of synaptic spines or does synaptic spine formation drive learning?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: This may depend on the type of learning. Both have been observed. Studies have been done imaging the brain during learning. Some people have found an increase in new spine growth suggesting that learning drives new spine formation. Other people say they found the same number of new spine growth, but a greater amount of new spine stabilization, suggesting that learning drives new spine stabilization.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: It has been observed that some intellectual disabilities and neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with an abnormal number of dendritic spines when compared to a neurotypical individual. Is this related to the insufficient production of dendritic spines at birth or deficits in pruning?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: Indeed autism spectrum disorders have been associated with an increase in spines. This could potentially be associated with an overproduction of spines or reduced spine elimination. Notably, the majority of neurological disorders resulting in cognitive deficits, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, are associated with decreased spine densities. It is unclear if the spine numbers or brain function diminishes first, but much of the current research seems to suggest that the spines go away first, leading to the cognitive problems observed. In many disorders with too few spines, there is a normal formation of spines but excessive elimination. This is seen as Alzheimer and schizophrenic patients\u2019 spine density is relatively normal prior to disease onset. For Alzheimer\u2019s specifically, some researchers suggest that the molecular release of the pathogenic amyloid beta peptide binds to molecules on the surface of the dendritic spine that drive spine loss.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NM: How might dendritic spine research help in treating neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KZ: Current research is looking at how to stabilize and destabilize dendritic spines. If we were able to manipulate the stability of these spines, we could potentially help rescue the stability of spines in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, which could potentially lead to better therapies and outcomes. Understanding the pathways that control the stability of these spines will allow researchers to find targets for future therapeutic treatments.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Footnotes</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><h4>Receptors that are permeable to cations.

        "title": "Potential Therapeutic Effects of sEH Inhibition in Neurological Disorders",
        "author": "Nathifa Nasim, Neurobiology, Physiology & Behavior \u201822",
        "date": "05/29/2021",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I was recently introduced to this topic and the potential for sEH inhibition in the context of Alzheimer\u2019s while at Dr. Lee-Way Jin\u2019s lab in the MIND Institute. Further research into the topic outside the lab led to the realization of the broader implications of sEH inhibition across numerous neurological disorders through its role in inflammatory pathways. The paper aims to illustrate the therapeutic potential sEH inhibition in neurological disorders through inflammation mediation.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neuroinflammation is a symptom of nearly all neurological disorders, and occurs when the immune system of the brain is activated. Microglia, an immune cell in the brain, release inflammatory mediators typically associated with neuroprotection and neurogenesis. However, incessant inflammation can be associated with harmful effects and neurological diseases. Therefore, treatments that target inflammatory processes are of interest to researchers as they have the potential to alleviate numerous disorders. The soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme (sEH), an enzyme that modulates various physiological processes through the regulation of inflammatory pathways, is one such possible therapeutic agent. Research on the effect of sEH inhibition provides an avenue for treating different neurological disorders such as brain injury, depression, and Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>sEH and the Role of EETs</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sEH enzyme is important primarily through its ability to metabolize fatty acids in inflammatory pathways. It is found across mammalian tissues, such as in the brain or the liver, where it is highly expressed. As a member of the epoxide hydrolase family of enzymes, sEH\u2019s C-terminus is responsible for the enzyme\u2019s characteristic epoxide hydrolase activity, converting epoxides by adding a water molecule. The N-terminus, on the other hand, has phosphatase activity instead [2]. Due to the different activities of the two sides of the enzyme, the N-terminal phosphatase domain has been linked to cholesterol metabolism, while the C-terminal domain has been associated with inflammatory and cardiovascular effects.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The epoxide hydrolase activity of sEH is performed on epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), epoxy fatty acids that act as lipid messengers in the body. Due to their nature as lipid messengers, EETs have numerous roles, such as being anti-inflammatory messengers and increasing vasodilation. An increase in EET levels provides anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects [2]. These protective effects of EET may be especially acute in the brain. For example, the inhibition of the cytochrome p450 enzyme results in an absence of EET, which reduces cerebral blood flow by 30 percent, indicating a critical need for EET in brain circulation [4].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inhibition of sEH, a negative regulator of EET, increases these protective effects of EETs. The enzyme lowers EET activity via conversion to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), which have less anti-inflammatory effects, and can be pro-inflammatory instead. Numerous studies have knocked out or selectively inhibited sEH which stabilizes or increases EET activity because it is no longer being converted into DHET. It is through sEH\u2019s metabolism of EETs that it is linked to numerous diseases and various physiological effects, as EETs are critical in controlling inflammation. Research on the possible therapeutic effects of sEH is therefore primarily focused on increasing fatty acid/EET levels through inhibition of sEH.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Inflammation in Brain Injury</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neuroinflammation is a critical aspect of traumatic brain injury (TBI), or brain damage via physical injury. TBI results in cerebral inflammation, which activates microglia to produce post-traumatic inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species (ROS). While inflammatory mediators function as an immune response after injury, their overproduction after TBI can lead to neural damage, apoptosis (cell death) and/or brain edema (swelling due to the accumulation of fluids). This additional damage occurring in the brain stimulates an increased microglia response, resulting in a positive feedback mechanism [5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inhibition of this post-traumatic stress-induced inflammation is a common mechanism in treating TBI. Given sEH\u2019s role in inflammation, deletion of sEH via genetic knockouts has been shown to improve these effects. Deletion of sEH decreases the number of activated microglia post-TBI, and as a result, reduces the release of inflammatory mediators, thereby reducing edema, apoptosis, and inflammation [5]. The rise in EET levels associated with sEH inhibition also results in anti-inflammatory effects, and possibly an increase in neurotrophic factors, or growth factors that have a neuroprotective effect [5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>sEH and Alzheimer\u2019s</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neuroinflammation is also linked to both the onset and progression of Alzheimer\u2019s. Prolonged activation of glial cells</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> astrocytes and microglia</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">increase proinflammatory molecules which lead to a \u201cneurotoxic\u201d environment that aggravates the disease [6]. Alzheimer\u2019s patients have nearly twofold higher sEH levels in the astrocytes, leading to lower EET levels and thus lower anti-inflammatory effects [7]. Given the importance of inflammation in Alzheimer\u2019s, inhibition of sEH should increase EET levels, promoting anti-inflammatory effects crucial to treating the disease.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One experiment treated 5xFAD mice, transgenic mice that express Alzheimer\u2019s phenotypes, with an sEH inhibitor TPPU. The results indicated that not only did the mice have increased EET levels, the inhibitor had also affected gene expression in the hippocampus by downregulating proinflammatory genes. This effectively \u201ccalmed\u201d the overactive immune response correlated with Alzheimer\u2019s. Further testing uncovered that these treated mice had fewer, smaller amyloid plaques, or proteins that are considered to play a critical role in Alzheimer\u2019s and are often regarded as a biomarker for the disease, and fewer microglia surrounding these plaques [6]. As prolonged activation of microglia leads to proinflammatory effects and reduced phagocytosis of amyloid plaques, lowering the immune response of these glial cells could theoretically reverse these inflammatory effects. The reduction effects of EETs on ROS may also be involved, as ROS may contribute to neurotoxicity [7]. These results were achieved with TPPU and verified with another sEH inhibitor; it also aligned with results seen in genetic knockouts of sEH [6].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>sEH in Peripheral Organs</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to the brain, peripheral organs may also play an important role in sEH\u2019s effects on neurological disorders. In addition to astrocytes and other glial cells, sEH is most expressed in the liver. With the liver being the largest gland and responsible for a variety of metabolic activities, hepatic sEH (sEH of the liver) has an influence throughout the body. In a study on major depressive disorder (MDD) by Qin </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, researchers used mice in a chronic mild stress model (CMS), where they were exposed to varying stressors to mimic the effects of depression in an animal model. They found that chronic stress increased sEH levels in mice liver, suggesting hepatic sEH levels are linked to stress and depression [8]. Increased sEH levels in these mice via targeted gene therapy not only led to depressive-like behaviors, but there was also a decrease in proteins that modulate synaptic plasticity, suggesting that sEH parallels the effects of stress at the molecular level. On the other hand, deleting the gene that codes for sEH in the liver induced an antidepressant effect in the CMS mice [8]. In other words, sEH induced depressive-like effects, and inhibiting sEH activity led to antidepressant-like effects, even in stressed model mice. These findings were paralleled in MDD human patients who had lower EET levels compared to the control group, suggesting higher sEH activity in patients with depression, again similar to the Alzheimer\u2019s patients [8].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Given the anti-inflammatory abilities of EETs, further development of sEH inhibitors has the capacity to affect the treatment of multiple neurodegenerative diseases which are associated with inflammation. In addition to those mentioned, other neurological conditions and disorders have also exhibited elevated sEH levels, such as Parkinson\u2019s, schizophrenia, and seizures [6]. As these diseases have different pathologies, the cause for elevated sEH levels may vary and is still under research. Nevertheless, the implication of sEH in a variety of diseases expands the therapeutic range of sEH inhibitors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As seen in the aforementioned MDD study by Qin </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, peripheral organs\u2019 usage of sEH may also be involved with neurological disorders, such as in the case of hepatic sEH. This not only points to a possible liver-brain axis or connection between the two organs, it also opens another avenue of research into the effects of sEH across the body. Diseases such as depression and heart disease have been implicated with sEH in previous studies, for example, and at present, sEH inhibition has been successful in decreasing blood pressure levels [9]. Development and further research into sEH inhibition and effects therefore have the potential to touch numerous conditions and parts of the human body.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The research regarding Alzheimer\u2019s and TBI both implemented pharmacological sEH inhibitors, in which only the C-terminal hydrolase domain of the enzyme was affected while the N-terminal phosphatase activity was left intact [5,6]. As the N-terminal has been associated with cholesterol metabolism, its role in neurological disorders provides another possible area of study of sEH in treating these disorders. Genetic deletion of the gene that codes for sEH, as seen in the Qin </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> study, deletes both the hydrolase and phosphatase activity of the enzyme. Therefore, studies implementing sEH knockouts may have benefitted from the loss of the phosphatase activity as well as the hydrolase [9]. As a result, further research into different aspects of the enzyme broadens the possibility of its usage and potential.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wee Yong V. 2010.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> As a psychology major who used to be a plant biology major, I\u2019m very interested in the arenas where these two fields interact. Such is the case with psychoactive plants and fungi that produce significant alterations in brain chemistry and other aspects of the human psyche. That is why I chose to write about psychedelics and their rebirth in both research and culture. In the past few months, I have seen increasing media coverage of new scientific findings about these substances, as well as legal advancements in their decriminalization, making this a relevant topic in the worlds of psychology and ethnobotany. The history of psychedelics is a long and complicated one, but here I attempt to cover the basics in hopes of demystifying these new powerful therapeutic treatments and informing readers about the latest horizon in mental health.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After decades in the dark, psychedelic drugs are finally resurfacing in the world of science and medicine as potential new tools for mental health treatment. Psychedelics, otherwise known as hallucinogens, are a class of psychoactive substances that have the power to alter mood, perception, and cognitive functions in the human brain. They include drugs such as LSD, magic mushrooms, ayahuasca, MDMA, and peyote [1]. The US has a long and complex history with these drugs, and the resulting criminalization and stigma associated with them have kept psychedelics in the shadows for many years. However, a major shift in society\u2019s opinions of psychedelics is taking place, and a reawakening is happening in the scientific community. Researchers from various disciplines are becoming increasingly interested in unlocking the therapeutic powers of these compounds, especially for those who are diagnosed with mental disorders and are resistant to the treatments that are currently available for them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Whether or not the world is ready for it, the psychedelic renaissance has begun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Psychedelics have been used by Indigenous communities around the world as part of their cultural, spiritual, and healing traditions for thousands of years. In the Western world, psychedelics were rediscovered in the 1940s by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann, who accidentally absorbed LSD through his skin while conducting tests for a potential medicine [2]. What followed was an \u201cuninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes, with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colors\u201d [7]. Once LSD was disseminated throughout the world, psychologists began to experiment with it as a psychotomimetic, or a drug that mimics psychosis, in hopes of gaining a better understanding of schizophrenia and similar mental disorders [2, 3]. In the 1950s, as a result of the US government\u2019s fear that communist nations were using mind control to brainwash US prisoners of war, the CIA carried out the top-secret project MK-Ultra, drugging even unwitting subjects with psychedelics in an attempt to learn about potential mind control techniques [4]. Recreational use of psychoactive substances proliferated in the counterculture movement of the 1960s, eventually leading to their criminalization and status as Schedule 1 drugs [5]. This classified them as substances with no medical value and a high potential for abuse\u2014two descriptors we know are not factual [6].\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, people seem to be reevaluating their outlook on these formerly demonized drugs and are instead looking for ways to harness psychedelics\u2019 medicinal properties for mental and physical improvement. Momentum is building quickly. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Clinical trials are beginning to show real potential in the use of psychedelics for the treatment of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, eating disorders, and emotional suffering caused by diagnosis of a terminal illness.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved the use of ketamine for therapeutic purposes with MDMA and psilocybin set to follow [7]. Psilocybin has also been decriminalized in cities across the US and was completely legalized for medical use in the entire state of Oregon in November 2020. Entrepreneurs and investors are flocking to startups such as MAPS Public Benefit Corporation and Compass Pathways, which are currently developing psychedelic drugs for therapeutic application. Research centers have been cropping up across the country as well, even at prestigious institutions like John Hopkins School of Medicine and Massachusetts General Hospital.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So how do psychedelics work? In truth, scientists still don\u2019t know exactly what happens to neural circuitry under the influence of these mind-altering drugs. While more research is required to fully understand how psychedelics affect the brain, there are some findings that help clarify this mystery. For example, the major group of psychedelics\u2014called the \u201cclassic psychedelics\u201d\u2014closely resembles the neurotransmitter serotonin in terms of molecular structure [8]. This group includes psilocin, one of the important components of magic mushrooms; 5-MeO-DMT, which is present in a variety of plant species and at least one toad species; and LSD, also known as acid [8]. What they all have in common is a tryptamine structure, characterized by the presence of one six-atom ring linked to a five-atom ring [8]. This similarity lends itself to a strong affinity between these psychedelics and serotonin receptors in the cerebral cortex, particularly the receptor 5-HT</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2A</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [8]. The implication of this is that psychedelics can have a significant and widespread influence on brain chemistry, given that serotonin is one of the main neurotransmitters in the brain and plays a major role in mood regulation [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What follows is a poorly understood cascade of effects that causes disorganized activity across the brain [10]. At the same time, it seems that the brain\u2019s default-mode network gets inhibited. British researcher Robin Carhart-Harris recently discovered this by dosing study participants with either psilocybin or LSD and examining their neural activity with the help of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Rather than seeing what most people expected\u2014an excitation of brain networks\u2014Dr. Carhart-Harris found a decrease of neuronal firing in the brain, specifically in the default-mode network. According to Michael Pollan, author of the best-selling book on psychedelics </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How to Change Your Mind</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, this network is a \u201ctightly linked set of structures connecting the prefrontal cortex to the posterior cingulate cortex to deeper, older centers of emotion and memory.\u201d Its function appears to involve self-reflection, theory of mind, autobiographical memory, and other components that aid us in creating our identity. In other words, the ego\u2014the conscious sense of self and thus the source of any self-destructive thoughts that may arise\u2014seems to be localized in the default-mode network. This network is at the top of the hierarchy of brain function, meaning it regulates all other mental activity [10].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Therefore, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">when psychedelics enter the system and quiet the default-mode network, suddenly new and different neural pathways are free to connect, leading to a temporary rewiring of the brain</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [10]. In many cases, this disruption of normal brain functioning has reportedly resulted in mystical, spiritual, and highly meaningful experiences. Psychedelics facilitate neuroplasticity, thereby helping people break negative thinking patterns and showing them\u2014even temporarily\u2014that it\u2019s possible to feel another way or view something from a different (and more positive) perspective.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This kind of experience can be immensely helpful to someone who is struggling with a mental health disorder and needs a brain reset. While other techniques, such as meditation and general mindfulness, can help cultivate a similar feeling, they require much more time and effort, something that is not always feasible\u2014and never easy\u2014for those who are severely struggling with their mental health [10]. Psychedelics can help jump-start the process of healing, and their effects can be made even more powerful and long-lasting when coupled with psychotherapy [11]. Talking with a psychiatrist or psychologist after the drug treatment can help integrate and solidify a client\u2019s newly acquired thinking patterns [11].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in April 2021, researchers found that psilocybin works at least as well as leading antidepressant escitalopram [12]. In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, fifty-nine participants with moderate-to-severe depression took either psilocybin or escitalopram, along with a placebo pill in both cases. After six weeks, participants in both groups exhibited lower scores on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology\u2013Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16), indicating an improvement in their condition. The difference in scores between the two groups was not statistically significant, meaning that a longer study with a larger sample size is still required to show if there is an advantage to treating depression with psilocybin over conventional drugs [12]. However, one notable difference was that psilocybin seems to take effect faster than escitalopram [13]. As an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), escitalopram takes a couple months to work, something that\u2019s not helpful for those with severe depression. Psilocybin, then, is suggested to provide more immediate relief to people battling depression [13].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In June 2020, a team of researchers at John Hopkins published a meta-analysis of nine clinical trials concerning psychedelic-assisted therapy for mental health conditions such as PTSD, end-of-life distress, depression, and social anxiety in adults with autism [14]. These were all the \u201crandomized, placebo-controlled trials on psychedelic-assisted therapy published [in English] after 1993.\u201d The psychedelics in question included LSD, psilocybin, ayahuasca, and MDMA. Following their statistical meta-analysis of these trials, they found that the \u201coverall between-group effect size at the primary endpoint for psychedelic-assisted therapy compared to placebo was very large (Hedges g = 1.21). This effect size reflects an 80% probability that a randomly selected patient undergoing psychedelic-assisted therapy will have a better outcome than a randomly selected patient receiving a placebo\u201d [14].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There were only minimal adverse effects reported from this kind of therapy and no documentation of serious adverse effects [14]. When compared to effect sizes of pharmacological agents and psychotherapy interventions, the effects of psychedelic-assisted therapy were larger, especially considering the fact that participants received the psychedelic substance one to three times prior to the primary endpoint, as opposed to daily or close-to-daily interventions with psychotherapy or conventional medications. Overall, results suggest that psychedelic-assisted therapy is effective\u2014with minimal adverse effects\u2014and presents a \u201cpromising new direction in mental health treatment\u201d [14].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At UC Davis, researchers in the Olson Lab recently engineered a drug modeled after the psychedelic ibogaine [15]. This variant, called tabernanthalog (TBG), was designed to induce the therapeutic effects of ibogaine minus the toxicity or risk of cardiac arrhythmias that make consuming ibogaine less safe. TBG is a non-hallucinogenic, water-soluble compound that can be produced in merely one step. In an experiment performed with rodents, \u201ctabernanthalog was found to promote structural neural plasticity, reduce alcohol- and heroin-seeking behavior, and produce antidepressant-like effects.\u201d These effects should be long lasting given that TBG has the ability to modify the neural circuitry related to addiction, making it a much better alternative to existing anti-addiction medications. And since the brain circuits involved in addiction overlap with those of conditions like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, TBG could help treat various mental health issues [15].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the psychedelic industry begins to emerge, members of the psychedelic community are voicing their concerns about the risks that come with rapid commercialization</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [7]. Biotech companies, researchers, and therapists should be careful about marketing psychedelics as a casual, quick fix to people\u2019s problems. Psychedelics can occasion intense and profound experiences and should be consumed with the right mindset, setting, and guidance. There are still many unknowns about psychedelic use, especially its long-term effects. Not all individuals should try treatment with psychedelics, especially those with a personal or family history of psychosis. It will also be important to move forward in a way that is respectful to Indigenous traditions and accessible to all people\u2014particularly people of color\u2014without letting profit become the main priority. Some advocates worry that commercialization and adoption into a pharmaceutical model might strip psychedelics of their most powerful transformational benefits and that they will wind up being used merely for symptom resolution [7]. As long as psychedelics\u2019 reintroduction to mainstream medicine is handled mindfully, the world may soon have a new avenue for effective mental health therapy that honors its Indigenous heritage and is accessible to all.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alcohol &amp; Drug Foundation.

There has been a lot of discussion surrounding the respiratory symptoms induced by the disease but less focus on how contracting the disease can result in long-term suffering. As someone who is fascinated by the brain, I wanted to investigate how COVID-19 survivors have been neurologically impacted post-recovery and what insight it can provide on more severe neurological disorders.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has drastically changed our lives over the past fifteen months. The viral disease produces mild to severe symptoms, including fever, chills, and nausea. There are individual differences in the length of recovery, typically ranging from 1-2 weeks after contraction [1]. Once recovered, those infected are assumed to be healthy and \u201cback to normal,\u201d but data shows that this is not the case for some COVID-19 survivors. COVID-19 has resulted in more severe long-term effects for patients, greatly affecting their ability to perform daily tasks. Taking a deeper look into the neuroimmunological side effects of COVID-19 can help explain the long-term symptoms experienced by survivors.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Developing our knowledge of long-term neurological effects on COVID-19 survivors is crucial in understanding the risk of cognitive impairments, including dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A team led by Dr. Alessandro Padovani at the University of Brescia recruited COVID-19 survivors with no previous neurological disease or cognitive impairment for check-ins six months after infection [3]. The exam assessed motor and sensory cranial nerves and global cognitive function. The results showed that the most prominent symptoms were fatigue, memory complaints, and sleep disorder.\u00a0 Notably, these symptoms were reported much more frequently in patients who were older in age and hospitalized for a longer period of time [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other symptoms reported include \u201cbrain fog,\u201d a loss of taste or smell, and brain inflammation [2]. Researchers hypothesize that the virus does not necessarily need to make its way inside neurons to result in \u201cbrain fog\u201d but instead claim that it is an attack on the sensory neurons, the nerves that extend from the spinal cord throughout the body to gather information from the external environment. When the virus hijacks nociceptors, neurons that are specifically responsible for sensing pain, symptoms like brain fog can follow [4].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Theodore Price, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Dallas, investigated the relationship between nociceptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein embedded in cell membranes that allows for viral entry when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to it [4, 5]. The nociceptors live in clusters around the spinal cord, which are called dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Price determined that a set of DRG neurons did contain ACE2, enabling the virus to enter the cells. The DRG neurons that contained ACE2 had messenger RNA for the sensory protein MRGPRD, which marks neurons with axons concentrated at the skin, inner organs and lungs. If sensory neurons are infected with the virus, it can result in long-term consequences. It might not be the case that the virus is directly entering the brain and infecting the sensory neurons. Alternatively, it is the immune response triggering an effect on the brain, which leads to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier surrounding the brain [6]. While this area of research is still under investigation, studies have shown that the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and lack of oxygen to the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia.

I realized I wanted to investigate the possible solutions there were for him and others, allowing me to consequently further my knowledge about this field of study. I\u2019d love for readers to understand the complexity and dynamics that non-invasive brain stimulation therapies have on post-stroke patients, and its beneficial effects when used in conjunction with other therapies. Though studies are in their preliminary phases and there are quite a bit of unknowns, it is still important to keep in mind the innumerable therapeutics being created that target patient populations experiencing a certain extent of brain damage- their results are absolutely phenomenal.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Abstract</span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">:\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Non-invasive brain stimulation therapies have become an overwhelmingly dominant innovation of biotechnology that has proven to be greatly effective for treating post-cerebral damage. Stimulation therapies use magnetic fields that can induce electric fields in the brain by administering intense electric currents that pulse through neural circuits. Although several stimulation therapies exist, the therapies discussed in this review include the most widely used therapeutic technologies: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Post-stroke patients often experience significant impairments to their sensorimotor systems that may include the inability to make arm or hand movements, while other impairments include memory or behavioral incapacities. Stimulatory therapies have been shown to allow for certain neuronal excitability that can improve the impairments seen in these patients unlike alternative standardized procedures. Although the individual efficacies of stimulation therapies have shown viable outcomes, current research dives into how the use of stimulation therapies in conjunction with secondary therapeutics can have synergistic effects.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Introduction</span>:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Basic stimulation therapies were first put to clinical use in 1985 to investigate the workings of the human corticospinal system [1]. The magnetic field that is produced by stimulation is capable of penetrating through the scalp and neural tissue, easily activating neurons in the cortex and strengthening the electrical field of the brain [1]. By inducing depolarizing currents and action potentials in certain regions of the brain, patients with damaged areas of the cerebral cortex found great relief as they regained a degree of normal functionality in their motor, behavioral, or cognitive abilities [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In recent years, stroke has become the second leading cause of death in the United States [2]. Neurologically speaking, stroke can interrupt blood flow in regions of the brain, such as the motor cortex, weakening overall neurological function throughout the body [2]. Stimulatory therapies are used in these cases to successfully activate neurons which jumpstarts their firing capabilities and rewires the body\u2019s normal functionality [1]. Although certain reperfusion therapies using thrombolysis have been seen to treat certain ischemic (i.e. hemorrhaged) tissue in stroke patients by removing deadly clots in blood vessels, these therapeutics are often starkly inaccessible to the general population because of their price tag and scarcity [2]. Oftentimes, even standard pharmacological drugs prove ineffective [2]. By way of heavy experimentation, scientists have discovered that the brain can simply reconstruct itself through a method called, \u201ccortical plasticity,\u201d allowing for neural connections to be modified back to their normal firing pattern [3]. By understanding this innate and adaptive tool that the brain possesses, researchers invented the method of stimulatory therapies to essentially boost our own neural hardware [2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over the years, by investigating how these therapies and their mechanisms can work in conjunction with other therapeutics on post-stroke patients, an in-depth understanding of further possible advantageous therapies can be made.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mechanism of Non-Invasive Neural Stimulation</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most current noninvasive brain stimulation therapies use similar methodologies involving the induction of magnetic fields or electrical currents along cerebral cortical regions of the skull and brain to induce rapid excitation of neurons [4]. Some of the most common noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques currently used are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and theta-burst stimulation (TBS) [4]. Our brains reorganize innately after stroke or cerebral damage through mechanisms of cortical plasticity [3]. However, non-invasive stimulation therapies can stimulate cortical plasticity by quickly modulating neural connections through electrical activation for efficient neuronal and/or motor recovery after the incident [3]. According to Takeuchi </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al., </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TMS and other similar therapies stimulate the cortex through the scalp and the skull. This method positions a coiled wire over the scalp to generate a local magnetic field [4]. As these magnetic fields are pulsed and begin to enter the brain, they establish an electrical current that stimulates cortical neurons which induces a neuronal depolarization (i.e. excitation) [4]. rTMS involves a similar mechanism as TMS, but it has a greater rate of repetition of the ejected magnetic stimulation inducing a higher frequency current [5]. Meanwhile, TBS therapy is a modification of rTMS. While TBS has a similar degree of frequency to rTMS, TBS involves larger bursts of magnetic stimulation rather than small, frequent action [6].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When understanding the degree that noninvasive brain stimulation works on cortical neural plasticity, it is best to see its functionality in the motor cortex</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">one of the most easily damaged regions of the brain in stroke patients [4]. Neuronally, NIBS can excite the damaged hemisphere allowing for an increase in activity of the opposite or \u2018ipsilesional\u2019 motor cortex [4]. This excitement is highly inducible and is required for proper motor learning and functioning in normal human behavior [7,8]. In addition, these therapeutics may also induce certain metabolic changes that stimulate our innate neural plastic network for successful post-stroke motor recovery [4]. Over time, and with continuous electric stimulation therapy, long-term potentiation of our neural hardware can lead to swift recovery of the affected hemisphere [3]. By this method of magnetic stimulation on damaged cortical regions of the brain, post-stroke patients can recover faster than ever before.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Excitability of Motor and Behavioral Neural Networks\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ultimately, NIBS treatments induce excitability of motor and behavioral neural networks that allow for the atrophy of affected cerebral regions and increase neural plasticity in the region [5]. In a study led by Delvaux </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al., </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TMS therapies were used to excite changes in the reorganization of motor cortical areas of post-stroke patients [9]. Scientists investigated a group of 31 patients that experienced an ischemic stroke in their middle cerebral artery which led to severe hand palsy [9]. The patients were clinically assessed with the Medical Research Council, the National Institutes of Health stroke scales, and Barthel Index on certain dates of experimentation after stroke [9]. From the data collected, when damaged regions were measured by electrical motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, the areas were initially statistically smaller than the unaffected areas, thus indicating a lesser degree of motor activation resulting from the effects of certain damaged regions of the brain [9]. After the affected regions were treated with focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (fTMS), a specific type of TMS therapy, the stimulation ultimately induced excitability of affected motor regions as well as unaffected motor regions due to the inducible nature of connected regions in the brain [9]. This study evaluates a TMS technique involving MEP amplitude measurements and FDI motor maps unique to most other stimulatory therapies, including rTMS, tDCS, and others, helping to physiologically understand the impacts of neurological damage in the brain. Although the study hosted a relatively small sample size of twenty participants, it\u00a0 can be considered sufficient as per the extremity of the experimental design and scarcity of possible participants. The study participants, ranging between 45 and 80 years old, were tested for any underlying neurological disorders to reduce confounding factors. By testing these participants using a standardized scaling method and MEP potentials, the study qualified as a well-regulated results-directive for a conclusive study despite a relatively small sample size.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A similar study conducted by Boggio </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> further investigated the effects of NIBS on motor and behavioral neural networks by using variant-charged (anodal (+) and cathodal (-)) current stimulations on stroke patients and then identifying enhanced results</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The investigation studied a specific brain stimulatory therapeutic (tDCS) on its excitability and potential benefits on post-stroke patients [7]. Investigators were able to test the motor performance and improvements in stroke patients using two experiments [7]. Experiment 1 was conducted during four weekly sessions using sham (controlled magnetic stimulation), anodal (increased magnetic stimulation), and cathodal (decreased magnetic stimulation) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) therapies [7]. In Experiment 2, five daily sessions of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">only</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> cathodal tDCS treatments were investigated on affected brain regions [7]. The effects were reported following the procedure and blindly evaluated using the Jebson-Taylor Hand Function Test, a standardized test to measure gross motor hand function [7]. Between the two experiments, the most significant motor and behavioral improvements were found using the three stimulations in Experiment 1 [7]. However, when stimulations were compared individually, viable motor functional improvement was still evident with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">either </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cathodal </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">or</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> anodal tDCS on unaffected and affected hemispheres respectively when compared to the sham tDCS therapy [7]. Using daily sessions instead of weekly was found to be more beneficial in terms of lasting treatment results [7]. Investigators were able to conclude that their findings show strong support in relation to other tDCS research on motor function improvement in stroke patients [7]. tDCS is considered safe, representative, and inexpensive allowing for the possibility of further research on the technique with a wider range of patients. The study could have included additional evaluations of the different motor capabilities rather than just focusing on the hand itself to allow for variation, additional variables, and details that could supply the research rather than simply validating the technique. Both experiments analyzed above resulted in statistically significant results and represented the excitable capabilities of stimulatory therapies currently used for post-stroke patients.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Effectivity of Alternative Neural Therapeutics in Conjunction with NIBS Therapies\u00a0</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although standard NIBS therapies have been shown to provide impressive solutions for post-stroke patients, there have been few studies understanding the prospects of using NIBS in conjunction with other therapies for these patients. Aphasia, a rapid decline of the ability to acknowledge or express speech, is a common neurological disorder often seen in post-stroke patients as a result of damage to speech and language control centers of the brain [10]. A number of therapeutics not only search for solutions to certain post-stroke motor dysfunctionalities, but also the behavioral dysfunctions of stroke including aphasias. For several years, previous studies have investigated the use of intonation-based intervention (melodic intonation therapy (MIT)), on severe non-fluent aphasia patients showing immense benefits [10]. A study conducted by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vines</span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. (2011) expanded on these findings and implemented this therapy of MIT alongside an additional brain stimulatory therapy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to understand if there are augmented benefits of MIT in patients with non-fluent aphasia [10]. Six patients with moderate to severe non-fluent aphasia underwent three days of anodal-tDCS therapy with MIT and another three days with sham-tDCS therapy with MIT [10]. The two types of treatments were separated by one week and assigned randomly [10]. The study showed that compared to the effects of the sham-tDCS with MIT therapies, the anodal-tDCS with MIT led to statistically significant improvements in the patients\u2019 fluency of speech [10]. The study was able to solidify that the brain can properly reorganize and heal damage to its language centers through combined therapies of anodal-tDCS and MIT thus revamping the neurological activity of non-fluent aphasia patients [10]. However, one important component that was lacking in this experiment was a large number of subjects for reliable results. With six patients in the study, scientists could have increased the number tested to allow for greater sufficiency and valid results. Although this study lacked in size, it did include a range of participant ages relieving confounding effects of age-related neurological differences.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An additional study important to the investigation of understanding the prospects of conjunctive stimulatory therapy was conducted in 2012 by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Avenanti</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The study sought to understand the possible benefits of combining non-invasive brain stimulation therapies (rTMS) with physical therapy. Many studies have investigated the effects of TMS alone on chronic stroke patients but few have investigated the combination of TMS with physical therapy.\u00a0 In a double-blind, randomized, experiment, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Avenanti</span> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (2012) investigated a group of 30 patients who were given either real or sham transcranial magnetic stimulations (rTMS) either before or after physical therapy (PT) [5]. The outcomes of this experiment were evaluated based on dexterity and force manipulations of motor control [5]. The results of the study found that overall, patients that were given real rTMS treatments developed statistically better behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes when used in conjunction with PT but were more greatly enhanced when stimulated before physical therapy in a sequential manner [5]. Improvements were detected in all conjunctive groups (real or sham/before or after PT), and even with PT alone in certain experimental groups [5]. Researchers were able to conclude that treating chronic stroke patients with motor disabilities with rTMS </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">before</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> PT provided optimal results of motor excitability, though its conjunctive outcome was effective as well [5]. With statistically significant results, the study indicates valid conjunctive benefits of both PT and rTMS therapy for the patients evaluated [5]. Regarding the reliability of this study, each method was properly implemented for results to be sustained allowing for proper controls in sham trials [5].\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conjunctive therapies offer new insight into possible avenues for advantageous treatments for post-stroke patients rather than when used alone. With new investigations in this field of study, unknown outlets are slowly being uncovered, allowing for better solutions to cerebral and ischemic damage.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) therapies are a well-refined and successful therapeutic for post-stroke patients. Although much of the mainstream solutions to damaged cerebral regions are NIBS therapies, current research is still searching to identify qualifying conjunctive therapies with NIBS to ameliorate treatments. Standard stimulatory procedures use measurable magnetic or electric currents to depolarize or excite regions of the brain to stimulate neurons for proper activity. By doing so, our innate system of neural plasticity works with this stimulation to enhance the recovery of damaged cerebral regions. In recent years, scientists have taken a step further and combined stimulatory therapies with additional stroke therapy to further enhance results. Although early research processes have begun, more studies and trials are necessary to provide for sufficient data to strongly confirm their efficacies, even when promising results have already been found. Several studies lack the number of participating patients, data, and resources needed to successfully prove these conjunctive therapies. Further understanding of these treatments through repeated trials, larger sample sizes, and statistically significant results may lead to a better understanding in the future of possible effective conjunctive treatments for post-stroke patients.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Santos MD dos, Cavenaghi VB, Mac-Kay APMG, Serafim V, Venturi A, Truong DQ, Huang Y, Boggio PS, Fregni F, Simis M. 2017.

        "title": "The Relationship Between Itch and Pain in Itch Pathways",
        "author": "Nathifa Nasim, Neurobiology, Physiology & Behavior \u201822",
        "date": "09/03/2021",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Itch is not a stranger to any of us, but growing up with eczema, I have always been hyper aware of it. As far back as I can remember, burning hot showers and painful levels of scratching temporarily alleviated the maddening sensation of itch without my understanding of how pain was linked to itch. Once I joined the Carstens Lab studying the relationship between itch and pain, these memories were rekindled, and I became interested in not only understanding itch, which we know so little of, but how these two sensations interact. This paper was also written for my UWP 104E class.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Itch is an everyday sensation that nearly all people have experienced. Its origins lie in its role as a defense mechanism \u2014 when faced with irritant stimuli, the scratching urge produced by itch can remove potentially harmful substances [1]. However, despite its evolutionary advantages, itch is often a source of discomfort and for many can dramatically impact their quality of life. Itch not only includes acute itch such as mosquito bites, but debilitating chronic itch can stem from different diseases such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, liver/kidney failure, atopic dermatitis, and other skin disorders [2]. However, despite the widespread impacts of itch, much of its mechanisms and pathways still remain elusive.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Itch is a somatosensory sensation, relying on the nervous system for detection and perception, therefore similar to other somatosensory sensations such as heat, touch, vibration, and most importantly, pain. Pain and itch have an antagonistic relationship, meaning each sensation has an opposing effect on the other. This is evident in \u201cpainful\u201d scratching which relieves the feeling of itch, and that morphine administration reduces pain while increasing itch [3]. The intersection between the two sensations translates to potential treatment as well: chronic itch, for example, can be treated by medications similar to chronic pain [2]. Researching the interplay between itch and pain can help illuminate the pathophysiology of itch and how it is perceived as a sensation different from pain, and consequently lead to a better understanding of treating itch.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, there are numerous models and theories proposed to explain this overlap, however, there is no consensus amongst itch researchers on which model(s) may best explain the relationship between pain and itch. This review will be an overview of the various models of itch transduction and perception and how they have evolved with the accumulation of new research. It will also cover the basic mechanisms of itch at the level of the periphery and spinal cord and how it interacts with pain.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Overview of Itch Mechanisms</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Itch Activation at the Level of the Epidermis</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pruriceptors are neurons capable of detecting itch; these can be activated by either mechanical stimuli, a scratchy fabric for instance, or chemical stimuli, such as poison ivy. For simplicity, and as the chemical pathway is currently better understood, the paper will focus on chemical itch from here onwards. Similar to other somatosensory neurons, the cell bodies of the primary pruriceptive neurons reside in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), close to the spinal cord, with axons stretching to both the periphery and the spinal cord [4, 5]. Unlike other sensory modalities, itch is specific to the outermost epidermis only, as opposed to pain, which can be felt in the muscle and bone. The pruriceptors\u2019 branched sensory nerve endings which terminate in the epidermis are studded with membrane receptors activated by various \u201citchy\u201d mediators [4]. The receptors differ in the mediators they respond to but can be broadly grouped into histamine receptors, serotonin receptors, G Protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), toll-like receptors (TLRs), or cytokine and chemokine receptors [4,5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once acute itch is triggered by an irritant, keratinocytes, mast cells, and immune cells release chemical mediators which trigger vasodilation, inflammation, and the arrival of more immune cells to clear the irritant. The chemical mediators can include histamine, serotonin, proteases, cytokines, and chemokines, each of which is associated with a certain receptor [4]. The activation of itch from internal factors in disease differs from acute itch in that it is instead dependent on unknown mediators in the bloodstream from drugs or diseased organs [4]. Despite the origin of the chemical mediators, however, once released they bind to the receptors on the free nerve endings and activate them. The receptors then depend on various ion channels to depolarize the pruriceptor neuron which conveys the sensory information to the spinal cord via its axon [4, 5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Itch Transmission to the Spinal Cord</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The pruriceptive DRG neurons\u2019 axon also ends in the spinal dorsal horn. These then synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord which connect to projection neurons that carry the sensory information to the brain. The interneurons are important for transmission as well as modulation of itch via excitatory and inhibitory synapses [4, 5, 6]. Electrophysiological responses to itch stimuli in primates have identified the projection neurons as belonging to the spinothalamic tract, which carries axons to the thalamus. This tract also conveys pain and temperature and is consequently an area of itch interaction with other modalities [5, 7]. In addition to interneurons, descending modulation in the spinal cord can also regulate itch. After applying a cervical cold block to mice \u2013 activity of the upper cervical spinal cord level was essentially stopped \u2013 mice were unable to relieve itch and decrease neuronal firing when the lumbar spinal cord neurons below were stimulated by an itchy substance. This suggests that there is some level of descending modulation that was disrupted when the upper spinal cord was damaged [8].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Areas of Itch and Pain Interaction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having briefly discussed the pathways for itch perception, it is important to note how often it converges with that of pain. Firstly, pruriceptors are in fact pruriceptive </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">nociceptive </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">neurons, meaning they are a subset of nociceptors, or pain-sensitive neurons. Although there are many non-pruriceptive nociceptors (neurons sensitive to pain but not itch), studies have pointed towards most pruriceptors being stimulated by pain as well as itch [1, 2]. One method of explaining this convergence is the expression of TRPV1 ion channels in pruriceptors. Although these are important for detecting itch, it is also expressed in nociceptors, and is stimulated by the classic pain stimulus found in peppers, capsaicin [4].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The relationship between itch and pain continues to the spinal cord. As mentioned, the spinothalamic tract (STT) is of special interest in understanding the distinction between itch and pain, as both sensations traverse the same pathway. Transecting the anterolateral funiculus where the tract ascends has eliminated sensitivity to itch, pain, and temperature, establishing the common usage of the tract by these sensations [6]. Electrophysiological recordings of primate STT neurons when given different types of sensory stimuli also revealed that two thirds of the nociceptors were sensitive to itch stimuli as well as pain, again highlighting the apparent overlap between itch and pain in the spinal cord [9].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The relationship between itch and pain is best understood as antagonistic. Recordings of STT pruriceptive neurons showed that after being stimulated by histamine (itch/pruritic stimuli) the neuronal firing decreased </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">when the skin was scratched. However, the same neuron increased firing after scratching in response to capsaicin. Although being activated by both pain and itch stimuli, the difference in response to scratching suggests an antagonistic relationship between pruriceptive and nociceptive neurons via inhibitory interneurons [6].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The intersection between pain and itch raises the question of the brain\u2019s perception of pain and itch as distinct in the presence of much overlap. There are numerous theories and models attempting to explain the nature of this relationship, which will be overviewed in the following sections.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Classical Models of Itch and Pain Discrimination</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Intensity Model\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Given observations on the overlaps between itch and pain, itch was first theorized to be a subset of pain in the intensity model. This postulates that polymodal neurons (sensitive to many modalities) differentiate between itch and pain through patterns of firing or \u201cintensity\u201d due to weak or strong stimulation [1, 4, 6, 10]. The model was tested by delivering electrical pulses to the skin that varied in frequency. Although the results seemingly disproved the theory as it only increased the intensity of itch felt, rather than transforming it to pain, the theory has not yet been discounted [6]. Itch stimuli has been shown to trigger lower firing rates compared to painful stimuli in both peripheral and STT neurons, suggesting that firing rates do have some role in itch perception [6, 9]. Furthermore, both itch and pain stimuli give rise to \u201cbursting\u201d patterns of action potentials, and the interburst interval is shorter in response to capsaicin/pain. This suggests some level of temporal coding, when information is coded based on the timing of action potentials or intervals between them. This aligns with the intensity model as a polymodal neuron could code for itch and pain depending on the rate of action potentials or their intervals [9].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The intensity model\u2019s basic principle lies in neurons activated by both pain and itch, and seemingly aligned with the previously mentioned research identifying pruriceptors as a subset of nociceptors and activated by both pain and itch. However, the discovery of itch-specific neurons further complicated the validity of the model, lending support to the labeled line model instead.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Labeled Line or Specificity Theory</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Labeled line refers to the idea that there exists a specific, separate \u201cline\u201d or neural pathway devoted to the sensation of itch \u2013 the opposite of the intensity model\u2019s polymodal neurons. As early as the 1800s, researchers discovered there are specific spots on the skin which are activated by different sensory modalities: coolness, heat, pain, etc., giving rise to the labeled line theory. Recent electrophysiological studies have supported this for different sensations through establishing the presence of sensory fibers and spinal relay neurons tuned to only one sensory modality [11].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The labeled line theory\u2019s validity for itch was confirmed by the presence of itch specific neurons. GRPR3+ neurons in the spinal cord were identified that differed from STT neurons in that they carried purely itch information [3, 12]. This was evident as when these neurons were treated with a toxin, not only was there loss of itch behavior (scratching), there was no change in pain behavior (wiping) [12]. The discovery of these itch specific neurons was emphasized by the consequent discovery of MrgprA3+ neurons in the dorsal horn which were itch specific as well; their deletion also resulted in loss of itch behavior only [7]. Furthermore, the neurons gave rise to purely itch behavior regardless of the nature of the stimulus \u2013 precisely as predicted by the labeled line [7]. These discoveries gave significant support to the labeled line theory, yet the presence of itch neurons activated by pain remained a dilemma.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Modified Models of Itch and Pain</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The theories of intensity and labeled line represent the two ends of the spectrum in understanding pain signalling \u2013 the first depends on polymodal neurons, and the latter on itch specific neurons. The discovery of neurons that fall under both complicate their validity, and suggest that an accurate model should include neurons sensitive to both itch and pain while capable of differentiating between the two [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spatial Contrast Model</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spatial models expand on the intensity model, and do not require itch and pain specific neurons. It proposes that itch is felt in \u201cspatial contrast,\u201d or when a small population of nociceptors are activated, and pain is felt when a larger population is activated due to a stronger stimulus [6,10]. In a study, it was observed that a spicule (small pointed end) of both histamine (itch stimuli) and capsaicin resulted in itch sensation, yet an injection of only capsaicin resulted in pain activation [13]. This could be explained by the spatial contrast theory in that the spicule activated a small number of nociceptors, resulting in itch, whereas the more widespread injection stimulated a larger number of nociceptors, resulting in pain.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the model, a small number of even non-pruriceptive nociceptors activated should result in itch, eliminating the need for a labeled line. However, there remains an obstacle in this model as well \u2013 there was no decrease of itch sensation relative to pain when the area of exposure to stimuli increased, although the model predicts this should in theory activate a greater number of receptors [6, 13].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Selectivity Theory and Population Coding\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The population coding theory \u2013 also known as the selectivity theory \u2013 modifies the labeled line, proposing that although there are specific sensory labeled lines, the antagonistic interaction between them shapes perception of itch. It takes into account the overlap between nociceptors and pruriceptors as well as pain\u2019s inhibition of itch, proposing that pruriceptors are a smaller subset of nociceptors and are linked to them by inhibitory interneurons [1,11]. Theoretically, activation of the larger nociceptive population \u2013 including pruriceptors \u2013 is felt as pain, as the activation of the pain neurons \u201cmasks\u201d the sensation of itch. Yet if only the smaller itch specific subset is activated, this is felt as purely itch, as there is no activation, and consequently no inhibition from the nociceptive neurons [1, 11, 14].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There have been numerous studies that appear to support this hypothesis. In one, the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 was deleted from DRG nociceptive neurons, affecting their ability to signal. This resulted in spontaneous itch in mice along with a decrease in pain behavior and, importantly, itch behavior resulting from capsaicin injections [14]. These results were paralleled in another study where blocking pruriceptors had no effect on pain, yet deleting TRPV1 in a group of nociceptive neurons led to capsaicin to be perceived as itch [15]. These two studies suggest groups of nociceptors are involved in inhibiting and masking itch, as deleting their receptors results in itch signaling instead, supporting the population coding theory.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is also necessary to identify an inhibitory neuron to explain the antagonistic relationship between the nociceptors and pruriceptors; Bhlhb5 neurons are one such interneuron. When Bhlhb5 was knocked out in mice, there was increased itch behavior that ultimately resulted in lesions from itching and licking [16]. This suggests that the interneuron, and perhaps other interneurons as well, are responsible for inhibiting and regulating itch, further bolstering the support for the population coding model.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gate Control and Leaky Gate Model</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The gate control theory hypothesizes that nociceptive transmission neurons in the spinal cord receive input from both nociceptive primary neurons, and A\u03b2 fibers: primary neurons attuned to non-nociceptive stimuli such as touch. These A\u03b2 fibers in turn inhibit the nociceptive neurons via interneurons, effectively creating a \u201cgate\u201d that can halt transmission of pain or itch [10]. The previously mentioned Bhlhb+ interneurons support this gate control model as well [10, 16].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This model was recently further refined into the \u201cleaky gate\u201d theory. This builds on the intensity theory and modifies the gate control theory by substituting Grp+ neurons in the role of A\u03b2 fibers. Grp+ spinal cord neurons receive strong input from pain sensory neurons and weak input from itch specific neurons, coding for itch in an intensity dependent manner and inhibiting pain. This model is different from gate control in that it lets weak pain signals \u201cleak\u201d through while suppressing strong pain signals to prevent an overwhelming pain sensation. When strongly activated by pain, these interneurons inhibit pain, whereas due to weak activation from itch, it does not inhibit pain [10]. This model is able to explain the phenomenon that itch is often accompanied with a prickly, burning pain: it proposes that itch is not strong enough to inhibit pain sensation, resulting in a weak pain sensation accompanying itch [10].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A few of the major theories of itch perception have been discussed in an attempt to illuminate how itch is attenuated by the presence of pain in an inverse relationship. The intensity theory and the labeled line theory are both supported by the presence of polymodal neurons and itch specific neurons, respectively. However, given their opposing views, the accuracy of both theories is undermined by support for the other; this indicates the need for a model that is able to reconcile itch specificity with neurons attuned to both itch and pain.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The following models attempted to ease the apparent discord between the two previous models.\u00a0 The spatial model expands on the intensity model while providing a possible mechanism by which pain and itch could be felt from the same population of neurons. On the other hand, the population coding model expands on itch specific neurons of the labeled line while accommodating the inverse relationship between itch and pain. Lastly, the leaky gate model combines aspects of both intensity and selectivity theories.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These theories attempt to explain itch and pain crosstalk; the importance of understanding this relationship is seen in both acute and chronic itch pathophysiology in cases of crosstalk dysfunction. The previously discussed Bhlhb+ neurons are a prime example of the consequences of impaired itch and pain interaction [2, 16]. Research has shown that knocking out these interneurons \u2013 thereby severing the connection between itch and pain \u2013 results in chronic itch-like behavior such as lesions from scratching [16]. This suggests that chronic itch may result from uninhibited, unregulated itch when pain is no longer permitted to suppress itch [2, 16].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This example highlights the importance of the application of the interaction between pain and itch. Not only does understanding the intersection between the two sensations provide a better understanding of itch mechanisms, the very intersection itself has an important role in itch pathophysiology, of which there is much that is still unknown. With the advent of new discoveries of new aspects of the itch pathway, these current models will continue to develop.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patel KN, Dong X. 2010.

As I began learning about various types of imaging sensors, calcium ion (Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) indicators, in particular, stuck out to me due to their variety and depth of development. As I am unable to take part in in-person projects due to COVID restrictions, to ensure my understanding of the topics I was reading about, I began to write this review.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Methods of performing neuroscience research have progressed remarkably in recent years, providing answers to many different types of questions. Genetically encoded indicators (sensors) are of particular interest for use in answering questions about neural circuits, cell specific populations, and single cell dynamics. These indicators modulate their fluorescence in different cellular environments and allow for optical observations. Of the various cellular activities that can be measured by genetically encoded indicators, the dynamics of calcium ions (Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) are of interest due to their fundamental importance in neuronal signaling. In this review, we introduce the basic underlying features of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) including characteristics of fluorescence, an overview of GECI engineering, and a brief discussion of some common variants of GECIs and their uses.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Modern neuroscientists have found many ways to analyze the information-carrying neuronal circuits and dynamics within the brain. The continued development of genetically encoded optical indicators, specifically Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> indicators, is particularly promising for analyses of single neurons or neural circuits. Optical fluorescence imaging allows large populations of neurons to be examined simultaneously and avoids major damage to the cells of interest [1]. In particular, measuring the dynamics of Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">can be useful in inferring spiking activity in neurons, as Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is involved in neuronal action potentials. In this review, we will introduce the basic workings of genetically encoded sensors beginning with a ground-up introduction of fluorescence measurements and the process of engineering genetically encoded sensors. Several Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> indicators will be briefly discussed in order to examine recent progress and how this can impact future studies of the brain.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mechanics of Fluorescence Indicators</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fluorescence imaging is a valuable tool for visualizing populations of cells. It is relatively non-invasive; but, in order to use optical tools to study the cortex, some surgical procedures must still be performed. A cranial window might be installed in the animal to shine light through; alternatively, an endoscope or fiber optic cable could be installed at the desired depth within brain tissue [2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fluorescent proteins (FPs) internally form a barrel-like structure containing the chromophore (also known as the fluorophore), which is a trio of amino acids responsible for the protein\u2019s fluorescence.\u00a0 The chromophore is autocatalytically formed as a post-translational modification, requiring just atmospheric oxygen. Genetically encoded indicators rely on a change in the chromophore environment within the labeling FP. Fluorescence is observed when light of an appropriate wavelength excites the chromophore\u2019s electrons, which then results in the emission of a lower energy photon as the excited electrons return to a lower energy state. FPs are often connected to sensing domains, which induce the change in the chromophore environment after detecting the event of interest (e.g., Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">binding for GECIs). Any number of cellular activities may induce a conformational change such as changes in pH or the binding of a ligand. Sensors can have one or two FPs with partially overlapping fluorescence spectra. Single FP-based sensors are generally preferred as indicators; the green fluorescent protein (GFP), cloned from the jellyfish </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aequorea Victoria,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0 is the most commonly used FP for single FP sensors [3]. In systems with two FPs, a F\u00f6rster or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs. FRET involves an energy transfer from the higher energy (more blue-shifted) donor FP to the lower energy (more red-shifted) acceptor FP. Genetically manipulating FP systems by circularly permuting FPs (fusing the original termini of the FP and introducing a new opening closer to the chromophore) can improve their performance in sensors by making the chromophore more accessible to the outside environment and, thus, more susceptible to environmental changes [4]. FPs like GFPs are also typically oligomeric in their natural environment (i.e. multiple copies stick together); but, in order to help prevent breakdown and allow for better combination with sensing domains in indicators, FPs must also be mutated to become monomeric [5].</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3939 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 222px) 100vw, 222px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr1-222x300.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr1-200x270.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr1-222x300.png 222w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr1-400x540.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr1-600x811.png 600w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr1.png 718w\" width=\"222\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1: A Jablonski diagram that visualizes an electron\u2019s excitation to a higher energy level by absorption of a photon and subsequent fluorescence emission with energy decay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To image fluorescent systems, we can use fluorescence microscopy with one or multiple photons (Fig. 2) [2]. In one-photon systems, the fluorophore absorbs energy from a light source and is excited by a single photon. Some energy is lost non-radiatively (without light) resulting in the emittance of lower energy, visible photons from the fluorophore. One-photon systems are relatively inexpensive and fast but can only penetrate tissue to a shallow depth. In contrast, multi-photon microscopy shows more promise for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">imaging because of its reduced out of focus emission, light scattering, and phototoxicity. The combination of the energy of multiple photons is required for excitation in such systems.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3938 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"290\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr2.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr2-200x264.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr2.png 220w\" width=\"220\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 2: A diagram outlining the setup for a standard fluorescence microscopy experiment.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Genetic encoding of sensors</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To introduce indicator genes into a system, methods like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in utero</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> electroporation or viral vectors can be used [6, 7]. DNA promoters or localization sequences can be used to target specific subtypes of neurons in organisms to produce transgenic animals. Transgenic animal genomes that have been modified by artificial bacterial chromosomes, CRISPR, or effector nucleases, and are particularly useful when longitudinal and intensive sampling is required. Genetic changes can be maintained throughout an animal\u2019s lifespan and lines of transgenic animals can be bred for further testing [2]. A recombinase system administered via viral vector, like the popular Cre/loxP system, can be used to achieve high specificity [6]. In the Cre/loxP system, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">loxP </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">sequences are placed at specific target sites of genomic DNA. The Cre-recombinase</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">protein can then target </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">loxP </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">sequences to modify the genetic sequence. Two mouse lines, one carrying the gene of interest flanked by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">loxP </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">sequences,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and the other line expressing Cre-recombinase, can be bred to produce mice expressing the gene of interest. The Cre Driver mouse line expressing Cre-recombinase</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">can be designed to only express the gene under certain conditions. To apply Cre/loxP to genetically encoded indicator systems, a viral vector injects the indicator genes into the brain cells of a Cre Driver mouse. The indicator is only expressed where the Cre-recombinase is active. Expression would continue through one animal\u2019s lifetime; to create a line of mice that express the desired indicator, other methods must be used [6]. Through recombinase methods, the development of transgenic animal lines is an area of active improvement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are several advantages to genetically encoding indicators over other methods of imaging. There are a wide variety of neuronal events that can be observed by constructing indicators from proteins that respond to cellular events, including changes in neurotransmitter concentrations, transmembrane voltage, Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> dynamics, and pH [1]. Genetic encoding also allows for selective sampling of cells based on genotype. Selective sampling is not possible with chemical dyes, nor is the viewing of the evolution of neuronal dynamics during learning or development processes [8, 1]. Similar to chemical dyes, genetically encoded indicators allow for the imaging of brain activity in neurons </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vitro </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and in animals [9]. Neurons have the machinery implanted within them to automatically report cellular dynamics of interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are several different broad classes of genetically encoded indicators that are based on the dynamics of the action potential [7]. Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) operate based on the membrane depolarization that occurs during action potentials. Other indicators, like pH and neurotransmitter sensors, detect vesicular release. Genetically encoded pH sensors (GEPIs) react to the decrease in acidity as vesicles fuse with the membrane, and genetically encoded transmitter indicators (GETIs) are used to visualize the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse [1]. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) operate based on the rise in cytosolic Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> during an action potential; however, they do not directly measure spiking activity. When an action potential occurs, Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> floods into the cell. Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">influx is important because calcium ions are crucial for the release of neurotransmitters from vesicles, which then go on to produce signals in other neurons. More mild calcium ion dynamics are always present in neurons, even in a resting state. Among these various classes, GECIs have been perhaps some of the most developed of these indicators and, thus, some of the most promising.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Engineering genetically-encoded calcium indicators</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Performance Criteria</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As GECIs are engineered, many performance criteria must be considered. Tradeoffs often occur between the various important qualities of an indicator\u2019s performance [10]. As we optimize the indicator to produce a desired result in one criterion, another criterion often decreases in quality. Thus, development of sensors optimized for specific applications is continuous. Some of these criteria are affinity, sensitivity, kinetics, localization, and photophysical characteristics.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Affinity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, represented as the dissociation constant K</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, describes what percentage of the indicator is unbound given a particular concentration of ligand.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Specificity </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">refers to the indicator system\u2019s ability to respond only to the target of interest, as opposed to perhaps similar molecules.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sensitivity </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is usually represented by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u0394F/F</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the fractional fluorescence change, which is the fluorescence signal change over a change in concentration of the target molecule. It can also be represented by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the relative difference between the signal of interest and background noise.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kinetics </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is the rate of change in fluorescence intensity of the indicator in response to the change in ligand concentration. There tends to be a tradeoff between affinity and kinetics [8].</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Photophysical qualities </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">like brightness, photostability, and photoswitching behaviors are also important considerations. In general, brighter or more intensely emitting indicators are desired. Photostability is inversely proportional to the rate of photobleaching (the damaging of the FP so that it becomes unable to fluoresce). Additionally, some indicators have broader ranges of excitation than others, or may change their intensity or sensitivity in different light conditions, which would limit usage.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GECIs are some of the most widely used genetically encoded indicators </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">because of their relatively high SNR and improved properties like brightness, photostability, and dynamic range [2]. However, there are still numerous obstacles to be faced in designing GECIS, and only certain variants have faced success </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Engineering GECIs</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genetically encoded indicators generally are composed of an analyte-binding (sensing domain) and a fluorescent protein (reporting domain), though there are additional peptide complexes that assist in changing the conformation of the system [2]. Upon the occurrence of a sensing event, the sensing domain undergoes a conformational change which, in turn, induces a conformational change in the FP, resulting in fluorescent activity. Engineers of GECIs use two different strategies for constructing reporting domains: FRET-based indicators and single FP-based indicators [7]. When Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> binds to FRET-based indicators, the spatial relationship between the donor and acceptor FPs changes so that there is a transfer of energy from the donor FP to the acceptor FP [2]. One family of indicators, Cameleon, has had some success. In this family, the sensing and peptide complex is located between two FPs with overlapping spectra. FRET-based indicators\u2019 SNR tends to be lower, meaning it is harder to isolate the activity of a neuron from background noise. Because of these drawbacks, we mostly examine the engineering of the more commonly used single FP-based GECIs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are two popular designs among developers of single FP GECIs [8]. One is based on one of the earliest lines of calcium indicators, GCaMP. GCaMP consists of a circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) inserted between the Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">-binding protein, calmodulin (CaM), and another peptide called RS20, which binds CaM upon Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">binding. When CaM binds Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a conformational change is induced in the cpGFP and the sensor fluoresces [10, 11]. Another recent design, the NTnC family of indicators, inserts a calcium-binding domain into a split FP [8]. Unlike GCaMP-type indicators, NTnC indicators display an inverted fluorescence response upon calcium binding (i.e., fluorescence decreases upon Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">binding). They are less optimized than GCaMP variants, but it is hypothesized that their lesser Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> binding capacity would\u00a0 interfere less with normal calcium dynamics.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3940 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr3.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr3-200x121.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr3-300x182.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr3-400x243.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/09/freed-doerr3.png 404w\" width=\"404\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 3: A basic representation of the GCaMP structure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There have been efforts to expand the color variants of GECIs. In particular, there has been much effort to develop red-fluorescing GECIs because longer red wavelengths reduce phototoxicity and have better tissue penetration [12]. However, there have been many obstacles to producing red-fluorescing GECIs. Unlike GFP, inserting calcium binding domains into red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) disrupts folding and chromophore maturation [8]. A more popular design choice is to replace the GFP in a GCaMP-style indicator with an RFP and optimize the sensor for a new FP [1].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GECIs are improved iteratively through directed evolution and linker optimization between the cpFP and the sensing domains. Site-directed mutagenesis can be used to mutate specific locations to produce novel variants. In the development of one variant of GCaMP, mutations were specifically introduced in the calcium-binding domain-cpGFP linker in a GCaMP5 scaffold to increase sensitivity [11].\u00a0 Using\u00a0 directed evolution, mutations are randomly introduced. Then, upon testing for desired effects, the variants that produced the best results may be preserved and propagated. This process may repeat many times, producing increasingly successful indicators as the best-performing mutations survive across generations.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genetically encoding indicators, as a rule, comes with challenges. If we choose to use viral infection as our genetic encoding scheme, consideration must be taken to the many viral serotypes, which have varying levels of efficiency and can be toxic. Furthermore, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in utero </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">electroporation can be unpredictable, and transgenic animals may not express indicators at sufficiently high levels to be useful [1].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sensors may affect the natural dynamics of their measured systems, affecting accuracy of results. GECIs, particularly GCaMP-based designs, may interfere with regular Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> dynamics and gene expression [8]. This interference is likely due to interactions between the calcium-binding sensing domain with native proteins and the lack of availability of calcium once bound to the indicators. There have been efforts to improve and modify the calcium-binding domain so that it can bind fewer Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> or otherwise improve affinity so that the indicator operates at lower concentrations of calcium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is also difficulty in using these indicators </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[2]. Especially in the mammalian brain, the SNR is highly decreased due to the amount of background noise. This reduced SNR is putting aside the level of breakdown that naturally happens </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">vs. conditioned, cultured environments. Although many indicators have improved structural integrity </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, there are many that still cannot be used in living organisms.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Progress in GFP-based GECIs</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There has been much development in the GCaMP series as variants are continuously improved by site-directed mutagenesis and computational design efforts [2]. The jGCaMP7 series, built from the GCaMP-6 series, provides a good example of optimization of indicators for different purposes: jGCaMP7f is optimized for fast kinetics, jGCaMP7s is optimized for high sensitivity (though it has slower kinetics), and jGCaMP7b is optimized to have a brighter baseline fluorescence [11]. All of these indicators are based on the same base scaffold but differ drastically in performance because of just a few mutations in the CaM-binding peptide, the GFP, the CaM domain, or the linkers between domains.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Progress in RFP-based GECIs</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">RFP-based GECIs have important advantages over GFP-based ones. Beyond the importance of color variety in tracking distinct populations of cells at once, red GECIs are also promising for reducing phototoxicity and allowing deeper imaging [12]. There are many promising RFP-based GECIs being developed, though they are generally dimmer than GFP-based indicators and may display photobleaching behaviors under blue light [1]. In particular, there are R-GECO1 variants like jRGECO1a, the RCaMP series, and, perhaps most promising, K-GECO1 [12]. There are three widely used RFPs from which red GECIs are developed; each red indicator family was generated from different RFPs. K-GECO1 has shown particular promise as it works at a distinct spectral range, allowing researchers to simultaneously work with other indicators in multicolor imaging experiments, and it also shows minimal fluorescent noise [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Designs of red GECIs often expand on the GCaMP design\u2013for example, K-GECO1 follows a similar design of sandwiching the circularly permuted FP between the Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">-sensing domain, CaM, and a CaM-binding peptide [12]. Switching the GFP in GCaMP with an RFP comes with engineering challenges of linker optimization and preventing the breakdown of the sensor. The increased penetrative depth of red GECIs has been used to image subcortical areas like the hippocampus or medial prefrontal cortex relatively noninvasively, demonstrating the applicability of GECIs in neuroscience research [13].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are other FP-based GECIs in development, but of particular interest is the development of near-infrared GECIs, whose spectral distinction from other indicators would help prevent photoswitching when used with optogenetic tools [8, 14].</span></p>\n<p><h4>Uses and Applications</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The applications of GECIs are varied and powerful. The use of genetically encoded indicators allows for the analysis of cells of a specific type or subpopulation as they select for specific genetic qualities. The first transgenic mouse line expressing GCaMP2 in the cerebellar cortex was generated in 2007 and has allowed for characterization of certain synapses [6]. GECIs have been used to provide single-cell resolution to the decades-long study of various topographic maps in the brain and to track the communication of neural circuits [2]. In rats, GECIs have been used to monitor neural population behavior during motor learning tasks and observe the response of cells to sensory deprivation in the primary visual cortex after retinal lesion. They allow examination of ensemble and single cell-scale neural events at more and more temporally precise levels. Broadly, and perhaps more importantly, they are often used in conjunction with optogenetic and other experimental methods that allow for the inference of causation. In using these indicators, the stimulation techniques used in optogenetic experiments can also involve precise tracking of calcium or other dynamics in cells of interest [8]. These experimental approaches have caused excitement as they allow for the examination of behaviors of cells or whole organisms upon physical stimulation of even just single cells. The continued expansion of these approaches is promising.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many researchers are devoted to developing new and distinct calcium indicators based on existing indicator series. With more GECIs than ever available to neuroscientists, there is some challenge in choosing which is best suited to the exploration of a particular question. With the continuing development of mouse lines and methods of genetically encoding more potent indicators with high temporal resolution, GECIs will continue to be an increasingly important tool within the neuroscientist\u2019s toolkit that allows for population or single-cell imaging with greater resolution than ever before.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lin M, Schnitzer M. 2016.

Finding an intersection between neuroscience, technology, and linguistics is critical to broaden speech therapy treatment. I hope readers will be excited by the possibilities that advancements in neuroscience have in healthcare.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Forms of \u201clanguage\u201d are found in many kinds of species. This suggests an innate desire for communication and a neural predisposition to do so. The human brain is specialized for spoken language, such that acute damage or acute stimulation to language processing areas can modulate a person\u2019s fluency of speech. From having a heart-to-heart with a good friend, chatting with a local barista, or updating your doctor on your symptoms:</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">verbal communication mediates a casual relationship between your inner world and the outer one</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Wants, needs, worries, and tiny little things you just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">have</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to get off your chest can be articulated without second thought.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, imagine being stripped of the ability to communicate with the outer world. An individual\u2019s increasing forgetfulness or tendency to stumble over their words might not be indicative of normal cognitive decline as a result of aging. Instead, subtle decreases in fluency might be symptoms of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">aphasia: a common and incurable language disorder, usually an effect of underlying brain damage. People with aphasia are perfectly intelligent and cognizant, but are limited in their ability to read, speak, and understand language.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aphasia affects almost 2 million Americans; nearly a third of those who experienced a stroke develop aphasia because of damaged language processing areas in the brain [2]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aphasia refers to language impairments that disrupt the ability to access ideas and thoughts through language; it does not disrupt the ideas and thoughts themselves.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The onset of aphasia is associated with brain damage, developed concurrently with a disease like Dementia or following an injury like a stroke. Patients with aphasia may have trouble verbalizing their thoughts in several ways: jumbling words together, speaking gibberish, substituting one word for another, poor grammar, speaking in short sentences, trouble retrieving words or names.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gradual yet consistent symptom improvements are typically nurtured by a speech language pathologist. To increase working vocabulary, common speech therapy techniques include conversational therapy, word finding, and naming tasks during weekly or bi-weekly sessions over the course of months or years. Although prior research in stroke patients suggest that increasing duration of sessions, sessions per week and the number of weeks of speech therapy are best for improving speech, the inconvenience and cost is a significant impediment to its implementation [3]. So how can people learn and retain more linguistic information at a faster rate? This is where neuroscientists enter the conversation. Non-invasive brain stimulation can mimic and amplify the effects of activities we regard as \u2018mentally stimulating.\u2019</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Non-invasive imaging technology can pinpoint brain areas associated with speech impairments, and applying acute electrical current triggers neural changes associated with language learning. The neural changes as a result of therapy can be observed either through functional neuroimaging, like fMRI, revealing the areas of activation, or by quantifying changes in brain structure, in the number and volume of fiber bundles in processing areas [4]. Neural connections, or synapses, are the physical mechanism of learning. When synaptic connections become vulnerable due to the applied electrical currents, having higher neuroplasticity, learning occurs most rapidly. Often neuroplasticity is cited in the context of infants whose brains develop at an incredible rate. However, any experience, task, or event will modify the connections in your brain. Therefore, artificially increasing neuroplasticity through electrical brain stimulation amplifies the effects of a learning experience. It is unclear whether brain stimulation induces true \u2018learning\u2019, or the reactivation of dormant, inaccessible information [4].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the context of aphasia, brain stimulation is paired with conventional speech therapy tasks to accelerate the rate of language improvements. Brain stimulation can be performed at little cost to patients, typically through transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS involves placing two electrodes on the surface of the scalp and sending a small electrical current to the brain.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4099 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"358\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/03/unnamed.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/03/unnamed-200x140.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/03/unnamed-300x210.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/03/unnamed-400x280.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/03/unnamed.png 512w\" width=\"512\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1: Two electrodes placed at the surface of the scalp deliver a small electrical current. Common targets are language processing centers Wernicke\u2019s area and Broca\u2019s area.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The process is completely non-invasive, described by patients as a tingly feeling. tDCS treatment is in the experimental stages for other types of disorders where brain abnormalities are relatively localized and widely researched, including depression and anxiety.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Neuroscientists have identified and experimented with tDCS to major language processing areas in the brain, where damage is linked to aphasia</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Within the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus, \u2018Broca\u2019s area\u2019 is primarily responsible for speech production. Damage to Broca\u2019s area causes trouble naming and may restrict speech to short, ungrammatical sentences. Research in stroke patients shows combining tDCS to Broca\u2019s area with word-repetition tasks improves accuracy in speech production, while conversational therapy enhances picture, noun, and verb naming [2]. Likewise, \u2018Wernicke\u2019s area\u2019 in the Superior Temporal Gyrus is associated with speech comprehension. Predictably, impairments to Wernicke\u2019s area cause deficits in understanding others\u2019 speech and writing. Researchers found the combined stimulation of this area and speech therapy improved verbal comprehension. While Broca\u2019s and Wernicke\u2019s area have been thoroughly investigated, several studies have used MRI to locate brain damage before experimenting with the application sites of tDCS. Other studies have applied tDCS to unconventional brain areas with mixed effects. Stimulation to the cerebellum has enhanced spelling ability, while stimulation to the primary motor cortex improved naming ability on trained words [5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The effectiveness of tDCS is verifiable through controlled clinical trials. \u2018Sham-tDCS\u2019 acts as a placebo: it produces a tingling sensation in the scalp without affecting neural functions, leading patients to believe they were receiving true tDCS. In many instances, the groups receiving sham-tDCS showed some improvements, although not as significant as the group receiving true-tDCS. This could be attributed to effective speech therapy tasks themselves or a mild placebo effect. Regardless, the superiority of the treatment group was exacerbated over time: after 6 months the sham-tDCS group showed a significant decrease in the initial improvements made [5]. This suggests tDCS not only promotes learning but is important for long-term maintenance.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scientists\u2019 understanding of the short-term and long-term impacts of tDCS, the specifications of the treatment, and how exactly speech therapy modifies the brain is growing. Unanswered questions remain about the parameters and expected outlook for the treatment. What is the best combination of speech therapy tasks and stimulation sites? How many sessions of tDCS are necessary? How long should electrical current be applied for? What kind of results should be expected? How should you expect conversational ability to change?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tentative answers to these questions establish tDCS as a feasible supplement to speech therapy. Knowledge about brain structure and linguistic function create an interdisciplinary approach to aphasia treatment.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Modern treatments like tDCS are enabled by technology and mitigate the time and cost barrier of intensive speech therapy</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Healthcare workers and neuroscientists, and patients might benefit from investigating how to make brain stimulation a mainstream treatment for aphasia.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chomsky, N. \u201cOn the Biological Basis of Language Capacities.\u201d In </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Neuropsychology of Language: Essays in Honor of Eric Lenneberg,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> edited by R.W.
