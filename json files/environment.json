This winter every part of the world except the eastern United States reported record breaking high temperatures. Although political agreements have been made to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the effects may be too slow as levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases continue to rise. This is especially important as populous countries, such as China and India, become increasingly industrialized and consequentially raise their greenhouse gas emissions. <span id=\"more-121\"></span>Previous studies done on alternative climate engineering options \u00a0have considered the climate under varying conditions and thus have not been comparable. In contrast, the study hosted at GEOMAR used the same basic Earth system and predicted changes for all of the possible solutions. They chose to test five common climate engineering techniques: the reduction of incoming solar radiation, afforestation of large desert areas in North Africa and Australia, and three techniques to increase oceanic carbon dioxide uptake. Afforestation is the establishment of a forest where there were previously no trees, in contrast to reforestation, which involves planting trees in areas that have been clear-cut.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, only the continuous reduction of solar radiation was successful at keeping temperatures from rising significantly. Suggested large-scale means of accomplishing this are atmospheric aerosols or mirrors in space. Other options, such as afforestation, actually led to higher temperatures because the Earth would become darker and could hold more heat. The researchers suggested that whether any of these methods are feasible could easily become insignificant if there is no political agreement. For example, in 50 years if the sun\u2019s rays are no longer blocked, climate change would occur much more rapidly and with devastating consequences as organisms will not be able to adapt. Overall, research is not close enough to a solution for how to reverse climate change, and we are left with reducing our own greenhouse gas production.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Journal Reference:</p>\n<p>David P.

Maybe not, according to a recent paper published in the Proceedings in the National Academy of Science. The study proposes that intensifying livestock production by transitioning from pure grazing to mixed systems\u2013where animals are fed high-energy food like grains\u2013could reduce livestock greenhouse gas emissions by 23% by 2030. Currently, livestock account for 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, so such a reduction would be significant.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a comment piece that appeared in <i>Nature</i> last month calls for increasing grazing to make livestock systems more sustainable. Of eight strategies that the authors outline to reduce the environmental and economic costs of raising livestock, \u201cFeed animals less human food\u201d is number one.</p>\n<p>Why is there such a stark disagreement? It comes down to the issue of land use. Most of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by livestock comes not from the animals themselves, but from deforestation. Pasture-raised animals require land, and since demands for meat and dairy have been steadily increasing, more and more land has been converted to pasture to raise livestock. In the tropics especially this has led to considerable loss of forests. So, the logic goes, reducing the calories that animals get from grazing by supplementing higher energy feed would reduce the environmental impact of livestock. According to the authors of the PNaS article, \u201cThis means that more livestock can be raised on less land, and with fewer emissions per pound of meat or milk produced.\u201d</p>\n<p>But growing that feed has an environmental cost too. Feeding animals human food is inherently inefficient in an energy sense, since only a small portion of the calories an animal takes in through food gets converted into calories in its meat. By grazing ruminants\u2013animals like cattle, sheep, and goats that can digest tough fibers that are inedible to humans\u2013we can gain access to more calories.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019ve found the perfect system for sustainable livestock yet. There are too many factors\u2013not just greenhouse gas emissions and land use, but pollution caused by animal waste, water use, food security, and of course economic sustainability. The good news is that there\u2019s plenty of work being done by researchers and farmers who want to help find solutions.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, should we go for grass-fed or grain-fed? I find the grazing argument more convincing, but you\u2019ll have to read the articles to decide for yourself. One thing that the authors of both papers agree on: the impact on the environment would be lower if we all ate less meat and dairy.</p>\n<p>Read the original articles:</p>\n<p>http://www.pnas.org/content/111/10/3709</p>\n<p>P.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>To some, the phrase climate change evokes images of dry lakes, melting icebergs, and rising oceans. However, the effects of global warming are not simply cataclysmic geological changes. There are links between all biotic and abiotic features of an ecosystem. Unsurprisingly, climate change has an immense impact on frog populations around the world. Home range, abundance, breeding cycles, pathogen epidemics, and physical degradation in frogs are all affected by the changing climate.</p>\n<p><i>Agalychnis annae</i>, the blue-sided tree frog, is a poster child for the effects of climate change on frogs. The <i>Agalychnis</i> genus, which contains five species (including the red-eyed tree frog, pictured above), lives in the canopies of the moist lowlands, mountains, and forests in Central and South America (Doha). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species lists <i>A. annae </i>as endangered with very rare sightings in Parque Nacional Tapant\u00ed and the Reserva Biol\u00f3gica Monteverde, where it was once common (IUCN). As with most frogs, it prefers moist, shady habitats that are relatively unpolluted. Frogs are sensitive to environmental change due to their highly permeable skin as well as their combined terrestrial and aquatic behaviors.(Blaustein).</p>\n<p>As with most frogs, those of the <i>Agalychnis</i> genus are carnivorous, feeding mostly on insects such as moths, beetles, crickets, and flies, as well as smaller frogs on occasion. Since frogs have three stages of life\u2013egg, tadpole, and adult\u2013and each has their own slew of predators. However, predatory hazards are not the only threats that impact <i>A. annae</i> populations. Deforestation, trade, pesticide use, destruction of breeding sites, disease, and climate changes all threaten the <i>Agalychnis</i> species (Wilson). The impact of these issues can be seen in the populations of <i>A. annae,</i> which have declined by 50% in the last 10 years and are still receding. This frog has also virtually disappeared from almost all of its historical range, and now is only found near San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica (Pounds).</p>\n<p>When discussing climate change in relation to amphibians, one might think the greatest threat would come from drying water systems, which are thought to provide these frogs with a place to live and breed. However, for the <i>A. annae</i> especially, the increased spread and breeding of pathogens, such as the chytridiomycosis fungus. Melting glaciers that create new lakes and warmer, more humid climates have expanded the territory of this once-rare disease. A recent survey in El Salvador has shown that 98% of the <i>A. moreletti </i>and <i>A. annae</i> tadpoles have malformations caused by the chytrid fungus (MARN). The warming has also meant that the fungus can now be found in higher elevations, between 1,500 and 1,950 meters.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is difficult to gauge exactly how climate change will affect these frogs in the future. Though this species has been observed to be highly adaptable, it seems the changes are happening too fast for it to keep up (Pounds). \u00a0In frogs, the two processes most affected by temperature and climate change are reproduction and development. For example, <i>A. annae</i> relies on the rainy season as a cue for a safe reproduction period (Rome).Increased temperature, increased length of dry season, decreased soil moisture, and increased inter-annual rainfall variability will affect not only individuals, but populations and even communities of frogs. If the rainy season shortens, then the temporal partitioning of spatial resources that occurs naturally between frogs of different species will decrease in efficiency as more species are forced to breed at the same time (Donnelly). <i>A. annae</i> are also known for their practice of depositing their eggs on leaves 350mm to 3m above water, where they gestate and then hatch, dropping the tadpoles into the pools below (Duellman). If temperatures increase and the dry season lengthens, humidity is expected to drop, which would provide harsh conditions for the <i>A. annae</i> eggs (Donnelly).</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, amphibians are bioindicators of environmental health and climate change due to their highly permeable skin and aqua-terrestrial habits (Blaustein). Frogs are a huge part of the ecosystem, as both predators and prey. Therefore, it is extremely important that we pay attention to their reactions to our environment. Amphibians exist in the fossil record about 150 million years before dinosaurs. They have survived the most extreme upheavals of this planet, from extinction episodes to ice ages. Now they show signs of drastic decline due to environmental factors, so it is prudent to pay attention to their plight. There already exists legislation in Costa Rica protecting the <i>Agalychnis</i> genus of frogs, including bands on illegal trade and increased protection of habitats in ecosystems (Doha). In the end, perhaps the greatest indicator that our world is changing is the resounding sound heard in affected wetlands around the world\u2013the sound of silence, as the last frog croaks.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Blaustein, A.R., Hokit, D.G., O\u2019Hara, R.K., and Holt, R.A.: 1994b, \u201cPathogenic fungus</p>\n<p>contributes to amphibian losses in the Pacific northwest\u2019, Biol.

However, California has had a long history of unpredictable weather fluctuations, and is familiar with severe droughts. Many droughts can have devastating effects, particularly in the agricultural industry and the hydropower industry. Most Californians have also experienced the effects of a drought first-hand, such as having enforced water rationing. Even though, California\u2019s history has shown that most droughts have devastating effects, droughts can also great learning experiences.</p>\n<p>The 1976-1977 drought was one of the lowest precipitation periods in California\u2019s history, but it was also a valuable learning experience,especially for the agricultural industry. During the 1976-1977 drought, statewide precipitation was ranked among the five lowest in California\u2019s recorded history (Swain). The 1976-1977 drought consisted of two years with very little precipitation, while the current drought consists of a moderately dry year, 2012, and one extremely dry year, 2013; so far 2014 has been extremely dry as well.</p>\n<p>The 1976-1977 drought is most notable for the effect it had on California\u2019s agricultural industry. The agricultural industry experienced a huge loss due to severe water shortage in 1976-1977, and currently it is experiencing another huge loss due to the current drought (Kotin, 2014). Californians were greatly influenced by the 1976-1977 drought to conserve more water, especially in the agricultural industry (Kotin, 2014). Since that particular drought, many water-saving innovations have been made in the agricultural industry, including drip irrigation. Drip irrigation became standard practice in the agricultural industry after the 1976-1977 drought because it both conserves water and saves money (Kotin, 2014).</p>\n<p>Another significant drought in California was, the 2007-2009 drought, which is one of the driest three-year periods in California\u2019s recorded history. However, the 2007-2009 drought did not have a severe impact on the agricultural industry compared to the 1976-1977 drought or the current drought, because farmers were able to cope better with the reduction in water availability. Farmers were able to rely more on local groundwater, temporary water transfers (diverting water from one area with more water to an area where there is a shortage), \u00a0changing types of crops, usually to crops that require less water, and changing cropping patterns, only keeping long-term crops (Christian-Smith, p.7). As a result of farmer\u2019s resilience, several crops, such as almonds, lettuce, and tomatoes, \u00a0even had record annual levels of production (Christian-Smith, p.30).</p>\n<p>The impact of the 2007-2009 drought on agriculture may have not been severe, but the drought\u2019s impact on hydropower production was significant; the current drought has resulted in a significant loss of hydropower as well. California hydropower production was nearly halved during the 2007-2009 drought, and within this three-year period lost hydropower was made up by the purchase and combustion of natural gas, which cost electricity ratepayers an additional $1.7 billion \u00a0(Christian-Smith, p.9). Also, this combustion of natural gas resulted in the emission of an additional 13 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere (Christian-Smith, p.85). The 2007-2009 drought highlighted the fact that many of the coping strategies used for short-term relief will not work in the long run. This gives rise to the importance of long-term water transfer programs and systems for monitoring and evaluating those transfers need to be established. Energy conservation and efficiency programs need to be expanded as well (Christian-Smith, p.86).</p>\n<p>There is no telling how long the current drought could last, which means that developing long-term strategies to cope with the drought are of the utmost importance. The cumulative reservoir shortages of 1977 were the worst in California\u2019s recorded history and there is five million acre-feet more water today than in 1977, however, there were millions fewer people, which means that the current population is experiencing the effects of the drought more severely, such as having to ration water even more per person (Water Conditions, 2014).</p>\n<p>So far, 2013 has been one of the driest years in recorded history for many areas of California. Scientists have found that atmospheric conditions associated with the current drought in California are very likely linked to human-caused climate change (Explaining, p. S11). Using a combination of computer simulations and statistical techniques, scientists showed that a region of high atmospheric pressure hovering over the Pacific Ocean, which diverts storms away from California, is much more likely to form in the presence of modern greenhouse gas concentrations (Explaining, S9). If the current drought is truly a consequence of human-induced climate change, California needs to prepare for possibility of more severe droughts to come in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_390\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a data-caption=\"Status of drought in California, October 21, 2014.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>ABSTRACT</p>\n<p>The Suisun Song Sparrow (<i>Melospiza melodia maxillaris</i>) is a subspecies of Song Sparrow that is endemic to the Suisun Marsh of California. It is listed as a state species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife due to its restricted range, small breeding population, and susceptibility to encroaching human development. The Suisun Marsh ecosystem is highly altered, and is comprised of both natural tidal wetlands and impounded wetlands that are cut off from the natural tidal cycle. Suisun Song Sparrows are believed to prefer natural tidal wetlands, but there is a lack of information on sparrow densities and habitat associations in impounded wetlands. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the abundance and habitat preferences of Suisun Song Sparrows in an impounded and heavily managed wetland complex. \u00a0We conducted surveys at seven sites within interior managed (impounded) wetlands, and seven sites along edges between tidal and impounded wetlands. We found significantly more birds in interior sites than at edge sites, but within edge habitat, abundances were higher on the tidal side of the levee. We found that Song Sparrows used tall vegetation in greater proportion than its abundance, and specifically preferred bulrush and common reed as calling perches. Interior sites contained relatively less of this preferred vegetation than edge sites, suggesting that beneficial habitat heterogeneity in interior sites, and/or deleterious edge effects along the dikes may be important drivers of abundance. In the face of sea-level rise and shifting conservation priorities, many managed wetlands are expected to be converted back into fully tidal systems, and our results provide an important baseline for future research on the effects of tidal restoration.</p>\n<p>The Suisun Marsh of California (38\u00b0 10\u2019 N, 122\u00b0, 0\u2019 W) is the largest estuarine marsh on the west coast of North America, and comprises more than 10% of California\u2019s remaining natural wetlands (CA Dept. of Water Resources 2013). Located at the terminus of the Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta, Suisun Marsh is 116,000 hectares in size, nearly half of which is privately owned and managed for waterfowl hunting habitat (CA Dept. of Water Resources 2013). Suisun Marsh is a critical stopover and wintering site for tens of thousands of waterfowl migrating through the Pacific Flyway, and provides habitat for over 221 bird species, 45 mammal species, 16 reptile and amphibian species, and more than 40 fish species (Moyle et al. 2014). Several of these are of conservation concern, including the endangered Delta Smelt (<i>Hypomesus transpacificus</i>), endangered California Clapper Rail (<i>Rallus longirostris obsoletus</i>), and a state species of special concern, the Suisun Song Sparrow (<i>Melospiza melodia maxillaris</i>), an endemic subspecies of Song Sparrow that is entirely restricted to wetlands surrounding Suisun Bay.</p>\n<p>The Suisun Song Sparrow shares genetic similarities with the Alameda Song Sparrow (<i>Melospiza melodia pusillula</i>) and Samuel\u2019s Song Sparrow (<i>Melospiza melodia samuelis</i>); however, these subspecies have non-overlapping ranges, occupy distinct habitats, and do not interbreed (Nur et al. 1997). The range of the Suisun Song Sparrow is limited to wetlands surrounding Suisun Bay, beginning at the junction of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers in the east and extending west only as far as the Carquinez Straits (Humple and Geupel 2004). Due to its restricted range, small breeding population, and susceptibility to encroaching human development, the Suisun Song Sparrow is formally listed as a species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG 2001).</p>\n<p>Suisun Song Sparrows are believed to prefer fully tidal marsh to muted tidal marsh (where natural tidal regimes are altered by dikes and water control structures) or impounded wetlands; in fully tidal marsh, nests have been documented at only 10-50 meters apart (Nur and Spautz 2002, Shuford and Gardali 2008). These fully tidal areas are dominated by homogeneous patches of tall vegetation, predominantly bulrush (<i>Schoenoplectus lacustris</i>) and cattail (<i>Typha latifolia</i>). Bulrush provides cover from predators and perches to call from, while cattail provides the seeds that make up the majority of their diet (LSA Associates 2009). Additionally, tidal cycles expose mudflats on which Suisun Song Sparrows forage for seeds (primarily from bulrush and cattail) and invertebrates (Marshall 1948).</p>\n<p>The Suisun Song Sparrow is of conservation concern because its native tidal habitat has been in decline for centuries. Gold mining in the 1800s flushed large amounts of sediment from the mountains, clogging marsh channels and drastically altering natural flow regimes (Moyle et al. 2014). The early decades of the 1900s saw vast sections of the marsh diked and leveed to create waterfowl hunting clubs, as well as the establishment of a railroad to convey wealthy hunters from San Francisco into the marsh interior (Moyle et al. 2014). The loss of natural tidal habitat has undoubtedly contributed to a decline in Suisun Song Sparrow populations, from an estimated ~300,000 birds in the 1800s (Grinnell and Miller 1944, Nur and Spautz 2002) to ~50,000 today (Shuford et al. 2008). In its current form, the marsh is a highly modified ecosystem with only 5.4% remaining as \u201cpristine\u201d tidal marsh (CA Dept of Water Resources 2013); much of the remainder is divided among the 158 duck clubs currently operating in the Suisun Marsh (CA Dept of Water Resources 2013), most of which independently manage their properties to grow seed plants (often non-native) to attract wintering waterfowl. This management strategy has resulted in extensive diking of Suisun Marsh in order to maintain the flooding regimes required by these plants.\u00a0The Suisun Song Sparrow is anecdotally known to occupy managed duck clubs, although there have been no rigorous population assessments in these privately-held wetlands.</p>\n<p>Given that duck clubs comprise over half of the Suisun Marsh, it is of critical importance to understand how threatened and declining species, such as the Suisun Song Sparrow, are using these highly modified habitats. This knowledge is all the more important given impending changes to the Marsh ecosystem\u2014chief among them are sea-level rise and shifting conservation priorities. Sea level is predicted to rise by more than 1.5 m by 2100 (Vermeer and Rahmstorf 2009), which will alter tidal regimes and create new zones of tidal wetlands. Concurrently, concern for endangered fish species has prompted conservation biologists to call for extensive restoration of tidal habitat, most of which will be restored through converting managed duck clubs into natural tidal ecosystems. It is unclear how these landscape changes will impact Suisun Song Sparrow populations, primarily because so little is known about how these birds use impounded wetlands.</p>\n<p>To address this knowledge gap, we studied abundances and habitat preferences of Suisun Song Sparrows inhabiting a managed duck club, with direct comparisons to an adjacent tidal levee. We predicted that the abundance of Suisun Song Sparrows in pristine tidal habitat would be significantly higher than the abundance of sparrows observed at sites within the interior of the managed wetlands. In addition, we hypothesized that the number of birds observed perching on tall vegetation will be significantly higher than the number of birds perching on medium or short vegetation, because tall vegetation may be used as calling perches. Knowing how birds are using managed marsh ecosystems may help us understand the effects that are likely to arise as these wetlands are converted back to tidal habitat. In fact, parts of our study site are slated for such a conversion within the next 5-10 years, making our study an important baseline assessment for this area, with broader applications to similar regions throughout Suisun Marsh.</p>\n<p>METHODS</p>\n<p>We conducted our study on a managed duck club owned by the California Waterfowl Association. The Denverton Duck Club property (38\u00b0 12\u2019 54\u201d N, 121\u00b0, 54\u2019 54\u201d W) is ~380 hectares in size, and is heavily managed as waterfowl hunting habitat. The property is fully diked-off from the tidal system: a 3-mile U-shaped perimeter levee separates the managed wetlands from the tidal wetlands which surround the property on three sides, and the flow regime is dictated by water-control structures. In the summer, interior managed wetlands are characterized by hypersaline soils, small pools of stagnant water, and highly variable types of vegetation, including tall reeds (<i>Phragmites</i>), mid-height vegetation such as mustard (<i>Brassica spp.</i>) and poison hemlock (<i>Conium maculatum</i>), short grasses such as rabbitsfoot grass (<i>Polypogon monspeliensis</i>) and saltgrass (<i>Distichlis spicata</i>), and low woody cover such as pickleweed (<i>Salicornia virginica</i>). \u00a0The Denverton property lies within the distinctive range of the Suisun Song Sparrow (Shuford et al. 2008).</p>\n<p>Our goal of this study was to compare Suisun Song Sparrow distributions between interior wetlands and habitat along the tidal levee; thus, our first step was to identify informative sampling areas. We selected seven sites in the interior of the managed wetland complex at least 100 m from the tidal levee, and seven sites along the perimeter levee that divides the managed wetlands from fully tidal habitat. \u00a0These fourteen sampling locations were separated by 200 meters or more (Fig. 1), and were characterized by representative vegetation types, soil salinities, and water regimes.</p>\n<p>We selected interior sites based on three criteria; vegetation height, vegetation heterogeneity, and accessibility. After exploring the interior managed wetlands on foot, we selected seven sites to represent the range of habitat available to Suisun Song Sparrows within the managed wetland. Five out of seven sites contained a heterogeneous mixture of vegetation species at a variety of heights, while two out of seven sites were dominated by one vegetation species (pickleweed) at a low height (this habitat type was extremely common at Denverton). Because the vegetation composition of edge habitat was similar throughout the property, and because accessibility was not an issue along the levee road, edge study sites were selected based solely on visibility and even spacing. Each site had at least 80 meter visibility on either side of the levee, and an attempt was made to select sites distributed evenly along the levee road in order to cover as much of our study area as possible.</p>\n<p>We described habitat components at all study locations using two parameters: vegetation species (or cover type such as mud, water or gravel) and vegetation height. Each site was divided into four quadrants based on cardinal directions, beginning in the Northeast quadrant and continuing clockwise. We described the habitat in each quadrant, and also noted how sparrows were using different types of vegetation (e.g. calling, hiding). In addition, we estimated the percent cover of vegetation in each quadrant out to 50 meters from the center of the study site. We estimated percent cover of individual plant species, and we also aggregated vegetation data into five categories based on height: tall vegetation (greater than one meter), medium vegetation (.5- 1m), short vegetation (less than .5 m), bare ground (gravel and mud), and water.</p>\n<p>At each of our fourteen sampling locations, we conducted daily standing point counts from 20 June 2013 to 26 June 2013 between the hours of 0530 and 0900 following standard point count protocols (Reynolds et al 1980, Scott and Ramsey 1981)(1). We selected stationary point count methods to reduce the effect of observer presence on bird behavior and to standardize the time spent at each location. During each point count, observers stood at a predetermined location and counted all Suisun Song Sparrows detected audibly or visually. We conducted our surveys at each point count station for a total of 10 minutes on a daily basis, but only recorded individual sparrows at an instant in time. This \u201csnapshot\u201d method (Buckland et al. 2001) was used to mitigate the possibility of counting the same bird more than once. After each initial observation, we tracked each bird for 60 seconds before the next snapshot in order to avoid counting the same bird twice. We used program Distance (Thomas et al 2009), to calculate population density, which accounts for biases in detection probability. To further increase our detection probability, we selected an 80 m observation radius (estimated using laser rangefinders) to ensure that observers could reliably locate and identify all birds (Reynolds et al 1980). Each time observers detected a sparrow, the type of detection was recorded as visual or auditory; thus, we included birds that were calling from within vegetation that we were not able to visually locate. We conducted surveys at each point count station for periods of 10 minutes to allow enough time to count as many birds as possible, yet avoiding the probability of having outside birds move into the study site (Fuller and Langslow 1984).</p>\n<p>With the software Distance, we used the conventional distance sampling analysis engine, in which the only covariate in the detection function is distance. The inputs that we used for this analysis were study site, number of birds observed at that site, the number of times each site was surveyed, and the radial distance at which each bird was detected. All other analyses were conducted in R 2.13, and we report means \u00b1 standard errors unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p>RESULTS</p>\n<p>To begin our analysis, we compared the number of birds occupying interior managed wetlands (core habitat well inside the levee) to the number of birds occupying edge habitat (either inside or outside the levee) (Fig. 2). We counted significantly more birds in the interior managed wetlands (8.6 \u00b1 0.7) than in edge habitat (6.1 \u00b1 0.4) (Welch\u2019s t-test, p = 0.01). These findings were supported by results we obtained using the program Distance to estimate the densities of Suisun Song Sparrows. Using Distance, we estimated densities to be 18.7 birds/hectare in the interior sites compared to only 10.8 birds/hectare on the edge sites, with a total abundance of ~390 birds in the Denverton Duck Club property. For our second analysis we focused only on the 7 edge sites, comparing the number of birds found inside the levee (managed wetland) to the number of birds found outside the levee (tidal wetland) (Fig. 3). Significantly more birds were counted outside the levee in tidal habitat (4.3 \u00b1 0.3) compared to the number of birds counted inside the levee within managed wetland habitat (2.4 \u00b1 0.3) (Welch\u2019s t-test, p &lt; 0.0001).</p>\n<p>Using the vegetation data we collected, we analyzed how often birds used tall, medium and short vegetation in proportion to the abundance of each type across our study sites (Fig. 4). Tall vegetation made up only 36% of total ground cover, but was used by 83% of birds, indicating that tall plants are highly preferred by sparrows within our study sites. Medium height vegetation covered 14% of our sites, but was used by only 2% of birds. Short vegetation covered 28% and was used by 13% of birds.</p>\n<p>Within these height categories of vegetation types, sparrows showed preferences for individual plant species. We observed birds using bulrush and common reed notably more frequently than any other plant species (Fig. 5). In proportion to their abundance, bulrush and common reed were used almost four times more often than they were found: while bulrush and common reed comprised only 9% and 8% of the total vegetation in our study sites, 35% of all birds were observed utilizing bulrush, and 27% of all birds were observed utilizing common reed. In contrast, pickleweed was twice as abundant as bulrush and cattail (covering 17% of all sites), yet it was used by only 8% of all sparrows observed.</p>\n<p>In order to determine whether Suisun Song Sparrows show any preference in using specific types of vegetation as perches from which to call (which is important in mate attraction and territory maintenance), we analyzed the number of birds that used plants of different heights and noted whether each bird was actively calling or only perching. Our results show that tall plants, such as bulrush, cattail, and common reed, are heavily used by sparrows as vantage points from which to call; the majority of birds observed on these taller plant species were vocalizing (Fig. 6). We found that 75% of sparrows found on bulrush, 74% found on cattail, and 68% of birds found on common reed were using these plants as calling perches.</p>\n<p>Our results suggest that Suisun Song Sparrows show a strong preference for tall vegetation. We counted more sparrows in interior habitat than edge habitat, but at edge sites, more birds were counted outside the levee in tidal marsh. To determine whether vegetation could be driving these differences in song sparrow abundance, we conducted two additional tests. Interestingly, we found that tall vegetation was more common at edge sites (42% of cover) than interior sites (33% of cover) (Welch\u2019s t-test, p&lt;0.003). The second analysis compared vegetation height in tidal marsh (outside the levee) to vegetation height in managed habitat (inside the levee).Within the edge sites, tall vegetation covered 50% of the tidal marsh side of the levee , but only 31% of the managed wetlands side (Welch\u2019s t-test, p = 0.06).</p>\n<p>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p>The Suisun Marsh is a highly altered ecosystem that provides critical habitat to both wintering waterfowl and endemic species of conservation concern. Historically, these have been viewed as competing goals because waterfowl habitat is created by diking the marsh to create highly managed impoundments, which interrupts the natural tidal regimes that are important to endemic species. Sea-level rise and shifting conservation priorities will likely mandate that many waterfowl clubs be converted back to natural tidal systems in the coming decades; thus, understanding how species currently use these managed wetlands is critical to be able to predict the outcome of tidal restoration. In this study, we found significantly more birds in interior sites, despite the fact that edge sites generally had taller vegetation (which song sparrows prefer).</p>\n<p>Because habitat heterogeneity is higher in interior sites, it is possible that the birds are utilizing the mixture of plant types and heights in the diked wetland for an array of activities, and thus prefer these interior sites. For example, we found that Suisun Song Sparrows prefer tall vegetation as perching sites while singing, yet pickleweed, which is low, is the third most used plant in the marsh after bulrush and common reed. Birds seen on shorter vegetation are less vocal, implying that birds use shorter plants for reasons other than vocal communication (e.g. refuge from predators, foraging). Furthermore, higher densities of birds in the interior habitat may be due to reduced edge effects in the core habitat. Birds in the interior may experience decreased disturbance from the levee road, decreased predation rates, and decreased exposure to intense weather such as high heat and wind (reviewed in Lahti 2001). Furthermore, the higher number of sparrows in the interior wetlands could be due to the shift of some breeding pairs from tidal habitat to diked wetlands late in the season in order to avoid flooding with the May and June high tides (Goals Project 2000, Johnston 1968).</p>\n<p>When we considered only (non-preferred) edge sites, we observed more birds on the tidal side of the levee as compared to the managed wetland side of the levee, which is in accord with other studies on this species (Shuford 2008). On the edge, the vegetation in the tidal area was consistently taller than on the managed wetland, so we suggest that birds occupying the edge habitats prefer to be in the taller vegetation because it provides a better refuge from predation, wind, and human disturbance. This preference for tall vegetation could also be due to the presence of cattail and bulrush seeds, the Suisun Song Sparrow\u2019s preferred food source (Marshall 1948). Additionally, because birds often call from the tall vegetation more common in tidal habitat, we may have been more likely to detect them. Conversely, the managed side of the levee has more short vegetation, mud and water. Birds tend to not use these cover types for calling, which presumably reduces their detectability.</p>\n<p>Nur et al. (1997) showed that song sparrow densities were higher where there was more vegetation, but concluded that song sparrows do not use habitat in a selective manner. However, our results suggest that song sparrows use common reed, bulrush, and cattail in greater proportion than their availability. More generally, taller vegetation seems to be preferred, especially for perching and calling.</p>\n<p>Overall, our study shows that Suisun Song Sparrows are relatively abundant in the interior of managed duck clubs compared to sites along a tidal levee. From a conservation perspective, this suggests that the interior of managed wetlands may be an important resource for the Suisun Song Sparrow, though it remains unclear whether managed wetlands are as attractive as pristine tidal habitat (Shuford et al. 2008)(2). Many duck clubs will persist in the coming decades, and will most likely be managed to benefit waterfowl; indeed, the San Francisco Bay Estuary provides winter habitat for 50% of most species of diving ducks utilizing the Pacific Flyway (Moyle et al. 2014). Thus, conservation biologists must find commonalities between the needs of migratory waterfowl and the needs of endemic species, such as the Suisun Song Sparrow. For example, both waterfowl and song sparrows benefit from exposed mudflats for foraging, and so managing for muted tidal flows in some areas may be beneficial to many species of birds (Larsen 1989). The Suisun Marsh ecosystem is likely to change dramatically in the next several decades: sea level rise will drown large areas of existing tidal marsh (Houghton et al. 2001, Orr et al. 2003) and many duck club levees will be breached to create new tidal marsh. Our results provide a baseline understanding of how Suisun Song Sparrows use managed wetlands, and set the stage for future studies examining the relative use of pristine tidal versus managed wetlands, and how these birds respond to tidal restoration.</p>\n<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p>\n<p>This study began as an undergraduate class research project at UC Davis, and would not have been possible without the guidance of Dr. John Eadie, Dr. Peter Moyle, and Denise de carion. \u00a0We are also deeply indebted to the California Waterfowl Association for hosting this class on their Denverton property, and to Robert Eddings for extensive logistical support throughout this project. \u00a0DF, JFH, and OG would like to thank their teaching assistant, KMR, for his enthusiasm and support in seeing this project through to publication. \u00a0All funding was provided by UC Davis, and the authors have no conflict of interest to declare.</p>\n<p>1\u00a0 We acknowledge the limitations of a small sample size collected towards the end of the breeding season; nevertheless, these are some of the first data collected on Suisun Marsh Song Sparrows inhabiting managed duck clubs, and potentially provide important baseline information on which future studies can expand.</p>\n<p>2\u00a0Unfortunately, logistical constraint prevented us from adequately sampling pristine tidal habitats.</p>\n<p>LITERATURE CITED</p>\n<p>Buckland, S.T., D.R.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>Pierce\u2019s Disease in grapevines is a major threat to California\u2019s viticultural economy. Caused by the bacterial strain <em>Xylella fastidiosa, </em>the disease blocks water transfer in the xylem of stems, leading to water stress and eventual death. Until the 1990s, the only carriers for the disease were native Blue-Green Sharpshooters, <em>Graphocephala atropunctata</em>. However, between 1994 and 2000, a devastating outbreak occurred in Southern California, destroying more than 1000 acres of vineyards (Ringenberg et al., 2014). This epidemic was caused by a new nonnative vector- the Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter, <em>Homalodisca vitripennis</em> (Tumber et al, 2013). Compared to the Blue-Green Sharpshooter, the Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter has a much greater capacity to spread Pierce\u2019s Disease because it can fly further and feed on a larger variety of plant parts (Alston et al., 2013, Baccari and Lindow, 2010).</p>\n<p>Transmission of <em>Xylella</em> in grapevines occurs in the water-conducting xylem tissue inside the vine stem (Ringenberg et al.,2014). Sharpshooters feed on this tissue and water loss to the plant may occur but the fruit remains undamaged in non-infected plants (Tumber et al., 2013). When the <em>Xylella</em> bacteria make contact with a vine stem, through the saliva of an infected sharpshooter, it blocks the xylem by attaching to the walls and producing biofilms (Navarrete and De La Fuente, 2014). This biofilm is a form of growth in which bacteria cells aggregate in an adhesive polysaccharide matrix and attach to the xylem surface, resulting in reduced water transport and prolonged water stress (Bi et al., 2007). A few weeks after grape xylem has been infected with <em>Xylella</em>, vines show symptoms of chronic water depression including: leaf chlorosis, marginal scorching, fruit shriveling, and vine dwarfing (Navarrete and De La Fuente, 2014, Baccari and Lindow 2010). The <em>Xylella</em> pathogen has the ability to move both axially and radially in xylem vessels, increasing the number of colonies as the disease progresses (Baccari and Lindow, 2010). As vessel colonization increases, the plant is less able to mobilize water to its upper extremities, eventually leading to progressive water deprivation and death (Lindow et al., 2013). When a vector feeds on a plant infected with <em>Xylella</em>, the bacteria will attach to the insect\u2019s mouthparts and foregut, enabling it to continue spreading the disease as it feeds on different vines (Navarrete and De La Fuente, 2014, Tumber et al., 2013). This is an effective transmission mechanism that may lead to large outbreaks of the disease.</p>\n<p>In 2000, the Pierce\u2019s Disease Control Program was introduced in California to minimize the impact of infections (Tumber et al., 2013). Since then, more than $48 million has funded government agencies, nursery industries, and the University of California system to find a solution to <em>Xylella</em> outbreaks (Tumber et al., 2013). Current research in preventing transmission of Pierce\u2019s Disease falls into two categories, vector management and disease management.</p>\n<p><h4>Vector Management</h4></p>\n<p>Sharpshooters are the primary vectors of <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em> as they are xylem sap feeding specialists. Adult sharpshooters carry the pathogen in their foregut as a monolayer and cells are released in saliva into the plant xylem tissue during feeding (Navarrete and De La Fuente, 2014, Tumber et al., 2013, Almeida et al., 2005). The Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter is the most important vector in Pierce\u2019s Disease transmission because of its high mobility, extreme polyphagy, and wide distribution on susceptible crops (Alston et al., 2013, Baccari and Lindow, 2010, Almeida et al., 2005). As a result, vector management has become an important area of research in order to reduce incidence of Pierce\u2019s Disease. Management tactics focus on reducing the number of vectors in a large area, keeping them out of vineyards, and manipulating their interactions with grapevines (Almeida et al., 2005).</p>\n<p><em>Chemical Barriers</em></p>\n<p>One major class of vector management is chemical sprays. These include biocontrol agents such as insecticides (neonicotinoids) and repellents (Almeida et al., 2005). Insecticides rely on lethal and sub-lethal doses over time to control insect populations (Castle et al., 2005). Studies of neonicotinoid effects on Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter populations have occurred using irrigation systems equipped with injection sites (Castle et al., 2005). A statistically significant decline in sharpshooter densities was recorded over six weeks after being treated by the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (Castle et al., 2005). This treatment has been effective in reducing the density of nymph sharpshooters, however, the insecticide is not effective at keeping adult sharpshooters away from vines (Castel et al., 2005). Research has also demonstrated that spraying nearby agricultural fields may help stop the spread of adult Glassy-Winged Sharpshooters from moving onto grape plots (Prabhaker et al., 2007). Kaolin application is another well-studied method of chemical barriers. Using kaolin on grapevines creates a particle film that disrupts insect behavior (Almeida et al., 2005). In one field study, Almeida et al. found that combining neonicotinoids and kaolin resulted in a 50-75% reduction in infection incidence versus untreated controls (2005).</p>\n<p><em>Physical Barriers</em></p>\n<p>A second method of vector management involves the use of physical barriers to increase spatial distribution or to restrict vector movement. One way to increase spatial distribution is to remove infected grapevines to prevent healthy vines from being exposed to the pathogen (Almeida et al., 2005).\u00a0 This can reduce the spread of Pierce\u2019s Disease from vine to vine. However, by the time the grapevine shows symptoms of the disease, the removal of the plant may not be an effective enough method to reduce <em>Xylella</em> transmission (Almeida et al., 2005). Other physical methods have also been employed to restrict sharpshooter movements. Five-meter high screen barriers were tested as a method to reduce vector migration (Almeida et al., 2005).\u00a0 However, establishing and maintaining fences and screens can be time consuming and expensive, especially around land that encompasses thousands of acres (Alston et al., 2013). Although these physical barriers are less implemented, they manage the vectors by increasing the distance between feeding sites which reduces the ability of sharpshooters to find a continuous food supply (Yoon et al., 2014).</p>\n<p><h4>Disease Management</h4></p>\n<p>Disease management focusses on exploring ways in which <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em> can have a less severe effect on grapes. Research in this area is ongoing and trials require years of preparation and many seasons of grape harvesting in order to study the implications of Pierce\u2019s Disease. Currently, there are two major areas of disease management under investigation. These are transmission studies using diffusible signal factors and genetic trials.</p>\n<p><em>Diffusible Signal Factor Studies</em></p>\n<p>When <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em> attaches to a grapevine\u2019s xylem, it produces an unsaturated fatty acid signal molecule which has been named diffusible signal factor (DSF) (Lindow et al., 2011). The accumulation of this signal molecule suppresses the virulence of <em>Xylella</em> in grapes because it disrupts the development of cell-to-cell signaling (Lindow et al., 2011). Researchers have been able to increase the DSF levels in laboratory tests by transforming the grape with rpfF genes (Lindow et al., 2011). In one study, Lindow et al. found that grape plants possessing certain rpfF genes were much less susceptible to the <em>Xylella</em> pathogen (2011). Another study artificially elevated DSF levels in grapes and discovered that DSF accumulation is associated to regulation of motility, biofilm formation, and virulence (Beaulieu et al., 2013). Virulence is reduced because the biofilm increases in adhesiveness- greatly reducing its ability to spread throughout the plant (Beaulieu et al., 2013).</p>\n<p>New research has shown that DSF also has an influence on <em>Xylella</em>\u2019s ability to adhere to the mouthparts of sharpshooter vectors (Baccari et al., 2013). Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) bioluminescent markers, Baccari et al. demonstrated that pathogen cells with high levels of DSF are less able to attach to the sharpshooters\u2019 mouths (2013). Creating a method for artificially inflating the DSF levels in grape populations may be a significant step in reducing the infection rates of Pierce\u2019s Disease.</p>\n<p><em>Genetic Trials</em></p>\n<p>Many genetic studies surrounding the <em>Xylella </em>pathogen use transgenes from wild grape genomes. Wild grapes are not used in commercial wines because of their low quality; however, they are resistant to Pierce\u2019s Disease. The molecular basis of their resistance is still unknown. Using plasmid cloning, laboratories are trying to isolate genes from wild grapes that accounts for their lack of susceptibility. This type of research can take years to clone genes, transform DNA, and grow grape stem cells into plants. Nevertheless, experiments with transgenes are slowly progressing towards genetically modified plants that may be completely resistant to infection. In one ongoing transgene study, six anti-Programmed Cell Death genes were screened for ability to suppress Pierce\u2019s Disease, and when expressed in Thompson Seedless grape plants, two grape sequences were able to suppress symptoms and reduce bacterial levels in inoculated plants (Gilchrist and Lincoln, 2011). Both DNA sequences were found to reduce the bacterial titre to a level found in resistant wild grapes (Gilchrist and Lincoln, 2011).</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p>Pierce\u2019s Disease is a serious threat to California\u2019s $3 billion agriculture economy. The disease continues to cost California\u2019s grape and wine industries more than $104 million per year, with $50 million spent per year on infestation management (Alston et al., 2013). Fortunately the outbreak in California during the 1990\u2019s has not spread north of Temecula Valley. If the Glassy-Winged Sharpshooter manages to migrate and infest the Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley regions, California\u2019s wine industries could lose more than $185 million per year (Alston et al, 2013). In a state-wide outbreak model, Alston et al. calculated that the Napa-Sonoma regions could stand to lose more than 100,000 vines if Glassy-Winged Sharpshooters migrated north (2013).\u00a0 Decreasing the virulence of <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em> by protecting existing vines and creating transgenic plants might be the key to preventing a statewide outbreak and protecting California\u2019s wine industries.</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<p>Almeida, R., Blua, M., Lopes, J., and Purcell, A.

I was amazed at the advancements of medical technology which allow us to understand diseases and create potential cures, previously never thought possible. My purpose for writing this review is to show scientific audiences the most current research on how bacteria in the respiratory microbiome has an impact on asthma. Recently, much research initiated by the Human Microbiome Projects (HMP) proved that the bacteria living on and inside humans contribute to the health and disease of the body. This review is meant to educate scientists on the most recent information on development of childhood asthma and prompt others to conduct future research on preventative treatments for the disease.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">An uncontrollable coughing and heavy wheezing fit may seem all too familiar to those with severe asthma. Childhood asthma impacts millions of children and their families, and the majority of children who develop asthma do so before the age of five (aaaai.org). The US Department of Health and Human Services defines asthma as an inflammatory disease of the airways with generally reversible airflow obstruction and increased sensitivity of the throat muscles (Earl). \u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Asthma symptoms include: breathing problems, intense coughing or wheezing, and chronic respiratory infections</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> (Earl).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Lung tissue inflammation, due to environmental, immunological, or genetic factors, can be the cause of serious asthma (aaaai.org). However, recent studies have identified another serious cause of asthma: \u201cthe bacteria living in the nasal passages, throat, and lungs.\u201d Bacteria living in a certain area of the body is referred to as a microbiota, and its composition at each location on body is distinct (Versalovic). For example, the bacteria that live in the throat and lungs, comprising the respiratory microbiota, cannot thrive nor live in the kidneys or skin. Harmful bacteria may get trapped in the respiratory microbiota and cause an inflammatory response of the cell tissues and muscles in the throat and lungs (Versalovic). A better understanding of the disease has been reached due to new medical insights that have linked respiratory microbiota during infancy to the development of severe childhood asthma and chronic breathing problems later on in life (Teo).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The formation of a microbiota occurs during an infant\u2019s first year of life, similar to how an immune system develops. The immediate surroundings have a large impact on the baby because both the good and bad bacteria will essentially colonize inside and outside the body. It is common for many infants to get sick or develop respiratory infections, often from harmful microbes, or tiny bacteria, that get trapped in the part of the throat that connects to the nose (Teo). Infections during infancy that spread from the throat to lower respiratory airways and lungs can lead to development of asthma later on in life (Teo). Problems such as bacterial respiratory tract infections during infancy have a strong association with worsening or increased severity of symptoms in children with asthma (Earl). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Now scientists are realizing asthma can be caused by the bacteria living in your throat. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Childhood Asthma Study (CAS), an investigation of the respiratory microbiome during the first year of life for a cohort of 234 children, correlated bacteria and asthma development. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The trial came to this conclusion by tracking infants with both respiratory infections and breathing problems and looking at their throat bacteria collected from a cotton swab (Teo). \u00a0Results showed different types of bacteria living in a healthy throat versus a sick asthma throat (ibid). The majority of all the affected children contained a harmful throat bacteria called Streptococcus (ibid). In addition, the majority of all the healthy children contained a beneficial throat bacteria called Moraxella, which was significantly absent in the sick throats (ibid). Based on this trial, Moraxella may play a protective role in the throat, and if absent, can lead to negative impacts and colonization of \u00a0harmful bacteria like Streptococcus (ibid). The harmful Strep bacteria indicates a strong asthma predictor because those infants developed mild to severe breathing problems within the next 6 months (ibid). Thus, the types of bacteria living in the respiratory microbiota can contribute to the nature of infections and inflammatory responses \u00a0seen in asthma (Earl). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), initiated in 2008, caused a surge in research about how the tiny organisms living on and inside humans can affect the body in health and disease, such as throat bacteria and its impact on asthma. Funding of this project advanced technology in order to detect and code bacterial DNA, known as genetic sequencing. In a recent pediatric asthma study, the effects of the respiratory microbiota on asthma was determined by genetically sequencing bacteria in both healthy and sick airways, and then comparing the DNA (Versalovic). Broad results showed the bacteria in asthma airways differed from bacteria in healthy airways (ibid). However, upon further investigation of the bacteria by comparing their DNA through genetic sequencing, it was determined that the harmful and beneficial bacteria were very closely related (ibid). This result signifies that such minute differences in DNA can have such a large impact on how the bacteria contributes to the respiratory microbiota, whether it be positive or negative. The results of this study indicate future research on possible asthma treatments is needed to determine how to carefully isolate harmful bacteria from the throat, without disturbing the closely related beneficial bacteria (ibid). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Asthma was previously understood as a disease due to genetic or environmental factors, however now scientists realize that it is caused by the bacteria living in your throat. The new research and biology behind the development of the disease will allow scientists to properly understand childhood asthma. The unique approach of changing or isolating the bacteria living in the respiratory microbiota as a treatment plan may impact numerous children and their families dealing with the asthma disease.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Works Cited</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cAsthma Overview.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> AAAAI, 2015.

With whole metagenomic sequencing, it is possible to obtain and analyze every piece of genetic material in the sample. As we being to learn more about the world, it becomes evident that there is more that is unknown. The crAssphage is an example of a \u201cknown unknown\u201d because through metagenomics, the virus\u2019s genome has been built and certain properties can be interpreted from the genome, but it has never been seen under a microscope and there is much still unknown about the virus. Metagenomics have opened the doors to analyzing multiple sequences and determining the ecology of the environment. Because metagenomics is becoming more prevalent, it is essential to understand the potential of this growing field. I hope that by learning about the potential of metagenomics, new ideas can sprout from using this technology in order to help others.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><h4>CrAssphage</h4><span style=\"font-weight:400\">: Bacteriophage with a circular double-stranded DNA viral genome, 97 kilobase pairs that contain 80 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). It was named after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">cr</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">oss-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">ass</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">embly analysis software used to find the viral genome.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><h4>Interest</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The crAssphage caught my attention because it was discovered very recently in 2014, and was found solely through metagenomics. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Metagenomics is the study of genetic material directly from environmental samples such as the soil or the human gut. With whole metagenomic sequencing, it is possible to obtain and analyze every piece of genetic material in the sample. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">According to Dr. Robert Edwards, who is the principal investigator of the crAssphage project, the bacteriophage is very widespread and found in every other person. It has also been on earth as long as humans have roamed (Price, 2014). This bacteriophage has never been viewed under a microscope, yet the entire genome has been constructed based on the DNA sequences found in metagenomic databases through cross assembly analysis. Dr. Edwards describes the analysis strategy as \u201cidentifying the phage in different samples, putting it together in one bucket and analyzing them as one group\u201d (Price, 2014). In other words, they identified genetic sequences that was present in all the samples, and then piece them together based on similarity. Properties of the phage and its possible hosts have been deciphered through analysis of the constructed genome. I decided to further study this bacteriophage, and find out what potential it could have in future studies.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Discovery/Identification</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the first article published about the crAssphage from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Nature Communications</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> by Dutilh </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. (2014), a team of researchers used metagenomic strategies in order to assemble the crAssphage genome, encode proteins, predict the phage-host, and determine the ubiquity of crAssphage in public metagenome databases. In order to assemble the genome, the team used an analysis strategy termed cross-assembly analysis. Fecal samples from twelve different individuals were sampled and analyzed. It was noticed that a cluster of viral DNA, about 97 kilobase pairs long (ten times larger than the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) was found in all the samples (Price, 2014; Yong, 2014). According to Dutilh </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">., around 75% of the DNA from any stool sample- and as much as 99%- won\u2019t match any of the known viral sequences in databases (Price, 2014). After checking the genome against this list, Dutilh </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. determined that the crAssphage was a new virus. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Prevalence</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The crAssphage is a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria. Interestingly, the human gut virome is dominated by bacteriophages that are mostly unknown (Minot </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">., 2013). However, it was found that the phage is widespread and abundant after searching through many public metagenomic libraries. Dr. Edwards states that the phage is very common and is likely to be in every person, if not every other person. The team of researchers predicted the host bacteria as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bacteriodetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, a common phylum of gut bacteria that live toward the end of the intestinal tract in humans, and suspect to play a major role between gut bacteria and obesity. Perhaps the crAssphage can determine the abundance of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bacteriodetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> that can be present in the human gut and have an effect on the human gut ecology. Unfortunately, it is not certain if </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bacteroidetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> is the clear host for the phage. Homology searches were done and results did not provide clear clues as to what the bacterial host(s) is for this phage. In order to determine the true host of the phage, the phage must be isolated and produced, which has not been successful so far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">No sources have mentioned if the bacteriophage is pathogenic to humans. Due to the abundance and large presence, it is not likely that the phage is dangerous to humans. Although the method of transmission is unknown, it is predicted that the phage is transmitted from mother to child (Prince, 2014). More research is needed in order to confirm what the transmission sequence is. According to Dr. Edwards, he is curious about the mechanism of entry and what the phage does to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bacteriodetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> in future studies (Price, 2014).</span></p>\n<p><h4>Future Direction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In order to study the mechanism of entry and replication of the phage, a mass amount must be made in order to perform tests. However, it is not possible if the host is not grown. Unfortunately, the crAssphage has not been isolated in order to study its mechanism of entry and replication. \u00a0Since most gut bacteria won\u2019t grow easily in a lab, the phage is difficult to rear (Price, 2014; Yong, 2014). Not enough is known in order to determine the life cycle of the virus, like whether the bacteriophage is a lytic phage such as Bacteriophage T7 or a temperate phage such as Bacteriophage \u03bb. In an attempt to isolate the bacteriophage, a plaque assay was performed. However, the results were unfavorable and Dutilh </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. determined the plaques that did form are from different bacteriophages and not the crAssphage. The research team determined that more information about the phage itself is needed in order to find better ways to isolate the virus. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Takeaway</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Ever since metagenomics was introduced, there has been a great effort towards discovering viruses that are known to exist, but have not been identified -also referred to as the \u201cknown unknown.\u201d After a sample has been processed, data is given back as mass amounts of genetic sequences and most are identifiable after aligning or matching the sequences with an annotated reference database. These \u201cknown unknown\u201d viruses are shown as genetic sequences that are difficult to identify even after using standard methods (Dutilh, 2014). The team consisted of both biologists and computer scientists that worked together in order to find the virus. They believe that metagenomics is the next step into personalized phage-therapy in the clinical world. By utilizing methods in order to discover unknown viruses, one could isolate and identify a virus, and then find a personalized treatment for that one specific virus (Yong, 2014). This could be a new path in the world of medicine. </span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Dutilh, Bas E (2014).

Watching him struggle at a young age, I could only imagine how difficult it must have been dealing with strange and disapproving looks from peers and teachers. Through the gradual decline of symptoms over the years, he learned to cope with his tics and sought to educate others about the syndrome. Inspired by his story, I wrote this case report in hopes of share his journey with others.\u201d</span><br/>\n<span id=\"more-829\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by tics, which are involuntary, nonrhythmic, repetitive movements and vocalizations. In about half of the patients with Tourette syndrome, tic symptoms decline during adolescence and disappear by age 18. While it is possible for tics to persist into adulthood, in 40 to 45 percent of the cases tics\u2019 severity gradually declines. In this case report, the patient was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome at the age of eight and continues to display tics at the present age of 18.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Case Report</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The patient is an eighteen-year-old Asian male residing in suburban California. At age eight, he presented to a psychiatric outpatient department with a 2-month history of repetitive involuntary eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and throat clearing. The intensity and duration of these motor and vocal tics varied, with no single episode lasting more than a few seconds, but he was never completely symptom-free. The frequency of his tics ranged from many times a day to once every few days. These tics were more severe when the patient was fatigued or stressed and less severe when the patient was mentally focused. The patient could voluntarily suppress the tics for a few minutes at a time, but such effort induced great stress and restlessness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Prior to displaying symptoms of Tourette syndrome, the patient was reported by his family to possess a sunny disposition. He excelled in his academic endeavors and maintained friendly relationships with his peers. With the emergence of tics, the patient began to feel embarrassed at school as his symptoms drew the attention of his teachers and fellow students. His teachers attributed the symptoms to typical disruptive classroom behavior and relayed their observations to the patient\u2019s family. When the behavior persisted for more than a month, the teachers recommended the parents to seek professional assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The patient\u2019s family sought medical expertise two months after the onset of symptoms when the patient was eight. The patient </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">had a normal delivery with no antenatal or postnatal complications and experienced no developmental problems. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">He has no history of psychotic symptoms, hyperactivity, obsessiveness, compulsiveness, or substance abuse. There is no family history of mental disorders. The psychiatrist performed a continuous performance test (CPT) of attention, revealing borderline severity of Tourette syndrome. No triggering factors could be identified. Observed symptoms included excessive eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and throat clearing. A physical examination showed no other abnormalities. The neuropsychological examination revealed that the patient had intact thought processes and higher mental functioning. Comorbidities of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were excluded by clinical interview. Lead poisoning was eliminated as a potential cause of the observed symptoms through a laboratory blood test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The psychiatrist educated the patient and his family about Tourette syndrome and recommended that they speak with the patient\u2019s teachers about his condition so that individualized support and supervision could be provided. Since the patient\u2019s symptoms did not interfere significantly with his social and academic performance, the psychiatrist eliminated medication as a treatment option. With a newfound understanding of Tourette syndrome, the patient was able to better cope with his symptoms and his negative emotional responses to the disorder declined. His confidence was gradually restored with the support of his family, friends, and teachers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The patient\u2019s eye blinking persisted for two years but decreased in intensity and frequency until it completely disappeared at the age of ten. However, he continues to display shoulder shrugging and throat clearing at the current age of 18, though their severity has been steadily decreasing. Presently, the patient exhibits these symptoms at a frequency of a few tic episodes per month, each lasting one to three seconds.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Discussion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tourette syndrome is one of the three tic disorders recognized by the </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> under neurodevelopmental disorders (APA 2013). The exact cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown, though studies suggest that it involves complex interactions among social, environmental, and genetic factors. One hypothesis is that defect in the striatal-thalamic-cortical spinal system causes disinhibition of the motor and limbic system, leading to Tourette syndrome. The disorder is often transmitted bilineally, but scientists haven\u2019t been able to identify specific genes responsible for producing the symptoms. The offspring of parents with Tourette syndrome faces a 22 percent risk in developing the disorder, while siblings of Tourette patients have a risk of around 8 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The diagnosis of Tourette syndrome does not involve any laboratory tests. Instead, a clinical evaluation is performed following the DSM guidelines. To avoid misdiagnosis, Tourette syndrome is characterized by three critical components. First is the presence of both motor and vocal tics for more than a year, though they do not need to occur simultaneously. Second, the tic onset must be before age 18 years. Third, tics must not be caused by substance intake or another medical condition. A family history of similar neurological symptoms supports the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. The diagnosis of Tourette syndrome can also be buttressed by the presence of comorbidities including ADHD and OCD. Tourette syndrome can be isolated from other hyperkinetic movement disorders such as chorea, dystonia, athetosis, myoclonus, and paroxysmal dyskinesia by its two unique qualities: the ability to suppress tics and the premonitory sensations that often precede tics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Education about Tourette syndrome to people who interact with the patient is key to managing the disorder. Only when symptoms of Tourette syndrome interfere with social, academic, or occupational performance is intervention warranted. Treatment methods are directed to eliminate the most serious symptoms, including those of comorbidities such as ADHD, OCD, and mood disorders. When tics are mild and nondisabling, education and counseling present an effective plan to treat Tourette syndrome. But when tics become troublesome, medications such as </span><a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+tetrabenazine-drug-information?source=see_link\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">tetrabenazine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, </span><a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+fluphenazine-drug-information?source=see_link\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">fluphenazine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, and or</span><a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+risperidone-pediatric-drug-information?source=see_link\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">risperidone</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> are prescribed to alleviate the symptoms. Fluphenazine is a dopamine receptor blocker whereas tetrabenazine is a </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">dopamine depleter that inhibits vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2). Both drugs work to reduce tics\u2019 frequency and intensity by approximately 60 to 80 percent (Jankovic 2015). It is advantageous to use the latter antidopaminergic drug because it provides the same benefits </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">without the harmful side effect of </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">tardive dyskinesias, a disorder leading to involuntary, repetitive body movements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to the pharmacologic approach, behavioral therapy is recommended as an alternative intervention strategy. More specifically, habit reversal training (HRT) is implemented to control tics. There are two components of HRT: tic-awareness training, which focuses on recognizing early signs of tic onset, and competing-response training, which develops a voluntary movement that opposes the tic. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There are several limitations that apply to this treatment method. First, in order for this behavioral management to be successful, the parents and the therapist must be well versed in the HRT techniques so they can be actively involved in the training process. Such endeavor requires a substantial commitment of time and effort on the part of the patient, the therapist, and the parents. Due to these rigorous demands, it is unlikely that all parties will be able to maintain the necessary compliance with the treatment plan for sustained benefit to be observed. Another concern addresses the possibility that the patient\u2019s attention and learning may be negatively impacted by the mental effort required to fully comply with HRT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">If tics are concentrated in specific muscles in the body, botulinum toxin injections into the affected regions offer a viable treatment option. To treat the comorbid condition of ADHD, alpha adrenergic agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine are used to suppress related behavioral symptoms, especially those associated with impulse control and rage attacks. Guanfacine is preferred over clonidine because it requires fewer daily doses and is less sedating. To treat symptoms of OCD, psychiatrists often prescribe </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information?source=see_link\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">fluoxetine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u00a0starting at 20 mg daily (Jankovic 2015).</span></p>\n<p><h4>Bibliography</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">[APA] American Psychiatric Association. c2013.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">\u201c<span style=\"font-weight:400\">I decided to write this article on the Wednesday after the presidential election. After the long whirlwind of campaigning, it seemed that many unanswered questions lingered. Health is one of the most immediate concerns for many people, and when accurate information about health exists, I think it should be provided so that individuals can make informed decisions. This article is an attempt to address a small fraction of the health concerns that were raised during the course of the presidential campaign.\u201d</span><span id=\"more-941\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">As speculation rises over the actions that President-elect Donald Trump will take once he enters the presidency, many Americans recall the statements made throughout his campaign that elicited a range of responses, including confusion. These statements include various comments regarding human health issues. A fact-based exploration into these claims and the realities of life science may clarify the differences between a remark and a scientifically-grounded, well-tested conclusion. Trump has engaged in many discussions related to science, but this paper will focus on three specific comments he has made regarding health topics, in order to reduce confusion for individuals who seek accurate information regarding health risks.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Cancer and Lightbulbs</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Among Trump\u2019s statements regarding human health, one touches on cancer risk. In a tweet from October 17, 2012, he stated that \u201cnew \u2018environment friendly\u2019 lightbulbs can cause cancer.\u201d[1] Some research does exist on this topic pertaining to compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), which are described by the Environmental Protection Agency as using less energy and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d[2]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">One study conducted by researchers at Stony Brook University found that human skin tissue cells exposed to CFLs decreased in proliferation rate and demonstrated some damage from UV radiation [3]. The researchers placed human skin cell cultures 2.5 centimeters away from the center of a CFL bulb in a cooled temperature. Samples were collected at different time points and analyzed for cell proliferation, migration, and several other characteristics. Results showed that under these circumstances, the cells exposed to CFL for two hours showed significantly reduced levels of mitochondrial activity, with a 25% reduction for keratinocytes and a 40% reduction for dermal fibroblasts. Additionally, some cells exposed to the bulb showed decreases in proliferation by 20%, 17% and 45%, relative to proliferation of the unilluminated control group [3]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are increased by the presence of UV light and are known to contribute to DNA damage and eventual cell death, particularly when combined with </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">endogenous photosensitizers in human skin</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. ROS amounts increased in human cell samples that were exposed to CFL, indicating a higher risk of cell death. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The study concluded that UV radiation emanating from CFL bulbs is potentially harmful to human skin. Of the damages discussed in the study, including reductions in mitochondrial activity, decreases in proliferation, and increases in cell death risk, the effects can contribute to </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">premature aging and impaired wound healing. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Although CFL bulbs cause cell damage according to the study, the damages do not include cancer. Trump\u2019s indication that CFL bulbs can cause cancer is not directly supported by this study, which has been cited by at least 22 peer-reviewed reports and books.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Ebola Transmission</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Trump has further expressed his concerns related to disease in terms of viral transmission. The Ebola viral disease entered an outbreak in 2014. On August 2, 2014, he tweeted \u201cThe U.S. must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our \u2018borders.\u2019 Act fast!\u201d[4] Two months later he tweeted \u201cEbola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting.\u201d[5] </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website states that the virus can be transmitted from human to human through the bodily fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola, by infected fruit bats or primates, and possibly from the semen of a man who has recovered from Ebola [6]. These claims by CDC align with the conclusions of numerous studies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The disease\u2019s transmission is somewhat complex due to the dramatic variation in its transmissibility depending on the stage of the disease, according to a report by Michael Klompas, MD, MPH</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">and Deborah S. Yokoe, MD, MPH [7]. Based on evidence from Ebola cases that were diagnosed outside of West Africa, transmission risk is essentially nonexistent during the initial phase of infection until symptoms appear. Incidents of person-to-person contact for that same group of cases indicated that transmission risk also appears to be very low during the first few days after symptoms arise. Researchers have found that Ebola transmission risk increases as the disease progresses, partly because patients eventually release greater amounts of vomit and diarrhea, which are bodily fluids that can transmit the virus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Ebola transmission is therefore relatively variable, and knowledge of the topic is still expanding. The CDC has responded and adjusted its recommendations as more information has become available. In contrast to Trump\u2019s claim that the CDC was not admitting to the full nature of transmission, the CDC was in fact learning and incorporating new information that was gained through the observation of these cases. Furthermore, his call for an immediate end to flights connecting the United States to Ebola-infected nations seems to have exaggerated the nature of Ebola transmission. A total halt on these flights would both limit the international assistance available to Ebola-stricken countries and prevent American healthcare workers from returning from those countries to the U.S., where infected Americans could be isolated and treated. As research and the CDC have indicated, transmission occurs through bodily fluids and can only take place after the appearance of symptoms. Based on this information, moderate precautions were and are necessary;</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">panic and ungrounded speculation are not productive factors in addressing Ebola from a fact-based approach. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Vaccines and Autism</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In addition to his comments on disease, Trump has weighed in on the process by which disease is prevented. Vaccinations have come under discussion during Trump\u2019s time in the public eye. In a Republican debate on September 16, 2015, he claimed, \u201cI am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.\u201d He attributed this perspective to his belief that vaccinations are linked to autism, which he has publicly claimed since at least 2012 [8].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The CDC has plainly stated that there is no link between vaccines and autism. It cites a report from the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies that discusses the results of an investigation of this and other concerns about adverse effects of vaccines.[9] The investigation involved both epidemiologic evidence from studies of populations and mechanistic evidence from biological and clinical studies. The committee also evaluated each scientific article for its strengths and weaknesses to ensure that the conclusions and evidence they used were sufficiently reliable. For some vaccines, the committee found that potential side-effects included rash, infection, and rarely, other complications including seizure, disease, and anaphylaxis. The committee investigated the rubella (MMR) vaccine for a linkage to autism, and the evidence led to a rejection of any relationship between the two.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Numerous studies have agreed with the conclusion of those findings. One in particular examined the association between autism and vaccines that contain thimerosal, which is a very common organic compound used as a preservative in vaccines for children [10]. In 2003, researchers studied data on children born in Denmark from January 1, 1990 through December 31, 1996. They statistically analyzed incidences of autism and vaccinations for the </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">467,450 individuals and found no evidence of an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Over 100 subsequent articles have cited this report, and numerous related studies have reached similar conclusions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The overwhelming evidence points to a lack of a causation or association between vaccines and autism. Trump\u2019s indication that he believes smaller doses should be given over a longer time period in order to avoid autism does not align with the findings of scientific research into the effects of vaccinations.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">A wealth of research exists regarding these and other health challenges that permeate America and the world. In order for individuals to accurately understand factors that may affect their health, it is important to consider the research that has been conducted into such impactful topics as cancer, viral disease, and autism. Knowledge of these topics continuously expands as new investigations take place, and individuals can gain a more complete understanding of their risks by considering the abundant studies that have addressed these issues. Likewise, as politicians seek to address health topics, it is important that they incorporate a consideration of various scientific studies into their dialogue and decisions to avoid public misunderstandings or panic. Therefore, if President-elect Trump is to make informed decisions that promote accurate understandings amongst Americans, he must utilize such findings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Sources</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Donald Trump (realDonaldTrump). \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Remember, new \u201cenvironment friendly\u201d lightbulbs can cause cancer.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cI chose to write about this topic as a response to one of the many uncertainties that exists under our newly elected president, Donald Trump. More specifically, this article is meant to encompass the nationwide effort by scientists, professors, researchers and archivists to safeguard, backup and protect work conducted in the realm of climate science. This topic, I believe, should be integrally important to most residents of this planet; due to the fact that we have no choice but to live the entirety of our lives here on earth. Therefore, my interview of the archivists at UC Davis seeks to uncover the motives and connotations that the DataRescue Davis event assumes.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In a time where the availability of information seems to be infinite, it can often be forgotten that as easy as it is to publish scientific data on the internet, it is just as easy if not easier to delete it. So, the</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">scientific community felt obligated to respond to this vulnerability. As a result, this gave birth to the DataRefuge project.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The DataRefuge project began at the University of Pennsylvania with the primary goal being to spearhead the \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u2026</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> identifying, assessing, prioritizing, securing, and distributing reliable copies of federal climate and environmental data so that it remains available to researchers.\u201d Due to the immense amount of climate and environmental research that happens at UC Davis, researchers felt the need to get involved. </span></p>\n<p>An ample amount of support was shown towards this idea, and so a formal event was planned. Publicized on Facebook by the UC Davis Library, the DataRescue Davis event welcomed all who desired to help in the process of preserving scientific research.</p>\n<p>The DataRescue Davis event was held on Feb. 2, aiming to backup environmental and climate science data sets in partnership with the DataRefuge project\u2019s archival system. Although archiving data of this sort had largely begun in 2008 during the Obama Administration, the Trump administration has incited a newfound urgency. This comes in turn with Trump\u2019s recent order for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to purge their website of all climate change information.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">By speaking with Kevin Miller, University Archivist, and Vessela Ensberg, Associate Director of the Data Management Program, the specificities of the DataRescue Davis event were made clear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cThe event here itself was on the third floor of the library in the data science initiative space,\u201d Miller said. Furthermore, he emphasized the fact that they were at full capacity for the event with a mix of both undergraduate and graduate participants. Most pleasantly surprising, expressed the pair, was that they ended up hosting a majority of technically sound website crawlers. This allowed them to give proper attention to novice participants, while also being able to keep productivity up. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Since this project is by nature political and set within an academic atmosphere, the archivists allowed its participants to remain anonymous as long as they had a desire to contribute. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily know a lot about the people who showed up, because we wanted to keep open the option of anonymity,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe wanted to keep it a safe space, but we had a sense that the majority of them had a UC Davis connection.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Both Ensberg and Miller reiterated that the archiving of data will always be important \u2014 \u201cthe more copies, the better\u201d is their agreed upon philosophy.

Although the presence of issues regarding bees in the United States was rather clear to me, their magnanimity remained largely obscure. Recently, I came across an article in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Economist</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> on the invention of an artificial pollinator. I began to better understand the far-reaching extent of the global pollination crisis caused by suffering bee populations and felt compelled to research the topic further. This article seeks to briefly detail current issues regarding the decline of domestic and wild bees, as well as the approaches being undertaken in response.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">On February 10, 2017, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) listed the rusty patched bumble bee </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">(Bombus affinis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">) as endangered \u2014 the primary reasons being habitat loss, disease, climate change, and pesticides associated with farming. The habitat of this now endangered species once ranged across 28 states within the United States, the District of Columbia, and 2 Canadian provinces. Since 2000, however, the bumble bee has been found in only 13 states and 1 Canadian province (1). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The implications of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bombus affinis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u2019s endangered status are widespread, considering the extensive impact of the species across ecosystems. Bumble bees are important pollinators that contribute to the production of many native flowering and seed crops, thereby providing sustenance for many wildlife populations. They also play a significant role in pollinating agricultural crops managed by humans, such as blueberries, apples, strawberries, almonds, and tomatoes. In fact, USFWS estimates that the economic value of pollination services provided by wild bees is approximately $3 billion per year in the United States (1). The newly endangered status of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bombus affinis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> thus raises a humanitarian concern, in addition to concerns regarding the welfare of plant and animal populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The current context of domestic bee populations adds considerable weight to these concerns. In November of 2006, drastic declines in honey bee (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Apis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">) populations were linked by researchers to a phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder, the cause of which is theorized to involve pathogens and viruses, poor nutrition due to loss of habitat, exposure to pesticides, lack of genetic diversity, and bee management practices. Declines in domestic bee populations remain ongoing and pose a contemporary threat to both U.S. and global agricultural and economic sustainability (2,5,7).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In response to this pollination crisis, many researchers, beekeepers, and organizations such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have directed their efforts toward sustaining both domestic and wild bee populations, and preventing their further decline (2,5). A different approach has been undertaken by a team of scientists and engineers led by Dr. Eijiro Miyako of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan. On February 9, 2017, Dr. Miyako published his experimental findings in \u201cMaterially Engineered Artificial Pollinators\u201d\u2014 the main result of his research being the creation of an artificially engineered pollinator in drone form. The pollinator is equipped with synthesized iconic liquid gel-coated horsehair fibers that allow it to successfully absorb and dispense pollen, as shown in Miyako\u2019s experiment with Japanese lilies (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Lilium japonicum</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">) (3,4,8).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Despite its success in the laboratory, Dr. Miyako\u2019s human-operated robotic pollinator cannot yet provide a feasible solution to our pollination crisis due to economic and practicality constraints (3,4). However, developments in artificial intelligence and GPS may enable artificial pollinators to become more widely implemented in the near future (4). It is worth noting that in addition to their intended contributions, research such as Dr. Miyako\u2019s and efforts in preventing the decline of bees have also progressively led to our heightened awareness of bees and their remarkably skilled contributions as pollinators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> Click </span><a href=\"https://savebees.org\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> to learn more about bee pollinator decline and how you can help declining bee populations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Sources:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cFact Sheet- Rusty Patched Bumble Bee (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bombus affinis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">).\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Endangered Species</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. 10 Jan. 2017.

        "title": "The Consequences of Tropical Deforestation",
        "author": "By: Wincy Yu, Biological Sciences, \u201817",
        "date": "04/28/2017",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In light of climate change and environmental talks among world leaders, as well as rising media attention for endangered species around the world, I realized that people were concerned about the consequences, but may not have paid attention to the underlying reasons. Inspired by an ecology class I took last year, I wrote this piece to discuss one of the reasons for climate change and ecosystem loss, which is deforestation.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Review</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tropical forests play many roles in the world of ecology. They are important sources of primary productivity on land, and they foster biodiversity as a habitat by providing shelter and food to many animals. They also play a key role in the carbon cycle, as they pull out large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to fuel plant growth [3]. In fact, tropical forests store over 340 billion tons of carbon in total, which is 40 times the total current worldwide fossil fuel emissions per year [2]. Therefore, it would be disastrous if all of that carbon were released through deforestation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The release of carbon leads to climate change. As climate change is happening more quickly, there are more droughts and extreme weather conditions around the world. Deforestation also destroys habitats and reduces biodiversity in the area, which ripples through the different community interactions and affects ecological food web relationships [1]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the main reasons for deforestation is the conversion of forestland for agricultural purposes. Large areas of land are cleared for palm oil plantations, pulp and paper mill operations, and other agricultural uses. More than half a million square miles of new farmland, 80% of which comes from tropical deforestation, was created in the developing world from 1980 to 2000 [2]. In fact, it is happening more quickly because there are powerful industrial technologies used to clear land faster. Small-scale clearings may seem to have a smaller impact in the short run than large clearings because it allows time for the recovery of forests, but when combined, will actual have the same or even greater effects. As global human population is growing, the amount of resources, such as food and gasoline fuel, required to support the growing population is also increasing. This prompts even more deforestation, even though there are severe ecological and economical consequences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are ecological consequences when forest fires are used as a method to clear land for agricultural purposes. Animals, as well as nearby villagers, can develop respiratory infections due to haze from the fire [5]. Burning debris can also cause economical and environmental damage. Endangered species, such as orangutans and elephants, are forced to move away from damaged forests and toward areas settled by humans. This leads to conflicts between humans and animals, which further endangers those species as farmers and villagers hunt and capture them. The disappearance of forests as a habitat disrupts the food web and leads to losses in agricultural production. For example, bees are important in pollinating apples, melons, onions, potatoes, tomatoes, and agricultural crops, but the burning of forests drives them away and ultimately decreases pollination and crop growth [5]. As global warming is causing more droughts and extreme weather such as El Ni\u00f1o, those droughts also cause natural forest fires that destroy seedlings and weaken the recovery of forests. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A potential solution to deforestation is afforestation, which is the effort to plant trees and create forests artificially [4]. This is helpful to preserve current natural forests, because these artificial forests can be used for commercial lumbering instead. It takes a shorter amount of time to create these forests, than for natural forests to recover its habitat and biodiversity fully. Even though it does take time for these artificial forests to grow as well, current technologies with improved fertilizers and agricultural techniques makes afforestation more effective. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Sources</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[1] Kim, Sexton, Townshend. 2015.

I never felt such confidence writing in academic English before taking Professor Matthew Oliver\u2019s UWP 104E class. This class is about writing in science, and the literature review is the basis of many scientific research projects. To develop future experiments, literature reviews help researchers maintain an up-to-date understanding of the field, identify strengths and limitations in current experimental designs, and get inspirations for their own research. I am interested in ecology and the relationship between humans and environment, so I decided to write about constructed wetlands. Since I am a plant-lover, a focus in my literature review research is plant selections and impacts on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> removal efficiency. UWP 104E is a great class that combines my interest with professional writing and helps me overcome language barriers in academic English.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1119\"></span><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p>Human population growth, economic development, and freshwater contamination contribute to pressures on available water systems. Domestic and municipal wastewater contain various pathogens that harm human health (Avelar, de Matos, de Matos, &amp; Borges, 2014). Conventional sewage process systems use chloride widely to eliminate pathogens. Using chloride simply and cost-effectively decreases pathogens, but by-products in the treated water contain carcinogens and toxic substances (Alexandros &amp; Akratos, 2016). People also use UV radiation for safer \u00a0pathogen elimination, but this method requires high facilities investment and long-term maintenance (Alexandros &amp; Akratos, 2016). Constructed Wetlands (CWs) technology began booming 10-15 years ago, but the primary focus now is on the removal of organic matters, solid waste, heavy metal, nitrogen, and phosphorous (Alexandros &amp; Akratos, 2016). However, recent studies pay more attention to the removal of pathogens by CWs.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CWs have channels that are filled with porous substrates such as coarse sand, crushed stone, or gravel. These bottom and side channels have low permeability and support plant growth (Avelar et al., 2014). Basically, CWs have three categories: 1) free water surface flow, 2) Horizontal Flow (HF), and 3) Vertical Flow (VF). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Among these three methods, HF has been studied the most worldwide because it produces less malodor and attracts fewer rats and mosquitoes</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Avelar et al., 2014).Although, Alexandros and Akratos suggest that VF bed with 65cm depth achieved a high pathogen removal rate (2016). Therefore, it is necessary to review both methods\u2019 removal efficiencies.</span></p>\n<p>Pathogen removal efficiency relates to different substrate textures, wastewater flow directions in CWs, plants species used in CWs, and mechanisms applied. However, all the experiments are constructed on a small-scale parameter of experimental basis and fail to consider pathogens introduced from the outside environment. For example, in real life application, a CW may attract migratory birds and herbivores around the area. Animal feces can pollute the remediated water again and lower pathogen removal efficiency. In tropical regions, cities with high population are more worthy of study than remote areas. The reason is that there are bigger populations in cities than in remote areas. If waterborne diseases outbreak in population-dense cities, it can be more harmful. CWs in cities should occupy less space because land is a scarce resource in a population-dense area. Overpopulation, high temperature and high humidity all lead to pathogenic outbreak in municipal water systems. Moreover, CW pathogen removal is a developing area, and each factor has some limitations that decrease the removal efficiency.</p>\n<p><h4>Two fixed factors in this review Temperature range and pathogen indicators</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Temperature enhances pathogen removal efficiency because pathogens reach maximum activity rate at 37</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2103 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Alexandros &amp; Akratos, 2016). Pathogens\u2019 metabolism rates are different at the freezing point, tropical temperature, and boiling point.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The tropical zone, located near the equator, is characterized by hot climate and high precipitation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Therefore, stable temperature range in a tropical area limits the variables in the research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It will be time-consuming to test all groups of pathogens in the research, so researchers test the most notorious five groups of waterborne diseases, which are enteric bacteria, protozoa, helminths, fungi, and viruses. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E.coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, TC (total coliforms), and FC (fecal coliforms) are common bacterium indicators (Alexandros &amp; Akratos, 2016). In the following review, \u201cpathogens\u201d refers to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E.coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, TC, and FC. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Substrate Difference</h4></p>\n<ul>\n<li><h4>Vf</h4></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In VF CWs, finer texture substrate, such as sand, has a higher pathogen removal rate than coarser substrate, gravel (Boh\u00f3rquez, Paredes, &amp; Arias, 2016). According to figure 1, raw wastewater is pre-treated in a sedimentation tank, attached by pump 1 and 2. There are eight smaller experimental units with different treatments, respectively. Letter \u201cS\u201d stands for sand and letter \u201cG\u201d stands for gravel. Units 2,3,6, and 7 have finer sand and the other four units have coarser gravel. Pathogen removal results show a significant difference between sand and gravel. The removal of TC and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. Coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in the gravel beds is very low: 0.00\u20130.08 log units, while 1.2\u20132.7 and 1.5\u20133.5 log units of TC and E. Coli are removed from the sand beds (Boh\u00f3rquez et al., 2016). Removal rates of suspension solids and pathogens (TC and E. Coli) are very low or null in gravel beds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, pre-treated raw wastewater in the sedimentation tank is a limitation of this experiment. Particle sizes influence the sedimentation speed, which means the bottom layer of the sedimentation tank acts as a pathogen sink (Alexandros &amp; Akratos, 2016). In this experiment, it is more plausible to say that the unsettled pathogens, which have smaller particle sizes, are removed more efficiently by sand than gravel. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><h4>Hf Combination</h4></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contrary to substrates in VF CWs, a combination of HF CW with slow sand filtration (SSF) cascade becomes an optimal pathogen removal approach (Seeger, Braeckevelt, Reiche, Mu\u0308ller, &amp; Ka\u0308stner, 2016). Because HF CWs require the least technology to construct, wastewater sometimes cannot meet the European Irrigation Water Standards through this process (Seeger et al., 2016). Using a weekly rotational cascade filter with a static cascade filter as a secondary treatment increases the removal efficiency (Seeger et al., 2016). Although, the investment in CWs and a series of SSF for secondary treatments should not be overlooked. Europeans tend to use HF for less odor, but SSF might not work in a tropical region, where water has high salinity. The HF combination system in Germany includes heating fans to prevent freezing during winter (Seeger et al., 2016). Freezing is not a problem in tropical regions, but water salinity can be. EC, measuring ions and electrical conductivity, determines water salinity. As water moves through fine texture sand layers, salt accumulates and the scale builds up, gradually. Scale deposit comes from the dissolved calcium and magnesium salts in the municipal water. Accumulation of scale can clog the whole SSF system, because the finer the sand, the slower the percolation rate. Changing the filtration layers frequently can help. More research in scale-breaking will be interesting.</p>\n<p><h4>Plant species influence</h4></p>\n<ul>\n<li><h4>Halophytes</h4></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vegetation contributes to HF and VF CWs in the following aspects. According to Fountoulakis et al., root systems increase filtration and sedimentation, accumulate oxygen and microbial activity in the root zone, and increase plant uptake of organic matter and heavy metals (2017). Halophytes, a group of plants, only grow under high salinity conditions. Research focused on halophytes in CWs started growing five years ago, but research focused on salt remediation began more recently (Fountoulakis, Sabathianakis, Kritsotakis, Kabourakis, &amp; Manios, 2017). In this study, researchers compare the pathogen removal ability between halophytes and reeds. Two identical VF CW tanks are filled with the same materials. One tank has three species of halophytes, and the other tank has reeds. Then, wastewater flows into both tanks and is distributed by valves onto the substrate surface (Fountoulakis et al., 2017).</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After nine months, TC and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E.coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> have a decreasing trend in the outlet planted with halophytes. In the presence of halophytes, TC decreases from 1.2 log units to 0.7 log units (Fountoulakis et al., 2017). On average, TC concentration in the inlet is 6.2 log units, while in the outlet of the VF CW planted with halophytes is 5.0 log units. The mean value of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. coli\u2019s</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> concentration in the outlet is also statistically important (p &lt; 0.05) (Fountoulakis et al., 2017). An explanation of this decreasing trend (Fig 6) is that halophytes\u2019 exudate contains methanol or hexane, and both substances act as antibacterial agents against </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. Coli </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Fountoulakis et al., 2017)</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></i></p>\n<p>This experiment took place in Greece, known for its Mediterranean climate. Halophytes that survive in Greece might not be able to deal with the high temperature and moisture in the tropical area. However, salinity is the most essential requirement for halophytes\u2019 survival (Fountoulakis et al., 2017). Tropical areas tend to be near coastal regions, and the municipal water supply there has high salinity. \u00a0Therefore, this salt tolerant plant may favor tropical areas. Also, in constructed wetland research, Halophytes are commonly used to treat salt accumulation more than to treat pathogens (Fountoulakis et al., 2017). Moreover, tidal surge and tidal backup, which bring brackish water into coastal cities, increase Halophytes\u2019 adaptability. Halophytes, growing in a densely populated city, help remove coliforms in the wastewater, which is beneficial to the public health.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><h4>Native Tropical Species</h4></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though new species can potentially become invasive, they are necessary because local species are ineffective towards pathogen removal. A study shows that the presence or absence of a tropical plant </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Heliconia psittacorum)</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> does not influence pathogen removal efficiency (Boh\u00f3rquez et al., 2016). Boh\u00f3rquez (2016) discovers that non-native species such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Phragmites, Typha, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Cyperus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are widely used in tropical CWs worldwide. He tests a tropical plant specie </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heliconia psittacorum,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> but the presence of this plant does not affect the removal of TC and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E.coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Boh\u00f3rquez et al., 2016). More tropical species are worth testing. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Removal Mechanisms</h4></p>\n<ul>\n<li><h4>Plant Coverage &amp; Root System</h4></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Plant species may have different abilities of removing pathogen indicators, but research shows that CWs covered with plants get benefits from several pathogen removal mechanisms. At a same water flow rate, TC decreases more in a planted wetland than an unplanted wetland (Weerakoon et al., 2016). Similar results come from research in southeastern Brazil, which has a tropical climate. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. coli </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">removal efficiency reaches 2.8 log units in planted CWs compared to 2.3 log units in unplanted CWs (Avelar et al., 2014).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A possible mechanism is that plant roots grow in water, and pathogens attached to the biotic roots have better removal rates (Avelar et al., 2014). Plant coverage is an advantage in tropical areas. Stable temperature range allows long growing seasons for plants. Adequate precipitation and sunlight foster fast-growing plants. Fibrous plant roots intertwine in the water and construct a huge pathogen filtration system. Many plants are proven to have this biofilm function along their root structures (VanKempen-Fryling &amp; Camper, 2017). If pathogens prefer attaching to biotic plant roots, it is easier to capture and analyze them compared with free-flowing pathogens in the waterway. A research study shows that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. Coli strain O157:H7</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has a significantly higher affinity to biotic plant roots than the abiotic nylon control group (VanKempen-Fryling &amp; Camper, 2017). </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><h4>Aeration</h4></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another mechanism of effective pathogen removal is the aeration and oxygen level around plant roots. Higher levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) around plant roots facilitate microorganism, such as E. coli, removal(Avelar et al., 2014). Fibrous roots act as a supportive system which enables a good aeration condition. TC removal efficiency reaches 1.37 log units and is higher in planted CWs than unplanted control CWs (Sharma &amp; Brighu, 2016). In this experiment, researchers study plant species </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Phragmitis australis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Canna indica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In the VF CW design, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">C. indica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has a higher pathogen removal efficiency than </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">P. australis,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> which are 1.87 log unit and 1.01 log unit, respectively (Sharma &amp; Brighu, 2016). An explanation is that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">P. australis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">removes pathogens more efficiently in HF CWs than VF CWs (Sharma &amp; Brighu, 2016). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">C.</span><i>indica</i> has a higher DO level than <i>P. australis </i>and the unplanted control group (Sharma &amp; Brighu, 2016). Fibrous root systems increase the aeration capacity of <i>C. indica, </i>and pathogens do not favor the aerobic environment (Sharma &amp; Brighu, 2016). Therefore, improved aeration in the root zone provides additional removal efficiency; oxidizing pathogens on the root surface decreases the total pathogen load (Sharma &amp; Brighu, 2016). VF CWs should have an aerobic environment in the water and an anaerobic environment at the bottom. In water, pathogens have a predilection to biotic medium, which is the fibrous root system. Roots respire all the time and provide an aerobic environment. More DO around the root zone reduces the pathogenic activity, and increases the removal efficiency. This research takes place in Rajasthan, India, where the climate is semi-arid. However, <i>C. indica </i>can survive in tropical areas without any problems. <i>C. indica</i> is a frost-sensitive plant, which means it cannot survive in cold areas. It has been found in South America, Mexico, southeastern United States, Africa, and Asia. This research potentially refutes the idea that tropical plants cannot remove pathogens (Boh\u00f3rquez et al., 2016), because <i>C. indica </i>grows worldwide in tropical areas.</p>\n<p><h4></h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reference</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alexandros, S.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI became interested in vector-borne diseases in Spring of 2016, when I conducted an independent study on the ethical advancement of genetically modifying technology. I discussed the potential application of CRISPR to mosquitoes, primarily </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aedes aegypti</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, in the effort to combat dengue. Throughout my extensive research, the danger posed by mosquitoes was commonly emphasized by diverse sources. It was thus surprising to read that Microsoft\u2019s Project Premonition is based on the assertion that mosquitoes can be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">useful </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to us in our quest to control vector-borne diseases. My intrigue led me to research the project further to better understand its method, application, and potential.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vector-borne epidemics have become increasingly common across the globe, causing over 1 million deaths and affecting over 1 billion people annually [8]. As such, efforts to mitigate their spread have gained momentum. Due to the fact that numerous emerging vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and zika are transmitted primarily by mosquitoes, many disease-control strategies have focused on minimizing mosquito populations [8]. Among the diverse strategies that have been tested and employed on mosquitoes are genetically modifying them with gene-editing techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) or release of insects with dominant lethality (RIDL), altering their habitats and resources by introducing competitor or predatory species, and using insecticides. Each of these methods have been met with varying degrees of success and concern for the safety of their use [3,5,6]. One particular team has undertaken a different approach \u2013 rather than attempting to combat mosquito populations, Microsoft\u2019s Project Premonition seeks to learn from the valuable information they can provide us. It does so with the vision that future vector-borne outbreaks may not only be controlled, but avoided altogether [7]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is unusual to suggest that mosquitoes, being the primary vectors of harmful infectious diseases, may be used to prevent such diseases. Since its inception in 2015, Project Premonition, led by Microsoft researcher Ethan Jackson, has worked to create a system that uses data collected from mosquitoes to detect pathogens before they cause widespread outbreaks. This has been difficult to do thus far, mainly because of the difficulty in collecting reliable data using current traditional techniques. Project Premonition aims to override this obstacle by effectively finding \u201cmosquito hotspots\u201d with drones rather than satellites, collecting mosquitoes with robotic traps that are equipped to lure and identify specimens, and detecting both known and unknown pathogens with a metagenomics approach that involves gene sequencing the collected mosquito DNA with a SNAP alignment tool, a recent development made collaboratively by Microsoft, UC Berkeley, and UCSF [1,2,4,7]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The project aims to acquire data on mosquito genetics and behavior across various species, as well as environmental data pertaining to natural factors such as time, wind, temperature, and light levels. The data will be analyzed collectively to visualize patterns in mosquitoes and the spread of vector-borne diseases, which will then be used to predict oncoming epidemics. In doing so, the project can enable disease-mitigation strategies to work more efficiently, simply by alerting them to certain diseases that are gaining prevalence. The project may also enable diseases to be prevented completely [4,7].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While Project Premonition is not a solution to the vector-borne epidemics currently affecting world populations, it offers itself as a potentially valuable method for disease prevention in the near future. The collaborative effort between Microsoft and various academic and research institutions, such as Johns Hopkins University, UCSF, UC Riverside, and UC Berkeley, highlights the project\u2019s multidimensional and innovative approach, which may help ensure its practicality in terms of cost, safety, and efficacy. Despite its atypical attitude toward disease-spreading mosquitoes, Project Premonition\u2019s ability to recognize the usefulness of mosquitoes as well as their imposing threat is precisely what makes its endeavor promising [4,7]. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Boyle, Alan. \u201cHow Microsoft\u2019s Project Premonition uses robotic traps to zero in on Zika mosquitoes.\u201d 16 February 2017.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI started to look into entomological research as a result of learning about insect diversity in ENT100. I came across a study regarding ants\u2019 fascinating advanced ability to cultivate fungi. I thought it was incredible that we have agriculture in common with those tiny insects, and became interested in how ants are similar to and perhaps more advanced than humans in some ways.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Human agriculture emerged from early domestication of plants and animals, and for centuries humans have managed and harvested those domesticates. Subsequent developments including crop rotation, controlled nitrogen fixation, and the creation of advanced farming tools have led to a highly technological and controlled cultivation system in many parts of the world. Yet human adaptability and ingenuity are not the only traits that can contribute to this kind of development; a tiny insect species was able to conduct complex agriculture long before our own arose.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ants\u2019 well-known practice of cultivating fungi in an agricultural manner is becoming a focal point of further research about how this complex practice derived from processes deeply-rooted in evolutionary history. These new insights indicate that ants\u2019 agricultural similarities with humans evolved by dispersal into areas where fungi would need ants\u2019 help in order to survive. As Ted Schultz, a leading entomologist explained, the ants provide vital resources for their cultivars, and \u201cIf things are getting a little too dry, the ants go out and get water and they add it\u2026If they\u2019re too wet, they do the opposite.\u201d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1 </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ants that farm fungus have been found in the Americas in tropical forests, deserts, and grasslands. The 250 different species of these ants are part of the subtribe Attina of the tribe Attini within the subfamily Myrmicinae of the family Formicidae, which is the family of all ant species. An Attina queen\u2019s daughter begins a new colony with its own fungal garden by taking part of the original fungi and moving away to a different location. Ant farming can be designated as either \u201clower\u201d or \u201chigher\u201d depending on complexity of the system. The fungi of lower agriculture are able to escape out of the cultivation area and back into a wild state because they are facultative symbionts, meaning they do not necessarily need the relationship in order to survive. Higher farming prevents that escape because their fungi are obligate symbionts to the ants, so they require the relationship for survival.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Therefore, the system of higher agriculture involves a greater degree of interdependency and specificity in the symbionts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Biologists and entomologists associated with the Smithsonian Institute conducted a related study that was recently published. The researchers sought to examine the domestication of fungi cultivated by higher attine ants, and whether those higher ants domesticated fungi in South America or elsewhere.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They acknowledged that biologists widely believe that ant agriculture began 55 \u2013 65 million years ago in South American tropical rainforests, and that a subsequent fungal domestication event, which led to the more complex higher agriculture, also took place in that region. However, this study was the first phylogenetic investigation into whether domestication did in fact occur in those same environmental conditions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The team of researchers used phylogenomic data from ultra-conserved element (UCE) loci to reconstruct the ants\u2019 evolutionary history. The study\u2019s methods included using various bioinformatics software to produce an alignment set that included 950 loci and 652,774 bp of sequence data, out of the ants\u2019 genome size that can range from about 300 Mb to 630 Mb depending on the exact species.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The researchers then performed phylogenetic analyses with three different approaches: maximum likelihood (ML), Bayesian inference (BI), and species tree (ST). The ML approach involved calculating the relative likelihoods of four different potential phylogenetic trees. In BI, they analyzed both parsimony starting trees and random starting trees. The ST approach allowed them to generate gene trees that excluded uninformative loci. The information garnered from these approaches allowed them to generate several different chronograms for the evolution of fungus-farming ants, and subsequent biogeographic models and trait reconstruction analyses. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This process led the researchers to results that support the well-established hypothesis that ants\u2019 fungal farming began in South America\u2019s rainforests. However, they also concluded that the transition from lower ant agriculture to higher ant agriculture, through fungal domestication, likely occurred in a dry or seasonally dry habitat (such as a savannah) about 30 million years ago. They reason that domestication requires some level of genetic isolation, so ants\u2019 dispersal into drier regions may have allowed strains of their fungal symbionts to isolate from other fungal bodies that remained in wet areas. This isolation allowed coevolution to take place between the farmer ants and their symbionts, as the newly isolated fungi relied on their ant farmers to cultivate them in the dry environment. Thus ants\u2019 dispersal to dry areas allowed certain fungi to grow in dry regions that they otherwise could not. The researchers indicated that the increased dominance of leaf-cutter ants, which cultivate domesticated fungi, is one result of this dispersal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This study not only provides more information about ant\u2019s agricultural evolution, but also illustrates the importance of testing even well-established and widely accepted hypotheses. The findings regarding domestication reveal the evolutionary mechanism of a significant mutualism that developed earlier than humans\u2019 domestication of crops. Attine ants were performing agriculture long before humans, so perhaps further research into their evolution could provide expanded insight into early ecological processes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sources</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAnt agricultural revolution began 30 million years ago in dry, desert-like climate.\u201d Phys.org. 11 April 2017.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wallace, Tim. \u201cAnts thrived in a cooling climate by taming fungus.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cosmos Magazine. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">12 April 2017.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Branstetter, Michael G., et al. \u201cDry habitats were crucibles of domestication in the evolution of agriculture in ants.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proceedings of the Royal Society B. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">12 April 2017.

She is a professor of Soil Science and Microbial Ecology at UC Davis, and her research emphasizes microorganisms\u2019 roles in providing ecosystems services. Dr. Scow was featured in an article on a UC Davis website about carbon sequestration as a tactic to address climate change, and from there I discovered Russell Ranch, where she serves as Director (1). I immediately became interested in the variety of experiments conducted on the experimental farm, and began to learn more about Dr. Scow\u2019s work. Her work is extensive; in addition to directing Russell Ranch, she actively works with Ugandan smallholder farms on irrigation. I sat down with Dr. Scow to discuss her passion for soil, what her research has taught her, how her relationship with soil has evolved, and what other people can learn from the powerful ecosystem that lives underground. </span><span id=\"more-1578\"></span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SL:</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What sparked your interest in soils?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KS: When I was fourteen my family drove across Europe through a number of countries. For some reason, I collected a soil sample from each country. I have no idea why I did that, except [to have it] as a memory of a place, a different kind of memory than sugar packets and postcards\u2026And I didn\u2019t think a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bout soil ag</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ain for years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then in college I studied</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> biology. I was really interested in animal behavior\u2026I finished my Bachelor\u2019s Degree at Antioch College and then went to University of Chicago and studied Evolutionary Biology. I worked at Brookfield Zoo </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">near Chicago</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">did research on social behavior of baboons and big cats</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2026I ended up leaving graduate school and moving to Boston. I worked for an environmental consulting firm\u2026and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the remarkable thing I discovered there was soil. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I learned that soil was so important yet remarkably invisible to most, a combination of being so significant yet so overlooked. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think that really pulled me towards it. Soil is at the center of so much of what is happening globally\u2013the flow of energy, the cycling of elements, and it is the home of enormous biodiversity. We didn\u2019t even know how diverse soil was back then, [but it was] so important and so mysterious and there was so much more to learn. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And I always use the word \u201clove\u201d when I talk about soil. I fell in love and just totally lost my heart to soil. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SL: How has your interest in soil science evolved since then?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KS: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I began my career working on contamination by organic pollutants and their biodegradation by microorganisms in soil. I\u2019m really interested in the capacity of indigenous microbial communities to break down contaminants in the environment. From there I branched out to studying the roles of soil microorganisms in agricultural systems\u2026I became interested in soil processes and microbial communities on the farm, and their connections to human communities and the larger food system.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SL: Can you briefly explain the purpose of Russell Ranch and how you got involved as Director?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">K</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S: Russell Ranch Sustainable Agriculture Facility, part of the Agricultural Sustainability Institute, is one of [a few] long term research experiments on the planet, initially founded almost thirty years ago. I became Director about 10 years ago. The goal is to study the effects of different agricultural practices and management systems on the environmental and economic sustainability, and resilience, of agroecosystems. Russell Ranch is a hub for researchers and stakeholders to come together, collaborate and exchange ideas on a common experiment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The [other main purpose] is long term research. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most research projects last two or three years if you\u2019re lucky. If you are studying sustainability, change is often small and incremental, over long periods of time. You won\u2019t see much in just a couple of years. Longer time is needed to detect changes, good or bad, and relate them back to effects of different practices: fertilizer use, irrigation practices, soil management, or to phenomena you can\u2019t control like climate change.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SL: In your time as director, what have been some of your favorite findings?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KS: There\u2019s a number of interesting things. We have compared crop yields and soil quality of organic and conventional tomato-corn rotations in our Century Experiment after 20 years. The conventional system receives synthetic fertilizers and synthetic pesticides; the organic is fertilized by winter cover crops and composted poultry manure. Averaged over the years, the yields of conventional and organic tomatoes are approximately the same. But what is different and quite dramatic is that conventional yields vary a lot, year to year, sometimes higher and sometimes lower. In contrast, the yields of the organic system are far more stable and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">seem</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> more resilient to changes in weather, pests or whatever is underlying those variations. Soils are really different too! The organic soils have about 30% more carbon and microbial biomass, higher aggregate structure and water infiltration rates than the conventional soils. We are sequencing their microbiomes now and anticipate some major differences!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A food chemist, Alyson Mitchell, [is] interested in antioxidants in food [and] measured the flavonoid content of tomato fruit in organic and conventional management systems. In our archived tomato samples collected over more than a decade, she found significantly higher flavonoids in organic than conventional tomatoes appearing after 4-5 years of management. This kind of research on how agricultural practices affect the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">quality</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and not just </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">quantity</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of food is so important these days with our focus on nutrition. Russell Ranch is an excellent place to study these questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Research we\u2019ve done on deficit irrigation of tomatoes has revealed that we can reduce water inputs to tomatoes to as much as 40% of what we\u2019d predict based on the plant\u2019s evapotranspiration (ET). We start the reduction 6 weeks before harvest. Not only are the tomato yields the same as if you\u2019d given them 100% water, but the solids content of the fruit is much higher. The tomato processors like this because it reduces the amount of water they need to get rid of. It is definitely one of those win-win results.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SL: Generally, how has looking deep into the ground below shaped the way you view the rest of the world?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KS: I get a lot of inspiration from the soil\u2026it\u2019s anchored me, I suppose. I\u2019m really interested in this question: is soil alive, or is soil a habitat for living things? I think our relationship t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">o soil</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> would be different if we viewed it as a livi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ng thing. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of course some folks have had that concept forever; living soil is interwoven in the idea of Pachamama in the Andes. In the US, in a lot of modern agricultural practices, soil is treated more as an inert medium.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I sometimes say soil is everywhere but it\u2019s nowhere. Though we walk on it everyday, many don\u2019t think twice and know little about this tremendous life force that\u2019s going on beneath our feet. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With climate change and soil erosion, it is more pressing than ever for all of us to learn how to take better care of soils and strengthen our relationship with it. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen so much attention on soil from the public. I\u2019m very curious to see where this new attention goes in terms of widespread adoption of regenerative agricultural practices and policies that protect the soil.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SL: You were saying</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> it isn\u2019t very obvious what\u2019s ha</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ppening to the soil. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KS: Soil is a bit secre</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">tive and hard to read.

You just don\u2019t see much with your bare eyes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Soil is in trouble. We are losing it globally at alarming rates\u2013through erosion and pollution and urban development\u2013and it takes an enormous amount of time to rebuild soil. As a society we are far more aware of the impacts of degraded water and air than soil. Soil needs champions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fortunately, awareness around soil is growing\u2026for example, the concept that soil needs to be healthy to provide healthy food and in turn healthy humans [is becoming more publicized]. More farmers are adopting practices to regenerate soils. California and US agencies are developing policies to promote soil health. And I\u2019ve noticed a growing interest in the public and among students.

        "date": "06/22/2018",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Author\u2019s note: In my Global Environmental Interactions class, we learned a lot about nitrogen and phosphorous as essential elements, but also as sources of eutrophication which threatens life in the ocean by disrupting food chains and causing anoxia. I decided to write a paper about the potential for microalgae to be cultivated as a way to remove those nutrient inputs from the water before it reaches the ocean, changing their role from the source of eutrophication to a possible solution. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While nitrogen and phosphorus are an important supply of nutrients that feed the marine food chain, excessive inputs can cause eutrophication, a condition in which the water becomes too enriched with these nutrients. As more nitrogen and phosphorus enter the ecosystem from agricultural, industrial, and municipal runoff, the natural food chain can not keep up with the growth of phytoplankton and algae that result. These organisms consume the nutrients and their populations multiply, creating a layer of algae above the water that blocks light from the organisms below (Mee 2006, Diaz et al. 2008). Eventually, these organisms die and bacteria consume oxygen to break them down, in many cases causing oxygen exhaustion and resulting in dead zones (Mee 2006). Though overproduction of algae in the ocean due to eutrophication can harm the balance of ecosystems, in a controlled environment they can be a valuable tool if used as wastewater treatment and potentially used as raw material to make biofuel. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nitrogen and phosphorus support algae growth, making algae a viable resource for wastewater treatment seeking to reduce concentrations of these nutrients in runoff. A common treatment for wastewater chemically produces sludge as a byproduct, removing much of the nitrogen and phosphorus from the water so it does not cause eutrophication downstream, but the phosphorus precipitate that results is typically disposed of in landfills or used to create sludge fertilizer (Pittman et al. 2011). Microalgae perform a similar function without the use of chemical treatment, providing a practical option to remove heavy metals, nitrogen, and phosphorus from wastewater without producing a sludge byproduct (Cai et al. 2013). Due to the high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in agricultural runoff from fertilizers and manure, algae productivity in this kind of wastewater effectively removes the excess nutrients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If cultivated in High Rate Algal Ponds (HRAPs), microalgae can both treat wastewater and be a source of biofuel. The algae grown in wastewater treatment processes can be extracted and used as feedstock for fuel through anaerobic respiration for biogas, lipids to biofuel, or carbohydrate fermentation to bioethanol. This option is attractive for its reuse of resources: HRAP systems which exclusively cultivate feedstock for biofuel are more costly and resource intensive than land-based biofuel sources, however, if combined with wastewater treatment, nutrients and water that would otherwise be wasted can be put to use (Park et al. 2011). Pittman et al. refer to a species of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chlorella</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> grown in a municipal wastewater oxidation pond in India to demonstrate the effect that additional nutrient inputs have on biomass. Acting as a \u00a0photoheterotroph, the algae produced a biomass of 379 mg/L after 10 days, compared to 73.03 mg/L as a photoautotroph (Pittman et al. 2011). This suggests that in a HRAP system, algae could be a viable source of biomass production. Additionally, high CO2 content produces greater biomass. If anaerobic digestion produces biogas on site, the exhaust from that energy generation could be used as a CO2 input, making the system up to two times more productive with proper amounts of CO2 (Park et al. 2011). While a number of other factors contribute to algal biomass production including algal species, pH of the water, light saturation, lipid production, and nutrient availability, with proper design, experimentation, and implementation, these parameters can be addressed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When cultivated in partnership with wastewater treatment, algae can be a feedstock source for biogas, simultaneously providing sustainable energy and reducing the effects of eutrophication. Though more research is needed to determine the practicality of joint wastewater-biogas projects, many high-rate algal ponds are currently used on a small-scale for water treatment, particularly in small communities (Park et al. 2011). Potential lies within using the algae grown as a fuel source, which would reduce water and arable land used currently to grow soy and corn for bio-ethanol, and reduce the effects of eutrophication by consuming nitrogen and phosphorous before it reaches the ocean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Works Cited</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cai, T., Park, S.

        "date": "07/13/2018",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>Author\u2019s Note: I wrote this paper for my UWP 104E class. I have always been interested in sustainability, and this paper provided me with an excellent outlet for researching methods related to environmentally friendly packaging options. In recent years, I have become increasingly aware of the harshness of plastics and other synthetic polymers on the planet. This paper serves to educate others about ways to improve the overall sustainability of the plastic industry.</p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4>\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is an environmentally friendly plastic polymer that is made from entirely renewable sources. Its production, however, is costly and intensive. PLA is derived from lactic acid, which can be synthesized either industrially under conditions of extreme heat and pressure, or biologically by microorganisms. The biodegradation of PLA is continually being improved through the addition of modifiers such as chitosan. Research is also underway to identify more economical methods of PLA production and decomposition.</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4>\nThe mass-production of processed foods in the United States has caused a significant upsurge in the amount of plastic that is used for packaging. Plastics and polymers are commonly used for food storage because they are low-cost and sanitary. With the rapid growth of domestic landfills and the unfortunate expansion of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, it is vital that more biodegradable and sustainable polymers are used for packaging of all kinds. Polylactic acid (PLA) is a plastic derived from entirely \u201crenewable resources such as sugar, corn, potatoes,\u201d and other plants (Vasile et al. 2018), which has become desirable because it is durable, rigid, and easily processed. Its applications range from food packaging to biomedical usage (Spiridon et al. 2018). This review will discuss the methods of PLA production and biodegradation, as well as how the composite can be used to improve the sustainability of plastic production.</p>\n<p><h4>Catalytic Synthesis of PLA from Lactide</h4>\nProducing PLA directly from natural plant sources is often difficult and inefficient. Catalytic synthesis of PLA is a commercial process by which the cyclic dimer of lactic acid, lactide, undergoes a ring-opening process using a tin catalyst. The reaction that converts pure lactic acid to lactide is a dehydration reaction under equilibrium, meaning that the lactide produced must also be removed in order for its production to continue. There are multiple experimental methods that can accomplish this, including prepolymerization and continuous synthesis. Batch prepolymerization uses high pressures and temperatures to dehydrate \u201cthe lactic acid to a prepolymer\u201d of lactide. In continuous synthesis, a prepolymer is continually fed to a reactor under high temperatures with a tin catalyst, producing lactide.</p>\n<p>After production, the crude lactide will require purification. One method is distillation, but the process is intense and requires at least two distillation tubes at low pressures and temperatures ranging from 200-300\u00baC. Other methods include crystallization of lactide, which allows it to be removed from the lactic acid and its oligomers. More traditional methods like \u201cabsorption or membrane separation\u201d can also be employed (Groot et al. 2010).</p>\n<p><h4>Biosynthesis of Lactic Acid</h4>\nBecause industrially produced lactic acid is often contaminated, microorganisms are responsible for the majority of lactic acid production in biotechnology. Their products are often the most pure and, under the right conditions, the process is very efficient. These bacteria, yeast, and fungi perform glycolysis and alcoholic fermentation under anaerobic conditions, during which the enzyme lactic dehydrogenase converts pyruvate into lactate, which becomes lactic acid when in a water solution (Groot et al. 2010).</p>\n<p>The use of these microorganisms, however, can be costly. Thus, it has become increasingly popular to use \u201cresidual biomass from agriculture\u201d to produce the lactic acid that is used for sustainable PLA production (Tan et al. 2017). The direct condensation of lactic acid is the most commonly used lab method for the isolation of pure product. However, this process can often leave behind residual water molecules and yield lower molecular weight polymers. Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals in Japan, has recently patented a method in which high temperatures are used \u201cto drive the removal of water in the direct esterification process to obtain high-molecular weight PLA,\u201d which is more durable (Elsawy et al. 2017).</p>\n<p><h4>Degradation of PLA</h4>\nThe primary reason to use PLA over other polymers is to improve the ecological footprint of industrial plastic production. It has become imperative that scientific researchers study the reaction mechanisms and rates of PLA polymer biodegradation. The reaction that recycles PLA back to its simpler components occurs through \u201crandom hydrolytic scission of ester bonds\u201d coupled with the \u201cdiffusion of water in to the amorphous regions\u201d of the semicrystalline PLA. This step is then followed by hydrolytic attack and degradation of the crystalline amorphous regions of the molecules (Elsawy et al. 2017). The degradation of the polymer is influenced by a variety of factors. A recent PLA study concluded that along with the addition of chitosan (discussed below), a long period of soil burial and access to greater than average amounts of ground water is needed in order to significantly increase degradation rates (Mitelut et al., 2018).</p>\n<p>To achieve complete decomposition, PLA must be degraded into lactic acid and then further into carbon dioxide and water. The team of Elsawy et al. (2017) researched this process and found that the hydrolytic degradation rate was dependent on molecular weight, temperature, and pH. When studied at extreme pH levels, degradation was more rapid. Rapid degeneration of PLA into its substituents and regeneration into new PLA is key to this polymer\u2019s sustainability. Avoiding the use of raw materials in the production of PLA is both cost and energy efficient, making this substance more renewable and recyclable.</p>\n<p><h4>Modification Strategies</h4>\nMaterial scientists all over the world recognize that the natural degradation of PLA is too slow to be as sustainable as is necessary. It is also too brittle to be more trustworthy in packaging than traditional plastic polymers. Scientific development is currently underway to improve the overall performance of this material. One promising method is plasticizing, in which other chemicals are added to the mixture in order to improve elongation of polymers, impact resistance, and rigidity.</p>\n<p>Increasingly common is the method of improving PLA\u2019s structure by blending in \u201cvarious synthetic and biopolymers\u201d (Elsawy et al. 2017). Most often, a fiber called chitosan is used as a blending agent, which, although very difficult to effectively incorporate into the PLA mixture, has the ability to improve the biocompatibility and mechanical properties of the plastic. The addition of chitosan was observed to improve the hydrolytic degradation rate of PLA due to the fiber\u2019s hydrophilic character. When chitosan is mixed into the PLA, complete degradation no longer requires a long soil burial period (Vasile et al. 2018).</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4>\nImproving plastic polymers is key to a more sustainable planet. The production of PLA, though costly and intensive, provides an eco-friendly alternative to traditional polymers. As global climate change becomes increasingly drastic, the pursuit of more environmentally viable production methods becomes more important. Targeting specific biodegradation methods and modifying the composites are both viable options. Modifications using chitosan appear to be the most promising, but plasticizing has also improved PLA quality. With additional modifications, PLA has the potential to become an economical source of renewable and biodegradable packaging material.</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4>\nElsawy, M.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s note</h4></p>\n<p>This piece was written for my upper division university writing class, Writing in the Sciences. We were required to write a review article on a topic of our choice, and I chose the relationship between genetic diversity and disturbance of <i>Zostera marina</i>. I decided to pursue this topic because I was concurrently working in a molecular ecology eelgrass lab on campus, and I believed to get the most out of this lab experience I should have a good grasp of the current research that is already published and what still needs to be published within the subject. I hope this review gives readers a better understanding of where we now stand in eelgrass molecular ecology research, just as it did for myself.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1697\"></span><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p>Environmental disturbance is an expected function of all ecosystems and has been known to influence community structure and dynamics. Considerable research has drawn conclusions about the effects that diversity has on disturbance response in the eelgrass species <i>Zostera marina</i>. Studies have shown a positive effect of genetic diversity on disturbance response, in both grazing and temperature disturbance experiments. This review gives background information on this relationship and synthesizes the previous knowledge of diversity on disturbance response in eelgrass communities. Studies looking at the reverse of this relationship, disturbance effects on diversity, are mentioned; however the research is insufficient and lacking. With disturbance frequency expecting to rise in the future, understanding how disturbance influences the patterns and distribution of genetic diversity is essential to maintaining the biodiversity of <i>Z. marina. </i>This review concludes with key questions that remain before we can fully understand the association between disturbance and genetic diversity in the eelgrass species <i>Z. marina. </i></p>\n<p>Keywords: <i>genetic diversity; disturbance; eelgrass; seagrass; disturbance response; Zostera marina</i></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p>Seagrass is a foundation species that provides many benefits to both humans and coastal ecosystems. A dominant seagrass species is the eelgrass <i>Zostera marina</i>, which, as an ecosystem engineer, contributes largely to nutrient cycling, habitat provision, and primary productivity [1]. With some of the most productive marine plant communities being species poor, including seagrass, and with anthropomorphic disturbances expected to increase, it is important to understand the effects that these circumstances will have on the genetic diversity of foundation species such as <i>Z. marina </i>[2]. There has been significant research showing the positive effects of genetic diversity on eelgrass disturbance response, highlighting how important this diversity will be with increasing disturbance due to climate change [8]. However, there has been little research on the influence of disturbance on genetic diversity. This paper will outline the previous research published regarding the benefits of genetic diversity on disturbance response and will offer ideas for future research in the hopes of filling in gaps in our understanding of disturbance on genetic diversity of the eelgrass species.</p>\n<p><h4>Background</h4></p>\n<p>Ecological disturbance can be understood as any event that disrupts ecosystem community, affects population structure, changes resources, or alters the physical environment [9]. These ecological disturbances, which are inevitable features of nature, can have sizable impacts on ecosystem dynamics and structure. In 1979, Wayne Sousa sought to understand ecological disturbance through a manipulated experiment. Sousa looked at algal succession on boulders, assuming the smaller the boulder, the more disturbance it would experience due to incoming waves. The results showed that the frequency at which the rock was overturned was correlated with the difference in species composition. In other words, the amount of disturbance received was responsible for the difference in the algal species diversity [7]. This finding is helpful information, but with many marine plant communities being species limited, it is more important to know about the relationship between disturbance and diversity on the genetic level [6].</p>\n<p><h4>Effects of Genetic Diversity on Temperature Disturbance Response</h4></p>\n<p>A clear correlation can be seen between genetic diversity of eelgrass and disturbance response. Thorsten Reusch set up a manipulated experiment recording shoot density of <i>Z. marina</i> with plots of four different genotypic variation [6]. When a heat wave came to the area where the plots were planted, the plots with higher genetic diversity responded better to the disturbance, showing increased levels of total shoot count and biomass. Following up this study, Reusch designed a new experiment again testing the effects of genetic diversity on temperature disturbance response. Since the first experiment\u2019s disturbance was natural, this study would be the first of its kind to conduct a simulated heat wave on eelgrass to see if genetic diversity could buffer the losses due to heat. The results showed both that the warming had a negative impact on the shoot density and that the more genetically diverse plots responded better to this disturbance [1]. Both of these studies build off of each other to show the benefits that genetic diversity of eelgrass species can have to rising sea water temperatures. This is significant research, with a recent study detecting an acceleration of sea surface temperature rise during the 20th century [10]. As temperatures continue to rise, understanding the benefits that genetic diversity can have on the response to thermal disturbance will be essential in future policy decisions for eelgrass communities and coastal ecosystems.</p>\n<p><h4>Effects of Genetic Diversity on Grazing Disturbance Response</h4></p>\n<p>On a different spectrum of disturbance, grazing is also a common impact that negatively affects eelgrass communities. Knowing the ecosystem services provided by <i>Z. marina</i>, it is important that we also understand the effects of genetic diversity on herbivory response. Randall Hughes and John Stachowicz aimed to do so by planting four different diversity treatments: one, two, four, and eight genotypes, and recording shoot density as a measure of ecosystem function over a ten-month period. The grazing disturbance was due to Brant Geese, and the experiment showed similar results to that of the temperature disturbance experiments. There was no effect of genetic diversity on shoot density prior to the disturbance, but following the grazing event, a greater shoot density was found among the plots with higher genetic diversity [4]. In 2011, Hughes and Stachowicz wanted to test the effects of genetic diversity of eelgrass as a response to disturbance over a short period of time with a controlled disturbance, and over a long period of time with a natural disturbance. The controlled disturbance was achieved through clipping the shoots and the natural disturbance was due to a bloom of macro algae that caused a significant amount of shoot loss in the eelgrass beds. With regards to the experimental disturbance, diversity effects were shown in disturbance resilience (measured as shoot-regrowth) following the experiment. The polycultures showed greater increases in shoot density than expected at the highest level of disturbance. When observing the results of the natural disturbance, researchers found that the polycultures lost less biomass than the monocultures [5]. With increasing human disturbances leading to a loss of eelgrass diversity, these studies show the importance of preserving their genetic diversity if humans want to continually benefit from the species [4].</p>\n<p><h4>Effects of Disturbance on Genetic Diversity</h4></p>\n<p>While the benefits were observed of genetic diversity on disturbance response, Reusch was the first to study the inverse of this relationship in 2006. Reusch wanted to test three things: whether the physical disturbance would increase the genotypic diversity of <i>Z. marina</i> through an increased number of sexual recruits, if changes in genotypic diversity depend on the intensity of the physical disturbance, and whether disturbance would cause less competitive genotypes to be released from competition. The vegetation removal (disturbance) was controlled and the genotypic composition was monitored for two years. The results showed more sexual recruitment (represented by more shoots with new genotypes) and increased genet dynamics (represented by increased change in genotypic diversity) [11]. These results could be explained by the disturbance clearing neighboring shoots, allowing for less competition and more sunlight for the new seedlings and eventually more genotypes in the eelgrass bed. Recently, however, a study by Randall Hughes looked at the influence of genetic diversity on seedling biomass in the eelgrass species <i>Z. marina.</i> The results proved similar to Reusch\u2019s, but without any manipulated disturbance. The seedlings from the polycultures had larger shoots compared to the seedlings from the monoculture [3]. This finding diminishes the importance of the results to the Reusch study, showing that even without disturbance there may be more sexual recruitment due to higher genetic diversity. With Reusch\u2019s results now not completely understood, it is even more vital that we spend more energy and resources on this relationship between disturbance on genetic diversity.</p>\n<p><h4>Outstanding Questions</h4></p>\n<p>As stressed above, there have been years of research completed about the effects of genetic diversity on disturbance response in <i>Z. marina</i>, but there is still research yet to be pursued about how disturbance influences their genetic diversity. We have evidence from Reusch\u2019s 2006 paper that disturbance may increase genotypic diversity, but with the latest results of the Hughes study, more work needs to be done [3]. We have yet to test many variables: repeated disturbance, different intensities of disturbance, natural disturbance, long-term disturbance, multiple disturbances, and so on. In addition, we know that grazing disturbance decreases the competition above ground, and we should attempt to understand how the competition below ground is affected and its impact on genotypic diversity.</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p>Disturbance is an important ecological process, but its effect on eelgrass diversity is relatively unknown. Recent research shows the possible influences disturbance may have on seedling recruitment, which leads to genotypic diversity, but there is much more to be studied about this association. Once more is cumulatively understood and tested, we will have a better idea of how to prepare for forthcoming disturbances and plan mitigation strategies for eelgrass communities.</p>\n<p><h4>Works Cited</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reusch, T.B.H., Ehlers, A., Haemmerli, A. &amp; Worm, B.

Upon coming across the large initiative that a team at Harvard University is spearheading, I was interested whether robotic bees are the future of agriculture and moreover part of the tidal wave of automation.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1702\"></span><h4>Honeybees A Background on Capabilities and Need</h4></p>\n<p>Understanding the contribution honey bees provide to the ecosystem and humans sets the parameters for the Robobee project at Harvard University. Honeybees are known as a keystone species; they are organisms that play a disproportionate role in an ecosystem relative to their population size. According to a study done by Yale University, one third of crops are directly dependent on the pollination of honey bees [3]. This number does not even account for the crops that are indirectly aided by bee pollination. Just in 2010 alone, honeybees and other similar insects contributed approximately $29 billion dollars to the agricultural sector in the United States [4]. Therefore, what makes these pollinators particularly special?</p>\n<p>Each plant species requires a unique pollinator. While bird or mammalian pollinators are too large, an average colony of 50,000 bees provides a precise efficiency[2,5]. The Forest Service at the United States of Agriculture notes that the unique hairs surrounding many bee species and the honey bees\u2019 attentiveness to each flower allows for massive cross-pollination that cultivates healthy future plant generations [6].</p>\n<p>External factors, such as overuse of harmful pesticides, loss of habitat, and parasites \u00a0have led to colony collapse disorder (CCD). This is when worker bees leave the hive and never return due to either contracting pathogens, being affected by harmful chemicals, or a sudden change in habitat. Eventually, food reserves begin to dwindle and the queen is left to fend for herself, oftentimes dying and causing the hive to completely shutdown. CCD has resulted in some colonies facing up to a seventy to eighty percent loss [2, 7]. Many farmers are out of options as honeybees are struggling to survive due to many of the listed causes. As populations diminish, there can be serious consequences for the agricultural industry. Food production will decline, leading to a drastic loss in revenue, and causing many socioeconomic groups to suffer. A group of Harvard University researchers hope to address this impending problem by providing an automated solution.</p>\n<p><h4>Recent Developments</h4></p>\n<p>Harvard\u2019s Wyss Institute has so far mimicked most of nature\u2019s design where it comes to efficient pollinators\u2014 with some modifications. As a whole, Robert Wood and his team at the Wyss Institute hope to develop \u201cautonomous micro-aerial vehicles capable of self-contained, self-directed flight and of achieving coordinated behavior in large groups\u201d [9]. The RoboBee will have the potential to pollinate and provide aid to search and rescue missions. To build the robot, the plan has been broken down into three parts: the brain, the body, and the colony. The brain is aimed to be a collection of \u201csmart\u201d sensors that imitate a bee\u2019s eyes and antennae. In addition, the brain is designed to sense and respond dynamically to the environment.</p>\n<p>The body allows the robotic insects to fly on their own when integrated with a compact power source [9]. So far, the latest model of RoboBee weighs less than a tenth of a gram, and measures at half the size of a paper clip. The overall design of the body has been mostly inspired by the physique of a fly to provide certain aerodynamic attributes. The submillimeter anatomy and two wings allows the instrument to flap its wings 120 times per second to provide hovering, agile steering, and vertical takeoff [8,9]. Three-pronged feet attached to the main component of the body are utilized to collect pollen with accomodations made to carry additional weight [12]. Moreover, researchers have found a way to make the body more robust by allowing the robotic insects to transition between air and water. Using versatile propulsive strategies that can overcome different physical constraints, developers have created lightweight electrolytic plates that produce oxyhydrogen from the water. A sparker is then able to ignite the oxyhydrogen that allows the bees to transition from water to air as the robot is able to impulsively take off [8].</p>\n<p>The colony feature in the RoboBee is able to coordinate with other insect robots so that all systems act as a single unit. This is key as bees are most efficient when they work closely with their colony [5]. Papers published by Robert Wood\u2019s team reveals that the end goal is to create colonies that are fully autonomous, although they continue to face lingering problems.</p>\n<p><h4>A Few Questions to Consider</h4></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the Wyss team has come a long way in the last ten years. However, the team is facing a new challenge. In the mission to create a tool that is as small as a honeybee, it has become increasingly difficult to \u201cintegrate a compact powersource\u201d [10]. The robot is so small that it becomes more susceptible to environmental pressures such as wind, rain and unpredictable circumstances [8,10]. The only way to offset some of the listed issues is through even more power. In the last few years, materials science has come a long way to try and address some of these problems, but researchers working on the project will need a long term and reliable power solution to provide functionality for the intended purpose of pollination. In Robert Wood\u2019s Lab, the RoboBee is only able to work when tethered to an energy source. Wyss researcher Kevin Ma thinks it can be another ten years before we see the RoboBee in action [13]. While the initiative still has a ways to go, many critics of the project have brought another perspective to the idea in the meantime.</p>\n<p>The end goal behind the RoboBee is not only to supply pollination, but also to provide aid to search and rescue operations, and environmental monitoring. Some say that introducing more technology will not solve problems faced in the agricultural industry [11]. Furthermore, in our quest to patch a problem that has blossomed by many man-made variables, will we become complacent in our fight for environmental conservation and protection? As colony collapse disorder continues to diminish many bee populations, agriculturists may not have any other choice but to rely on RoboBees to tackle our immediate needs in the not so distant future.</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Thomas, Pat. \u201cGive Bees a Chance.\u201d <i>The Ecologist</i>, The Ecologist, 11 Feb. 2008.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultured meat has been a topic of great discussion as we try to understand the extent to which animal agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues. While plant-based imitation meats have been on the market for decades, I was particularly interested in this lab-grown alternative when I heard that stem cells were being used to produce actual meat without having to raise animals themselves. This could potentially reduce the environmental footprint of the agricultural industry while providing a viable solution for consumers. While it is critical to understand how consumption levels of animal-based products have had an effect on health, and particularly how the change in consumption of these products have changed average human health, my research focused more on how traditional meat impacts environmental health and how cultured meat can help mitigate some of these problems. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Trends in Meat Consumption</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Animals used for meat and other foods were first domesticated between 15,000 and 5,000 years ago [1,2] when this practice evolved into animal agriculture. The shift from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to an agricultural one meant a steady and growing food supply. The increase in wealth, which fuels factory farming, usage of fertilizers, and technological and genetic advancements, have expanded food availability across various regions around the world, thus increasing consumption [3]. In the Mediterranean, mean availability of animal products such as meats, animal fats, fish and seafood increased from 268.4 kilocalories per person per day during the period of 1961-1965 to 531.1 kilocalories per person per day during the 2000-2004 period; similar trends were also seen for Northern and Central Europe [4]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since 1963, consumption has been on the rise by a considerable 62 percent throughout the world, with the strongest increase in developed nations. In general, countries like the United Kingdom and United States were found to primarily source pigs, sheep, and cattle. Developing regions like the Middle East, Africa, and India mainly produced goat and camel meats; however, non-animal-based sources of protein were still found to be dominant [3]. Countries such as China and Brazil that have enjoyed economic growth also show ninefold and threefold increases, respectively, in meat consumption including cattle since 1963. Thus, researchers have found a strong correlation between economic growth and increased meat intake. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">John Kearney at the Dublin Institute for Technology expects food consumption to be on the rise through 2050 and claims trends show that meat will be no different. The major drivers of this forecast are food availability, accessibility, and choice. Disposable income, urbanization, globalization, marketing, religion, culture, and consumer attitudes are all causes of such drivers. After 1.7 billion livestock are raised, transported, and processed, 300 million tons of meat are produced every year [6,8]. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Environmental Impact</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Increased consumption of animal-based products proves to have major environmental consequences due to its inefficient process. Meat production requires significant inputs of land, water, food, and energy to support multiple steps. The process begins with growing sufficient crops to feed livestock; an estimated 75 percent of the world\u2019s agricultural land goes into meat production [6]. In Central America alone, 40 percent of rainforest land has been cleared in the last 40 years for cattle pasture to meet the demands of the export market \u2014 often times the United States [7]. Furthermore, Harold Mooney from Stanford University\u2019s Woods Institute estimates that one-third of the world\u2019s total arable land is utilized to support livestock in some shape or form [8]. Over time, the land is depleted from wind and soil erosion caused by over-farming and overgrazing. The environmental costs do not end here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On average, one pound of meat requires between 5,000 and 20,000 liters of water for direct and indirect use [6,10]. In the United States, 25 trillion liters of water are used for animal feed alone [10]. After everything is processed, researchers have found that in the U.S. 40 percent of freshwater is deemed unfit for drinking or recreational use due to contamination by microorganisms, fertilizers, and pesticides. For example, total phosphorus excretions of many livestock are seven to nine times greater than that of humans, resulting in disastrous effects to surrounding ecosystems. Furthermore, runoff from manure fosters an ideal environment for a number of waterborne pathogens. Case studies in China, India, the U.S., and Denmark indicate that \u201canimal waste is a leading factor in pollution of land and water resources\u201d [11]. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) proliferate these issues as dense groups of livestock are raised in very confined conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that livestock, including poultry, accounts for 14.5 percent of anthropogenic (human-induced) greenhouse gas emissions. About 44 percent of the emissions are from methane, 29 percent from nitrous oxide, and 27 percent from carbon dioxide. Methane is 28 to 36 times more effective than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and nitrous oxide is 265 to 298 times more effective than carbon dioxide [8,14]. Research led by the University of Oxford and University of Amsterdam found that producing beef consumed the greatest amount of energy, land, and water, and it emitted the greatest amount of greenhouse gases relative to sheep, pork, and poultry. Concern is rising as the population is expected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050, causing many to consider solutions that can help mitigate and prevent the effects of animal agriculture. One such emerging solution is cultured meat, otherwise known as in vitro meat.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Cultured Meat, Myogenesis, and Choosing the Most Applicable Stem Cell</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultured meat, which goes by a variety of names \u2014 in vitro meat, synthetic meat, lab-grown meat \u2014 is meat that is grown from cell culture rather than a full-fledged animal. In Vitro Meat Production System (IMPS) utilizes the same protocol for tissue engineering techniques that are traditionally used in regenerative medicine. The first cultured burger made out of cow muscle was made by Mark Post in 2013 from Maastricht University in the Netherlands, with some modifications made since then. There are a number of ways to produce cultured meat such as the Self-organization technique, where muscle cells are maintained in vitro and nourished with the suitable nutrients, or the Scaffold-based technique, which utilizes stem cells that are allowed to be differentiated and grown into muscle tissue in vitro [19]. Initiating the Scaffold-based technique calls for the best possible stem cells to be utilized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At first, embryonic stem cells may seem to be the most obvious choice for IMPS, since they provide virtually unlimited regenerative potential. However, genetic mutations have proven to limit the \u201cproduction potential\u201d of an embryonic stem cell [19]. Once stimulated, these cells do not necessarily retain the same proliferative characteristics; therefore, it has not been possible to culture cells with \u201cinfinite self-renewal capacity\u201d [19]. The next option is myosatellite cells, also called satellite cells, which are found in muscle tissue that are repeatedly able to conduct the process of myogenesis, otherwise known as muscle generation, with \u201chigh efficacy.\u201d Moreover, satellite cells have been proven to be integral because they \u201cfulfill the criteria for a true somatic stem cell: self-renewal and the ability to generate progeny of several distinct cell types\u201d [18,19].</span></p>\n<p><h4>Isolation and Proliferation of Satellite Cells</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For the purposes of producing meat for edible consumption, researchers at various institutions have aimed to produce skeletal muscle. Satellite cells, which are found next to the muscle cells, are isolated from the animal following a biopsy [16,17]. In this step, a sample of skeletal muscle is collected from the organism and approximately 100 cells are isolated. Since these specific cells become activated in response to an injury or stress, they can be harnessed to grow muscle cells for consumption. Once isolated, proliferation can begin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During proliferation, the goal is to produce as many satellite cells as possible in order to activate them to transition into myocytes or tubular muscle cells. A culture medium with the appropriate growth factor promotes the culturing of the stem cells. Generally, the medium is sourced from an adult, newborn, or foetus animal. The growth factor is made via muscle cells coupled with other cells types such as hepatocytes [18,19]. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Differentiation, Fusion, Polishing, and the End Result</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To enter differentiation, a change in medium is required to meet the changing demands of the new cells [17,19]. Unfortunately, the medium contributes to the high expenditure required towards overall costs as it requires regular replenishing from Fetal Calf Serum, which often raises ethical concerns. Many question the ethics as the serum is sourced from calves, and each calf can only produce a relatively small amount. Alternatives like sphingosine 1-phosphate and amino-acid rich mushroom extracts have been suggested for the serum-based media to replace the Fetal Calf Serum [19]. Over time the satellite cells will become myoblasts, otherwise called activated satellite cells. With continuous replenishment of serum the myoblasts differentiate into myscotytes. These long tubular cells form muscles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An edible or non-edible non-animal-based scaffold is used to help the cells attach to a surface. Additionally, a scaffold that imitates tissue-like flexibility and stiffness will mimic in vivo conditions the best. As the cells are allowed to contract, further differentiation can occur [19]. Polymers like collagen or cellulose have been suggested as the basis for the scaffold since they may provide the most life-like circumstance. The myocytes fuse together to form myotubes, which eventually becomes a body of skeletal muscle. The cells need to be continuously allowed to contract in order to avoid atrophy, a condition of muscle wasting. Electrical stimulation coupled with the scaffold has been shown to be resourceful in some organisms [19]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> For large-scale productions the usage of a bioreactor is necessary to provide the adequate conditions. Lastly, to provide a texture and flavor similar to traditional meat, Edelman et. al have suggested co-culturing myoblasts with fat cells [20]. However, other methods include mixing the meat with fat cells and additives to mimic farmed meat.</span></p>\n<p><h4>The Implications</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers from the University of Oxford and the University of Amsterdam have found a substantial decrease in negative environmental impacts from large-scale production of cultured meat in comparison to its traditional counterparts of beef, sheep, pork, and poultry meat. The production of 1000 kg of cultured meat requires 7 to 45 percent lower energy use than traditional meat, except for poultry, which requires less than cultured meat. The study shows 78 to 96 percent less greenhouse gas emissions, 99 percent less land use, and 82 to 96 percent less water usage with cultured meat. Variation in percentage points were attributed to the different organisms that cultured meat was compared to [15].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is crucial to note that the protocols required to make cultured meat in IMPS require components from animals that still need to be farmed \u2014 for the time being. Acquisition of satellite cells require muscle samples, and the medium required to culture the cells, Fetal Calf Serum, shows that lab grown meat is not quite independent of traditional animal agriculture. However, with advancements in tissue engineering and improvements made to the techniques, it may be possible to bring cultured meat to market that no longer requires animal farming.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dunn, Margery G.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Authors note</h4> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">UC Davis does an immense amount of waste reduction and energy conservation practices, but after writing this essay in my Water Quality at Risk class I wondered if it is enough. \u00a0In 2018, UC Davis did not make it on the \u201cCool Schools\u201d list by Sierra Club Magazine. The previous year we were ranked as number 32. I was assigned this essay to compare some of the practices that UC Davis does with other schools to get an understanding on what we are excelling at and where we can improve. I chose to focus on how we can improve in regards to water waste with an implementation of porous concrete.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Widely acclaimed for its expertise and leadership in environmental sustainability, the University of California, Davis has a multitude of practices in action to keep a green and ecologically friendly campus. \u00a0These practices include transformations in agriculture, utilities, education, and student involvement. An agricultural change at UC Davis that has greatly reduced water waste is the switch to a low-water landscape in the arboretum. \u00a0A recent implementation of UC Verde Buffalo Grass which was developed by Meghan Call and Kevin Siew at UC Davis and UC Riverside requires only 25 percent the amount of water used for other turf grasses [5]. Additionally, utility advancements on campus have been made by eliminating single-pass cooling, which disposes of water after one-time use, for laboratory equipment in favor of closed-loop systems, which reuse and recycle the water. UC Davis has also adopted practices such as trayless dining and using refrigerators to defrost frozen food instead of water, which has reduced the university\u2019s water consumption during mealtimes. Currently, one-third of our campus fixtures have been replaced with low flow versions, thus resulting in less water usage than the conventional model. We also have 35 hydration stations on campus, discouraging the use of bottled water which conserves energy by reducing the amount of raw materials needed to produce bottle water [7]. There is also opportunity for UC Davis students to get involved with sustainability through the LEED-EBOM program that investigates leaks and water saving opportunities on campus. While UC Davis has a range of green practices put in place, with their score of 43/70 for water and their removal from the list of top environmental campuses it is evident that there is much needed improvement. By looking at the innovations and changes done by other schools, UC Davis has an extensive amount of potential changes that could be implemented to improve the campus\u2019s eco-friendly presence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While exploring the rankings on the Sierra Club page, both Vanderbilt University and Sacramento State scored 70/70 \u00a0in 2017 in the category of \u201cWater\u201d due to their latest advancements in water sustainability. After researching their practices, I found options that UC Davis could attempt. Vanderbilt University has installed waterfree urinals that work by urine falling down the drain via an internal trap filled with a liquid chemical as opposed to water. Each waterless urinal can save up to 40,000 gallons of water each year [8]. Sacramento State has also improved their water conservation and in 2015 won the Urban Project Development Award in 2015 for implementing porous concrete. When water such as rainfall runoff runs over the porous concrete, it is able to be absorbed through the concrete and go directly into a gravel bed below and then subsequently become groundwater. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inspired by Sacramento State\u2019s implementation and by the success of porous concrete cited by the \u201cInternational Journal of Transportation Science and Technology\u201d \u00a0a proposed change for UC Davis is to execute porous concrete [6]. Permeable pavement has the ability to control stormwater with more feasibility, improve water quality, and reduce urban heat island impact on the local environment of UC Davis. Traditional impermeable pavement causes water to run off much faster than it does for vegetated surfaces, which can cause overflow of storm water collection systems. Whereas, permeable pavements allow a larger amount of stormwater to pass through the surface and be absorbed into the ground below [1]. This would also minimize or even eliminate the need for stormwater and collection systems, decreasing the energy usage drastically. Based off of North Carolina State University Permeable Pavement Research, they found that permeable pavements reduce runoff percentage by about 98%, whereas standard concrete only reduced 32% of runoff [1]. They estimated that the cost of installing porous concrete versus hot mix asphalt would save a total of 64,649.66 dollars over a 25 year span for a halfacre of porous concrete over asphalt [2]. Though conventional asphalt has a lower installation cost, the cost to maintain it is significantly higher than the upkeep of permeable pavements due to cracking and patching of worn out surfaces [2]. The only regular upkeep needed for permeable pavements is vacuuming so that the surface water continues to permeate to the underlying soil. This cost to effectuate permeable pavements should be covered by UC Davis as it is strategic to them in the long run due to the fact that they would no longer have to pay for preservation of conventional pavement with permeable pavement, practically paying for itself overtime. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Porous concrete not only saves the quantity of water, but also will improve water quality by decreasing the temperature of the water and the number of pollutants discharged into surface waters [2]. This is due to water flowing directly underground and avoiding picking up particles from the street. Standard paved surfaces reflect solar heat and create an urban heat island (UHI) \u00a0because of the elevated temperature located within a region [2]. Permeable pavements are generally a lower contributor to the UHI effect in regions that have hot weather. This will create cooler stormwater runoff and will positively impact nearby biological communities by reducing the amount of higher temperature water that they receive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some potential concerns are extra cost when focusing solely on the concrete, moisture damage that can occur due to water getting stuck within the concrete, and an increase risk of groundwater contamination. The extra cost associated with the pavement will overtime pay for itself due to replacing the costs of maintaining a stormwater management system. An example of this is in Garden Valley, Washington where a modeling study was conducted, the EPA found that their cost comparison between conventional development cost and their cost for installing and up keep of pervious pavement saved $63,700 [6]. Some potential problems associated with permeable pavement has been prevented. If moisture damage does occur, it can be reduced by the addition of an anti-strip additive treatment which increases the bonding strength between asphalt and the aggregate. Concerning filtration through the porous concrete, a study has been done at the Edison Environmental Center where the EPA\u2019s Urban Watershed Management Branch has been monitoring the permeable pavement demonstration site. \u00a0The results showed that the amount of Total Organic Carbon in the infiltrate, which should be less than 25 ppm, was reduced, meaning that the permeable pavement retained TOC </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[6]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This leads to less organic carbon in the water collected. Overall, the installation of permeable pavements is a valuable choice when compared to common asphalt. The advantages that come with having permeable surfaces outweigh the disadvantages and makes it an attractive alternative to UC Davis as it constitutes a more sustainable and cost effective option. This implementation would be favorable to putting UC Davis back on the Sierra Club Rankings for the most environmental schools.</span></p>\n<p>References</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hunt, William F, and Eban Z Bean. \u201cNC State University Permeable Pavement Research and<br/>\nChanges to the State of NC Runoff Credit System.\u201d<br/>\nwww.perviouspavement.org/downloads/ncsu_study.pdf.</li>\n<li>Kayhanian, Masoud, et al. \u201cThe Application of Permeable Pavement with Emphasis on Successful<br/>\nDesign, Water Quality Benefits, and Identification of Knowledge and Data Gaps.\u201d June 2015,<br/>\nncst.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/09-30-2015-NCST-SR-Permeable-Pavement-FINALv5.pdf.</li>\n<li>Kirk, Camille, and David Phillips. \u201cUC Davis Drought Response Action Plan.\u201d Apr. 2014,<br/>\nsustainability.ucdavis.edu/local_resources/docs/drought_response_action_plan_april_2014.pdf.</li>\n<li>Call, Meghan, et al.

        "title": "A Chemical Report on Heptachlor (Heptachlor Epoxide)",
        "author": "Kaiming Tan",
        "date": "08/16/2019",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This report analyzes and explains the biological, chemical, and environmental importance of heptachlor. More and more in today\u2019s society, we are utilizing synthetic compounds as agricultural insecticides, which makes understanding what these chemicals do to our bodies and the environment of utmost importance. Farming strategies may seem far-removed from our daily lives, but these chemicals do not stay on the farm. They travel to our cities, to our grocery stores and markets, then make their way onto our dinner plates and into our children\u2019s stomachs. I am constantly amazed at the power of scientific research to transform and demystify the detrimental nature of environmental and biological toxicants; this, combined with my passion in toxicology, has inspired me to research this topic and write this manuscript.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Keywords</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, insecticide, environmental toxicology, biological toxin</span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heptachlor was introduced into the United States in the 1940s and 1950s, among the other chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides, such as DDT (4). In 1971, 500,000 kilograms of heptachlor were applied to agricultural fields in soils and seeds to prevent termite infection in woods (4). However, after it became evident that heptachlor\u2019s toxicity was a serious health concern, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned all registered use of heptachlor because of its carcinogenic properties and bioaccumulation in food and water. With the exception of treatment of fire ants in underground power transformers, there is no use of heptachlor in the United States now (2). In contrast, heptachlor is still used as an insecticide in some areas in Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe (5). The form of greater toxicological concern is heptachlor epoxide, which is a metabolite of heptachlor in soil and the human body. Heptachlor epoxide is more toxic because it degrades slower than heptachlor, thus, is more persistent in the environment. Both heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide can be found in freshwater, estuarine, and marine systems (6). This review will cover the current literature on heptachlor toxicity and investigate the impact of heptachlor on biological systems.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Biological Fate (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination)</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Humans and animals can be exposed to heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide through soil, air and water; however, the main route of exposure is oral, through consuming contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. Children and infants are especially vulnerable to heptachlor exposure if they consume large amounts of breast milk from their mother. For instance, if the mother\u2019s breast milk is contaminated by heptachlor, heptachlor can be easily consumed by the infant through breast milk feeding. In human breast milk, heptachlor epoxide was detected ranging from 0.13 to 128 ppb (parts per billion) (8). Another route of exposure is through inhalation. When heptachlor is deposited into the soil, it becomes heptachlor epoxide, which then spreads into the air. As a result, workers who use heptachlor to kill termites are potentially susceptible to inhaling heptachlor epoxide from the air (2). In addition, touching contaminated soils causes exposure to heptachlor dermally (1).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heptachlor persists in the environment after agricultural application. Even though there was no information on the background levels of heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide in the air or soil, there are 20 to 800 ppt (parts per trillion) heptachlor in drinking water and groundwater in the United States (2). Contaminated fish and shellfish were detected with levels of 2 to 750 ppb of heptachlor and 0.1 to 480 ppb of heptachlor epoxide. To date, there is no available data regarding the biological fate of heptachlor on humans. However, in rats, at least 50% of the orally-administered dose of heptachlor is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.The absorption is indicated by the presence of heptachlor and/or heptachlor epoxide in the rats\u2019 liver (9). When heptachlor epoxide enters the bloodstream after absorption, it becomes the predominant metabolite in the body of laboratory female rats. Heptachlor epoxide in the bloodstream is positively correlated to the heptachlor dose administered (10). In other words, the higher heptachlor dose one consumed, the more heptachlor epoxide would appear in the bloodstream.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because of heptachlor epoxide\u2019s high lipophilicity (likelihood in dissolving fats), its residue is found highest in adipose tissue in human infants (0.32\u00b10.10ppm), while undetectable in the brain. These data also suggest that heptachlor epoxide can be transferred between pregnant women and their babies through the placenta (11). Furthermore, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide can be stored in human breast milk. Jonsson et al.\u2019s study in 1977 sampled the breast milk of 51 women who had no previously known exposure to heptachlor and detected an average concentration of heptachlor epoxide between 0.0027ppm and 0.019ppm (12). To the researchers, the results proved worrisome as the women\u2019s breast milk contained high levels of heptachlor, which could damage the infant. The results were even more of a concern because there was no known interaction between the women studied and heptachlor.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After heptachlor is absorbed in the body, the primary metabolite of heptachlor in humans and rats is heptachlor epoxide. Heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide are usually metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. CYP450 enzymes are the body\u2019s major class of enzymes responsible for detoxification. Moreover, heptachlor alters liver function by increasing gluconeogenic enzymes\u2019 activities, which upregulates glucose synthesis from glycogen. Since most of heptachlor is metabolized in the liver, humans with liver diseases may have increased bioaccumulation of heptachlor epoxide because of decreased CYP450 enzyme activity (13). Despite the metabolism of heptachlor in the liver, most heptachlor epoxide can be stored in the adipose tissue because of its high lipophilicity and long half-life (1).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In terms of excretion, orally-administered heptachlor in rats was excreted in the form of heptachlor epoxide and also as heptachlor. Radiolabeled heptachlor epoxide is excreted ten times more in the feces compared to urine after ten days of oral administration in rats, due to the high lipophilicity of heptachlor metabolites (8).</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mechanism of Action</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The primary organ and organ systems that heptachlor targets are the liver, central nervous system and reproductive system, while secondary target organs include kidneys and lungs. Heptachlor is primarily metabolized in the liver into heptachlor epoxide, which has the same toxic potential. The reproductive system is a sensitive target for heptachlor toxicity because this system lacks a comprehensive detoxification system like the CYP450 enzymes in liver. CYP450 enzymes facilitate chemical reactions that chemically convert the toxicant into a more hydrophilic metabolite, thereby enhancing toxicant elimination by urine. Oral exposure of 1.8 mg/kg/day to female rats over 14 days caused decreased fertility due to decreased estradiol and progesterone levels. Estradiol and progesterone are important hormones produced by the ovaries, placenta, and adrenal glands; decreased levels may result in endocrine disruption and delayed sexual development. Oral exposure of 0.65 mg/kg/day over 70 days caused decreased sperm count in male rats. The mechanism of heptachlor\u2019s reproductive toxicity remains unknown (1-2).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GABA, the molecule that normally binds the GABA receptor, is an amino acid which can also serve as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Heptachlor primarily acts as a noncompetitive antagonist of the chloride channels of the GABA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> receptors in mammals.\u00a0 In other words, heptachlor blocks the Chlorine channel in the cells thus preventing GABA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> activation (1-2, 14). By inhibiting the inhibitory neuron, heptachlor causes hyperexcitability of the cells. Although the heptachlor toxicity mechanism in liver is unknown, it is observed that in rats that presence of heptachlor elevates intracellular calcium levels and induces protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn activates the activator protein-1 DNA binding thereby causing tumorigenesis (2, 14).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When animals are exposed to heptachlor above the toxic threshold, symptoms occur including tremors, convulsions, ataxia, and changes in EEG patterns (1). Also, rats who were orally exposed to &gt;320 ppm of heptachlor had consistently lower body weight than rats that were unexposed (15). In humans, clinical symptoms of heptachlor toxicity include seizure, vomiting, and convulsions (2).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although heptachlor epoxide is theoretically an effective mutagen because of its high reactivity as an electrophile, research studies on heptachlor mutagenicity yielded mostly negative results. For example, heptachlor was not mutagenic in the auxotrophic strains of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by reversion bioassays (14,15). In addition, heptachlor is proven to increase liver tumor incidence as an epigenetic promoter in previously initiated B6C3F1 mice. Heptachlor is a carcinogen in mice by inhibiting intercellular communications to promote tumor growth (14,16). On the other hand, research studies that investigate heptachlor\u2019s teratogenicity, or tendency to disturb embryonic development, yielded mostly negative results. For instance, although feeding rats with diets containing heptachlor produces pups with higher mortality, no congenital malformation was found (2, 14, 17).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In male rats, oral LD</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">50</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (lethal dose for 50% of the study population) of heptachlor is 40 to 100 mg/kg body weight based on data from two studies. In contrast, the oral LD</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">50</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of heptachlor in male chickens is 62 mg/kg body weight (1, 17). Symptoms displayed by heptachlor acute toxicity in animal subjects include hyperexcitability, tremors, convulsions and paralysis (18).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Long-term exposure to heptachlor can cause liver damage in animals. In rats, prolonged exposure of sub-lethal doses of heptachlor is associated with increased CYP450 enzyme induction and other hepatic microsomal enzymes, in addition to liver hypertrophy (18). In humans, chronic exposure to heptachlor results in storage in adipose tissue and breast milk, because heptachlor is very lipophilic. Infants are at risk of being exposed to large doses of heptachlor if they consume contaminated breast milk (17). Despite the lack of human studies on long-term exposure, a multi-generation study conducted on rats concluded that oral exposure of 6 mg/kg/day of heptachlor is associated with decreased litter size, increased mortality and lens cataract (2). Because of its high lipophilicity, heptachlor residues can remain in the body over time. Heptachlor\u2019s long-term toxicity damages the body gradually, further underlying the need for strict regulations of heptachlor use worldwide.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Overview of Latest Research</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recent research on heptachlor focuses on its toxicity, specifically on the oxidative stress caused by heptachlor and its metabolism in aquatic animals. For example, Vineela et al.\u2019s study investigates the impact of sub-lethal concentrations of heptachlor on carp fish Catla catla by measuring enzymatic activities of mostly Phase II enzymes (19). Phase II enzymes, a part of the CYP450 enzyme class, primarily perform conjugation reactions to convert the chemical into more water-soluble form to enhance urine elimination. Oral exposure of heptachlor at 1.46mg/L (20% of LC50 concentration) for 45 days causes a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase and catalase activity in Catla catla. The results suggest that carp fish have a sensitive biological defense system against heptachlor, because low concentration activates the detoxification by increased biomarkers of primarily Phase II activity to prevent heptachlor toxicity and organ damage (19).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to heptachlor toxicity, current research also focuses on how to remove existing heptachlor from the environment via microbial degradation, as this method is more environmentally mindful and cost-effective than current physicochemical methods. Qiu et al.\u2019s study discovered a novel strain of bacteria, named strain H, that can metabolize heptachlor efficiently. Strain H is a Gram-negative, short rod-shaped, single-cell bacterial strain that can degrade heptachlor at a rate of 88.2% degradation in 130 hours when exposed to 300 \u03bcg/L of heptachlor at 30</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">o</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">C. The main metabolites of heptachlor by strain H include heptachlor epoxide, chlordane epoxide, and 1-hydroxychorodene. This innovation allows possible bioremediation by microorganisms like strain H in heptachlor-contaminated soil and water to reduce heptachlor toxicity and threat to the environment and animals (20).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recent studies on heptachlor took a creative approach in gaining a deeper understanding in reducing heptachlor toxicity by enzymatic activity in aquatic model organisms and inventing novel microorganisms to metabolize heptachlor into less toxic metabolites. These new techniques will benefit public health by developing cost-effective ways for toxicant removal and controlling the environmental/biological fate of toxicants without causing additional harm.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusions</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When initially used as an insecticide, heptachlor\u2019s toxicity became a threatening health concern. The ban of commercial heptachlor use in the United States was a step in the right direction, as misuse of heptachlor can cause severe environmental consequences such as prolonged residue in soil and water habitats along with toxicities in humans and animals. Based on this research, other countries should pursue a substitute pesticide that has less potential for environmental and biological damage than heptachlor.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most studies conducted regarding heptachlor toxicity were conducted between the 1950s and the late 1980s. Future research can focus on the dose-response relationship of heptachlor exposure within large populations and whether genetic polymorphism contributes to the metabolism of heptachlor. Environmental toxicologists can also study the synergistic toxicity of heptachlor on environmental damage with other pesticides, since common pesticides often contain more than one chemical (1,2).</span></p>\n<p><h4>Acknowledgment</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The author would like to thank Dr. Matthew Wood and Mr. Thomas Sears for providing feedback on early versions of this manuscript.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Works Cited (in order of appearance)</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reed, N.R., &amp; Koshlukova, S.

A uniquely global and increasingly relevant concern is how to continue to feed the world\u2019s growing population in the face of climate change. I decided to write this paper to provide a snapshot of the current research being done to innovate crop species that will survive in the face of climate change. As part of this review. I also wanted to address ongoing concerns about the safety and impact of GMOs on consumers and the environment, and whether these genetic engineering strategies have the potential to make a positive impact on food security.</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p>As the world population continues to rise, climate change is also having an increasingly large impact on agriculture in the form of rising temperatures and intensified weather variations. Population growth is challenging researchers and farmers to find new ways to increase crop yields without access to more land or freshwater. Population is expected to increase from the current 7.7 billion to 9 billion by 2050 (1,2). However, it was found in 2000 that about 70% of the available freshwater was already in use. Meanwhile, climate change is introducing new challenges to crop productivity and stability. By 2050, the global crop demand may increase as much as 110%, which emphasizes the need for new, powerful strategies for crop improvement.</p>\n<p>Genetically engineered crops have been used in agriculture since the mid-1990s, and have been instrumental in overcoming serious agricultural challenges such as disease outbreaks and overuse of toxic insecticides (3). In contrast to traditional breeding, genetic engineering allows for a direct transfer of one or more genes of interest from either closely or distantly related organisms. In some cases, a plant is modified solely by turning on or off one of its own genes (4). These methods allow for fast and precise changes that target a specific trait. Since their introduction, numerous studies have measured their potential for health and environmental risks, as well as their benefits. This review will discuss the impacts of genetically engineered crops from an environmental and health perspective. Additionally, I will look at how genetically engineered crops are currently being applied to address food security concerns in the face of climate change.</p>\n<p><h4>What is the Impact of Genetically Engineered Crops?</h4></p>\n<p><em>Environment</em></p>\n<p>As genetically engineered crops have now been used in the field for many years, the environmental impacts can be assessed. The most abundant type of genetically engineered crops are insect resistant crops, specifically Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) resistant corn and cotton. Bt is a soil bacterium which produces proteins that are toxic to certain insects (5). Bt crops have been modified to produce Bt genes as protection against specific pests (3). These crops have been grown commercially since 1996 (2), which has allowed long term environmental studies to be conducted. In a two-year field trial on the impact of transgenic maize on soil fauna, Fan et al. found that there was no impact on biodiversity, abundance or composition of the soil fauna. They compared samples taken in varying conditions from either transgenic maize or non-transgenic maize controls. The researchers found that the insecticide transgene did not affect the soil ecosystem, while factors such as time of year, pH, sampling time, and root-biomass all had significant effects (6). In a 2003 review on Bt crops, Mendelsohn et al. also found that there were no negative impacts observed on species of endangered insects, earthworms, or non-target insects. However, one negative that applies to all insecticides is that pests will eventually gain resistance. Engineering crop varieties to have several different resistance genes has been shown to slow this process (2).</p>\n<p>Another class of genetically modified crops that are currently in use are herbicide-tolerant crops. Herbicide-tolerant crops are designed to be tolerant to broad-spectrum herbicides that can be used to control surrounding weeds. Use of herbicide-tolerant corn and soybeans has been shown to decrease the use of highly toxic herbicide sprays in favor of an amino-acid derived, non-toxic alternative (Roundup), and has also encouraged low-till farming practices which have been correlated to significant reductions in greenhouse gasses (2). Weed resistance is a concern with herbicide-resistant crops, especially when a single herbicide gene is overused. In some cases, high selection pressures caused by overuse of a single broad-spectrum herbicide have led to resistant weeds. If unchecked, these resistant weeds can spread across farms and negatively impact crop growth (7). New varieties of crops resistant to multiple types of herbicides should help mitigate this problem by allowing farmers to rotate several types of herbicides. A widespread adaptation of these new varieties and consistent practice of sustainable herbicide application will be important to avoiding negative outcomes of herbicide-tolerant crop use.</p>\n<p>Implementing these genetically engineered crops has contributed to overall decreases in the amount of toxic insecticide and herbicide sprayed. Just as with chemical pesticide and herbicide sprays, proper steps must be taken with insect-resistant or herbicide-resistant crops to delay resistance in the affected insect or weed. These steps include rotating planting of herbicide-resistant crops and using weed control tactics with different modes of action to avoid putting high selection pressure on one type of resistance.</p>\n<p><em>Health</em></p>\n<p>The consensus from long term studies carried out to address biosafety concerns of genetically modified crops, is that they are just as safe as their natural counterparts. Genetically engineered crops are subjected to a variety of tests on a case by case basis before they are implemented, and now long term data shows that there have been no side effects from possible unintended chemical compositions of crops, making them just as safe as those derived from traditional breeding. There are, however, concerns about next generation genetic engineering, which targets regulator genes instead of a single functional gene. Targeting regulator genes could allow scientists to target plant stress response pathways, and engineer plants to have multiple desirable traits (8). Additional research must be conducted to assess the plant-wide changes caused by affecting a player in a signaling cascade.</p>\n<p><em>New Approaches to Crop Improvement</em></p>\n<p>While the current genetically engineered crops have been found to have a positive effect on crop yields, the increases are not enough to keep up with projected population growth. Additionally, climate change is predicted to cause stressors to crops such as drought, rising temperatures, and weather variations among other things (2). Therefore, scientists are looking for new and creative genetic engineering techniques to create robust and high-yielding crops for our future.</p>\n<p>One of the main targets for genetically engineered crops is adaptions to grow and produce quality yields under higher temperatures. In a study investigating the genes responsible for creating lower quality, chalky rice grains under high temperature conditions, Nakata et al. looked at the role of a starch metabolizing enzyme, known as amylase, in the packing of starch into rice grains. Their team used transgenic rice modified with a reporter gene attached to each isotype of the amylase gene. By comparing the activity of plants overexpressing each variety, they were able to identify specific amylase genes as targets for genetic modification. Rice variants with these modifications would remain higher quality, with tightly packed starch, even if grown under non-optimal higher temperatures (9). Another study tested the responses of a previously created transgenic rice line called HOSUT under high amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), a heat wave, and nitrogen enriched conditions. They found that the transgenic line, which has enhanced sucrose transport, has a superior yield than the control line (Certo), and that increased CO2 conditions resulted in higher yields in Certo with only minimal increases for HOSUT. They concluded that the minimal response of HOSUT to the increased CO2 was indicative of HOSUT already being saturated due to its optimized transport capabilities. The HOSUT line is already optimized for translocation of carbon, which they were able to show by increases in starch in the grains in HOSUT only. HOSUT also produced more yield in response to increased nitrogen, making it a good option for producing high rice yields under variable climate change conditions (10) The HOSUT line is a great example of how genetic engineering can be used to fortify and optimize crops to both survive under atypical conditions and produce enough yield to keep up with demand.</p>\n<p>Another problem that researchers are addressing through genetic engineering, is drought. Selvaraj et al., developed and field tested two drought tolerant rice lines, created by introducing an Arabidopsis stress response gene (galactinol synthase) with a maize promoter. Galactinol synthase produces galactinol, a sugar that functions as an osmoprotectant, keeping water from leaving the cells. These galactinol synthase genes were introduced into two commercially available rice lines and tested in the field under drought and well-watered conditions. Under drought conditions, the collection of galactinol resulted in higher grain yields, while under well-watered conditions no significant yield increase was observed. Galactinol is a sugar that functions as an osmoprotectant, keeping water from leaving the cells. The results of these field trials show that these rice lines are ready to be integrated into ongoing breeding programs (11). Wang et al. also tackled the problem of drought stress caused by global warming on fruit such as apple trees. They transgenically expressed an aquaporin gene found in Fuji apples that has increased expression during fruit growth in tomato. The transgenic plants did have an increased drought tolerance, observed as an increased sensitivity of their stomata to water loss, and a larger fruit size when compared to wild type. This research will be continued in apples next with the goal of producing plants with larger fruits when well-watered, which will also be more tolerant to drought due to increased water transport efficiency (12).</p>\n<p>A third target for genetic engineering solutions is circadian rhythms. Understanding and controlling circadian rhythms in crop plants has the potential to adapt plants to radically different environments. One group at the Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology is tackling this challenge in rice. This group expressed an Arabidopsis transcription factor known as Circadian Clock Associated1 (CCA1) under the Timing Of Cab Expression 1 (TOC1) promoter, which are both part of the circadian clock machinery in Arabidopsis. They found that overexpression of the CCA1 in rice had negative results, while repressing it caused positive changes to plant morphology. The researchers used RNAi, which is a biological process where small fragments of RNA are used by the cell to target complementary mRNA for destruction, thus silencing expression of the encoded protein. By comparing RNAi constructs based off of three different parts of the CCA1 gene for silencing the gene expression, they found that the RNAi derived from the 3\u2019-terminal end of the CCA1 gene had the best impact on plant morphology (13). This study is an important first step towards unlocking the power of using circadian clock genes to breed plants better adapted to a changing environment.</p>\n<p>One new strategy being considered is a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method that could be used to quickly develop improved crop varieties without transgenes. CRISPR/Cas9 can introduce specific changes into a plant genome without being limited by existing variation. Applying this method, scientists will be able to stack multiple edits into a plant within a single generation, resulting in transgene-free progeny. One benefit of this method is that it may allow for more complex changes to polygenetic traits or signaling pathways. For example, this could be helpful for targeting complex plant stress response pathways. This technology is currently limited by the availability of annotated reference genome sequences for plants other than Arabidopsis. Scheben et al. suggest that taking a genomics-based approach would allow for a comparison of species-wide genome diversity, making differences in copy-number visible and thus available for editing. While the authors suggest that this method creates plants that are indistinguishable from those created through natural breeding and random mutations, bans against genetically modified crops may target methodologies rather than the final result (14).</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p>Currently implemented genetically engineered crops, have been shown, through years of testing and trials to be at least as safe, both towards the environment and in terms of human health, as naturally bred varieties. While new transgenic lines must be screened and tested on a case-by-case basis, the overall benefits of this technology make it an important tool that may be necessary to confront upcoming challenges to agriculture. Climate change and population growth are putting steep demands on crops to survive in more hostile environments while also producing higher yields. Current efforts are focusing on vital crops, such as rice, corn, wheat, and fruits, to create drought-tolerant, heat-tolerant, and yield-optimized plants.</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cWorld Population Clock: 7.7 Billion People (2019) \u2013 Worldometers.\u201d n.d.

However, the general public has offered little attention towards the use of this engineering feat in a broader ecological system. Upon watching the new Netflix original </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Un</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">natural Selection</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, discussion of considering the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in New Zealand\u2019s effort to completely eradicate invasive species piqued my interest. The following article is an exploration of CRISPR/Cas9 prospect into New Zealand\u2019s bold environmental pursuit and its potential ecological impact.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since it has become feasible to cross oceans to reach unforeseeable land masses, invasive alien species (IAS) are an increasing threat to international biodiversity. Moreover, no other region faces as great of a peril as New Zealand (NZ), which holds the record as the nation </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">with the highest survival rate of threatened avifauna (birds of a particular region) species</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[5]. In 2012, New Zealand physicist Sir Paul Callaghan introduced a large-scale eradication program to permanently remove eight invasive mammalian predators (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rodents: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus rattus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus norvegicus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus exulans</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mus musculus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; mustelids: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela furo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela erminea</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela nivalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; and the common brushtail possum: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Trichosurus vulpecula</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) [5]. Four years after this grand proposal, the NZ government committed to a national challenge titled \u201cPredator Free 2050\u201d (PF 2050) to pursue this audacious goal.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Approximately 85 million years ago, NZ was one of the first landmasses to split from the supercontinent Gondwana and as it shifted away, it did not carry mammals until bats flew and aquatic species swam to this island. [7]. With the introduction of rodent species initially through Polynesian settlement some 750 years ago and thereafter European seafaring ventures, the endemic species of NZ have been left vulnerable to novel predators. Consequently, at least 51 native bird species that have evolved adaptive skills of remaining close to the ground have been unsuccessful at surviving alongside these rodent predator species [4]. These invasive omnivorous rodents prey on birds, eggs, seeds, snails, lizards, and fruits. As a result, their varied diets prompt competition with the native fauna, further placing pressure on their vulnerable survival [7]. Despite CRISPR/Cas9 modifications offering the greatest potential in gene drive to eliminate these unwanted predators, several techniques implemented to control these invasive populations,\u00a0 such as pesticides, trapping innovations, and biological factors have given favorable results.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Past Successes and Future Endeavors</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For decades, the NZ government has pursued eradication initiatives to permanently eliminate foreign invasive species on small local islands. Through concerted efforts, several of these projects have proven successful in the restoration of the natural biodiversity this island nation boasts.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In June of 2009, the NZ Department of Conservation (DOC) undertook a multi-action plan to simultaneously eradicate rodent, rabbit, stout, hedgehog, and cat species in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rangitoto and Motutapu islands. After three years of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">aerial dispersion of anticoagulant Pestoff 20R</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TM</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> combined with trapping and indicator dogs, the island witnessed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">total elimination of the islands\u2019 stoats and four rodent species; declination of rabbit and hedgehog population by 96%; and over 50% reduction in cats [7].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite these successful feats, the invasive species fecundity and ability to adapt to these challenges still present an overwhelming challenge to reach the goal of complete eradication. Recently, more direct approaches delving into novel genetic inheritance techniques have been explored to serve as a potential permanent solution. Termed the\u201cTrojan Female Technique\u201d (TFT), the method makes use of the correlation of sperm fitness dependence on the abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [2]. Healthy sperm is dependent on sufficient mitochondrial level for energy production to manage motility and fertilization. For example, experiments conducted on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drosophila melanogaster</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> supports the causation of reduced spermatogenesis and sperm maturation due to induced mutations in cytochrome mitochondrial gene [9]. Contrasting female eggs, the asymmetric greater dependence of sperm on mtDNA for normal functionality results in only male populations to be the sole source of target. Induction of mitochondrial mutations in females to compromise total sperm viability in future male progenies will serve as an effective control to population growth.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although seemingly promising, TFT is not guaranteed to completely eradicate propagation for several reasons. For starters, males with impaired fertility can still provide sufficient sperm count to fertilize eggs on a population-based scale. Furthermore, in circumstances where females do receive nonviable sperm count, they can still seek adequate functioning sperm through matings with other males. On a larger scale, should the mutation pervade, selection pressures could still inadvertently choose for nuclear modifications to make up for the mitochondrial defects [2]. These flaws raise the need for more pervasive and permanent resolutions.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Daisy Chain Crispr Gene Drive</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The recent biochemical breakthrough underpinning the ability to effectively and precisely modify genes with CRISPR/Cas9 has allowed for potential biotechnology to boom in the realm of ecology. The simple generation of a short RNA sequence into a virus or bacterium to serve as a vector, guides the cutting mechanism of Cas9 to specific regions in the genome to be excised, prompting for these double stranded breaks to be fixed through DNA repair mechanisms. While these fixtures can potentially repair the gene, it can also raise the possibility for the gene to be disabled, introduce a new function, or create an unforeseen mutation. Given the right specific targeting in the germ line, this approach houses the innovation for exterminating entire species through gene drive [6].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The mechanism behind gene drive overthrows the traditional Mendelian sexual reproduction concept of proportional contribution from both the male and female parent. The power comes from the ability of one genetically modified (GM) contributor encoding for the \u2018gene drive\u2019 to cut the other set of chromosomes lacking these genes and replace this excision with a self-replicating copy. In effect, this divisive modification would push for an otherwise heterozygous offspring from a wild-type mating with a GM partner to become homozygous for certain genes to be carried on and propagated by future generations. Given that these genetic alterations do not affect the fitness of the organism, dissemination of 1% of the population with CRISPR modified genes can lead to 99% of the local population carrying the genetic indicator in as little as nine generations (The use of gene editing to create gene drives for pest control in New Zealand).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Such a unilateral approach poses political and ethical challenges amongst neighboring nations with diverging ecological approaches to confront pest control. Should this pervasive gene drive program reach beyond its intended border, great difficulty would arise in maintaining this ecological enclosure. For example, possum is on the list of invasive species in NZ while just 2,500 miles west, its neighbor Australia keeps this species of marsupials under protection. As such, scientists have devised a simple model to localize gene alterations, coined The Daisy Chain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike the original gene drive method in which all components necessary for transformation (CRISPR, edited DNA, and guide RNAs) are provided on the same chromosome, Daisy Chain provides a self-exhaustive means of guaranteeing genetic edits. This tool is designed so that\u00a0 each component required for genetic alteration is dependent on the presence of a different element upstream on the gene found on the same locus to be activated [8]. The most downstream portion of this chain contains the \u201cload\u201d of engineered dominant lethal genes preventing reproduction, which will be promoted to higher frequency in the population within several generations. For instance, should an engineered allele contain three elements A, B, and C, element C would render element B to drive, which will in turn cause element A carrying the final load to drive. The initial element (C in this case) does not actually drive, thus is restricted by the number of altered individuals released into the wild and will be lost via natural selection over time. During initial implementation, the presence of C will increase B in abundance, but B will eventually decline and finally disappear as C is lost in the population. The rapid rise in abundance of B will also cause A to increase in frequency within the local population; however, with the decrease of B, A would not be driven and will ultimately vanish as well [1]. Using MIT Professor Esvelt\u2019s analogy, \u201c\u2026 the elements of a daisy drive system are similar to booster stages of a genetic rocket: those at the bottom of the base of the daisy-chain help life the payload until they run out of fuel and are successively lost.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><h4>Challenges with Daisy Chain Crispr Gene Drive</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CRISPR/Cas9 technology\u2019s ability to potentially alter these invasive species\u2019 fecundity provides an avenue of pursuing NZ\u2019s goal of PF 2050. Despite the developed understanding of how to carry out this plan, scientists in NZ are still working to piece together the genomes of stoats and possums in order to understand where to properly facilitate the engineered RNA sequence. Other barriers that must be acknowledged are the unprecedented approach to genetically modify marsupials and the difficulty of implanting hundreds to thousands of oocytes to be dispersed amongst their population.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond these known difficulties, scientists still tread in unknown terrains pertaining to whether these mutations can have pernicious effects in the survival, health, and reproductive success in propagating these mutations within their populations. Further exploration into the development of these modifications, and the potential impacts they can have on these animals, must be investigated on model organisms prior to widespread use.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of the eight listed mammalian species vied to be permanently eradicated from NZ, Mus musculus holds the most promise, given the extensive knowledge of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mus musculus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> genome. With the help of scientists outside of New Zealand, joining in on the efforts to identify which germline gene to focus on, this project has received international attention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although the daisy drive provides promising potential, research collaborators at MIT and Harvard have identified a possible risk of, \u201c\u2026 DNA encoding a drive component from one element to another, thereby creating a \u2018daisy necklace\u2019 capable of a global drive\u201d [1]. Due to this rare recombinatory event arising from the similarity of DNA sequences, these investigators have looked into circumventing the problem by creating numerous alternatives to CRISPR components and selecting the model with the greatest diversity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From their renowned aviary to reptilian species, New Zealand\u2019s islandic geographical region houses some of the most biodiverse fauna known to man. The arrival of human settlement has introduced predatory species, causing endemic species to experience extinction at concerning rates [4]. With the purpose of preserving their unique remaining diversity, New Zealand has committed to concerted efforts of varying methods to eradicate these invasive vertebrate pests. Investigation into genetic modifications can provide for more expansive and thorough techniques to eliminate these human introduced pests and allow for these endangered species to thrive once again. By further exploring daisy chain CRISPR/Cas9, this effort can be genetically inherited by offspring, allowing for nature to carry out this effort. As opposed to continued efforts of targeting each individual one by one, conservation ecologists can borrow from molecular biologist\u2019s toolkit to revolutionize the means of pursuing pest control and perhaps even pave the road for future endeavors with similar pursuits.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Esvelt, Kevin M. \u201cDaisy Drives.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sculpting Evolution</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, www.sculptingevolution.org/daisydrives.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gemmell, Neil J., et al. \u201cThe Trojan Female Technique: a Novel, Effective and Humane Approach for Pest Population Control.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 280, no. 1773, 2013, pp. 1\u20136., doi:10.1098/rspb.2013.2549.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Griffiths, Richard, et al. \u201cSuccessful Eradication of Invasive Vertebrates on Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands, New Zealand.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Biological Invasions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 17, no. 5, 2014, pp. 1355\u20131369., doi:10.1007/s10530-014-0798-7.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Owens, Brian. \u201cThe Big Cull: Can New Zealand Pull off an Audacious Plan to Get Rid of Invasive Predators by 2050?\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nature</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 541, 12 Jan. 2017, pp. 148\u2013150.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Russell, James C., John G.

        "title": "Where the Bison Roam and the Dung Beetles Roll: How American Bison, Dung Beetles, and Prescribed Fires are Bringing Grasslands Back",
        "author": "John Liu, Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology \u201821",
        "date": "06/26/2020",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this article, I will explore the overwhelming impact that the teeny tiny dung beetles have on American grasslands. Dung beetles, along with reintroduced bison and prescribed fires, are stomping, rolling, and burning through the landscape; all in efforts to revive destroyed grassland habitats. Barber et. al. looks at how the beetles are reacting to the bison herds and prescribed fires. Seemingly unrelated factors interact with each other closely, producing results that bring hope to one of the most threatened habitats.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Watching grass grow its lit</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grasslands are quiet from afar, often characterized by windblown tallgrasses and peaking prairie dogs. But in fact, they are dynamic. Historically, grasslands were constantly changing: fires ripping through the landscape, bison stampedes kicking up dust, and grasses changing colors by the season [2]. However, climate change, increasing human populations, and agricultural conversions all contribute to an increasing loss of critical habitats; grasslands being amongst the most affected [7]. A loss of grasslands not only results in the extermination of previously residing fauna, but also a reduction of ecosystem services that they once provided. Thus, it is of increasing concern to restore grassland habitats. With the help of bison, dung beetles, and prescribed fires, recovery of grasslands is promising and likely swift.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Eat, poop, burn, repeat</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As previously mentioned, grasslands thrive when continuously disturbed. The constant disturbance keeps woody vegetation from encroaching, nonnative plants from invading, and biodiversity from declining as a result of competitive exclusion between species [12]. To accomplish this, grasslands rely on large herbivore grazers such as American bison (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bison bison</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) to rip through the vegetation and fires to clear large areas of dry debris [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">American bison are herbivore grazers- animals that feed on plant matter near the ground. The presence of these grazers alter available plant biomass, vegetation community structures, and soil conditions. This is the result of constant trampling, consuming, and digesting of the plant matter [9, 11]. Due to their valuable impact on the landscape, bison are considered keystone species- species that have an overwhelming, essential role in the success of an ecosystem [8]. Grasslands would look vastly different without bison walking, eating, and defecating on them [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But bison do not aimlessly roam the grasslands, eating anything they come across. They specifically target areas that have been recently burned. These scorched areas present themselves with new growth, higher in nutritional content [3, 5]. Historically, lightning strikes or intense summer heats caused these fires, driving the movement of grazers, but human intervention inhibits these natural occurrences. Instead, prescribed fires- planned, controlled burnings performed by humans- now mitigate the loss of natural fires, encouraging the bison\u2019s selective foraging behaviors [4, 12]. Inciting bison to follow burned patches benefits the grasslands in more ways than one. First, this prevents overgrazing of any one particular area. By moving throughout the landscape, particular areas will reestablish while others are cleared by the bison. Second, the simple act of traversing large distances physically changes the landscape. Bison are large animals that travel in herds. When moving about the grasslands, they trample vegetation and compact the soil beneath their hoofs. Finally, grazing bison interrupt the process of competitive exclusion- limiting success as a result of competition for resources- amongst native plants. They indiscriminately consume vegetation in these areas, leaving little room for any one species of plant to out compete another [9].</span></p>\n<p><h4>The world is your toilet\u2026. with dung beetles!</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What goes in must come out, and bison are no exception to that rule. After digestion of the grasses they eat, bison leave behind a trail of dung and urine. The nitrogen rich waste feeds back into the ecosystem, offering valuable nutrients to the plants and soil-dwelling organisms alike [1]. But a recent study by Barber et. al. highlights a small, but critical component that ensures nutrient distribution is maximized in grasslands: the dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae, and Geotrupidae).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dung beetles rely on the solid waste from their mammalian partners. The beetles eat, distribute, and even bury the dung; which helps with carbon sequestration [10]. They are found around the world- from the rainforests of Borneo to the grasslands of North America- and interact with each environment differently. In Borneo, dung beetles distribute seeds found in the waste of fruit loving Howler monkeys (Alouatta spps) [6]. While in North America, they spread nutrients found in the waste of grazing bison. They provide unique ecosystem functions- shattering of nutrient rich dung throughout vast landscapes. These attributes led to their increasing popularity in science research as a study taxon in recent years.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Figure 1</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grassland health is largely dependent on the interplay of multiple living and non-living elements. In 1.1, the area is dominated by woody vegetation and few grasses due to a lack of disturbance. In 1.2, the introduction of prescribed fires clears some woody vegetation, allowing grasses to compete. In 1.3, bison introduce nutrients into the landscape, increasing productivity. However, the distribution of dung is limited. In 1.4, the addition of dung beetles lead to better distribution of nutrients thus more productivity and species diversity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Barber et. al. took a closer look to see how exactly dung beetles were reacting to bison grazing and prescribed fires blazing through their grassy fields. They found significant contributions from each; both noticeably directing the movement and influencing the abundance of these beetles. As the bison followed the flames, so did the beetles. The beetles\u2019 dependence on the bison\u2019s dung showed when researchers looked at beetle abundance in two key areas: those with bison and those without. There were significantly more beetles in areas with bison, likely feeding on their dung, scattering it, and burying it; all while simultaneously feeding the landscape. Prescribed fires also lead to increases in beetle abundance. Whether it be 1.5 years post-restoration or 30 years post-restoration, researchers consistently saw increases in beetle abundance when prescribed fires were performed. This further amplifies the importance of disturbances in grassland habitats, for ecosystem health but also for species richness.</span></p>\n<p><h4>And the grass keeps growing</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The reintroduction of bison in the grasslands of America proved successful in rebuilding a lost habitat, with the help of dung beetles and prescribed fires. However, bison and dung beetles are just one of many examples of unlikely pairings rebuilding lost habitats. Although the large-scale ecological processes have been widely studied, species-to-species interactions are often overlooked. Continued surveys of the grasslands will reveal more about the interactions of contributing factors and their effects on each other and the habitat around them.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Citations</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Barber, Nicholas A., et al. \u201cInitial Responses of Dung Beetle Communities to Bison Reintroduction in Restored and Remnant Tallgrass Prairie.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Natural Areas Journal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 39, no. 4, 2019, p. 420., doi:10.3375/043.039.0405.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collins, Scott L., and Linda L.

A year ago, in my EVE 101 class, my professor briefly mentioned the idea that algae could be used to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in an attempt to slow the rate of climate change. I found this theory very interesting, and it resonated with me longer than most of the other subject matter in that class. I really enjoyed doing the research for this paper, and I hope it gives people some hope for the future. I\u2019d like to thank my UWP professor, Kathie Gossett, for pointing me in the right direction throughout the process of writing this paper.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With climate change growing ever more relevant in our daily lives, scientists are working hard to find solutions to slow and reverse the damage that humans are doing to the planet. Algae-based carbon sequestration methods are a viable solution to this problem. Photosynthesis allows algae to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turn it into biomass and oxygen. It has even been proposed that raw algal biomass can be harvested and used as a biofuel, which can provide a greener alternative to fossil fuel usage. Though technology is not yet developed enough to make this change in our primary fuel source, incremental progress can be taken to slowly integrate algal biofuel into daily life. Further research and innovation on the subject could allow full-scale replacement of fossil fuels with algal biofuel to be a feasible option. Methods of algal cultivation include open-ocean algal blooms, photo bioreactors, algal turf scrubbing, and\u00a0BICCAPS\u00a0(bicarbonate-based\u00a0integrated carbon capture and algae production system). There are many pros and cons to each method, but open-ocean algal blooms tend to be the most popular because they are the most economical and produce the most algae, even though they are the most harmful to the environment.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Keywords</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Algae | Biofuel | Climate Change | Carbon Sequestration</span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As we get further into the 21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">st</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> century, climate change becomes less of a theory and more of a reality. Astronomically high post-Industrial Revolution rates of greenhouse gas emissions have started to catch up with humans, as the initial consequences of these actions are now coming to light with fear that worse is on the way. Many solutions have been proposed to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, but very few involve fixing the damage that has already been done. It has been proposed that growing algae in large quantities could help solve this climate crisis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 76% of greenhouse gas emissions come in the form of carbon dioxide. As algae grows, it removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by converting it to biomass and oxygen via photosynthesis. Algae convert carbon dioxide to biomass at relatively fast rates. On average, one kilogram of algae utilizes 1.87 kilograms of CO</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> daily,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">which means that one acre of algae utilizes approximately 2.7 tons of CO</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> per day [1]. For comparison, one acre of a 25-year-old maple beech-birch forest only utilizes 2.18 kilograms of CO</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> per day [2]. This amount of carbon dioxide sequestration can be done by only 1.17 kilograms of algae. After its photosynthetic purpose has come to an end, the raw algal biomass can be harvested and used as an environmentally-friendly biofuel. This literary review will serve as a comprehensive overview of the literature on this proposal to use algae as a primary combatant against global warming.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Carbon Dioxide</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For centuries, heavy usage of fossil fuels has tarnished Earth\u2019s atmosphere with the addition of greenhouse gases [3]. These gases trap heat by absorbing infrared radiation that would otherwise leave Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This increases the overall temperature of the earth, which leads to the melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and strengthening of tropical storm systems, among many other devastating environmental effects [4]. The most commonly emitted greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, tends to be the primary focus of global warming treatments.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These algal treatment methods are no different. Any algal treatment option is dependent upon the fact that algae sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. It converts carbon dioxide into biomass and releases oxygen into the atmosphere as a product of the photosynthetic process [5].</span></p>\n<p><h4>Algal Cultivation</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are four proposed methods of algal cultivation: open-ocean algal blooms, photobioreactors, algal turf scrubbing, and BICCAPS. These techniques all differ greatly, with various benefits and drawbacks to each.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Open-Ocean Algal Blooms</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Algae is most abundant on the surface of the open ocean. With the addition of its limiting nutrient, iron, in the form of iron(ii) sulfate (FeSO</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">), massive algal blooms can be easily sparked anywhere in the ocean [3]. This seems to be the way that most scientists envision sequestration because, of all proposed cultivation techniques, this one produces the most algae in the least amount of time. Intuitively, this method removes the most carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as the amount of CO</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> removed is directly proportional to the quantity of algae undergoing photosynthesis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many benefits to open-ocean algal blooms. There is no shortage of space on the surface of the ocean, so, hypothetically, there is a seemingly infinite amount of algal mass that can be cultivated this way. This technique is also very cost-efficient, as all you need to employ it is some iron(ii) sulfate and nature will do the rest [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once the algal bloom has grown to its maximum size, there is an overabundance of algal biomass on the surface of the ocean. Some researchers have proposed that this mass be collected and used as a biofuel [5,6,7]. Others have proposed that we let nature play its course and allow the dead algae to sink to the bottom of the ocean. This ensures that the carbon dioxide it has taken out of the atmosphere is stored safely at the bottom of the ocean [8]. Here, the algal biomass is easily accessible for consumption by shellfish, who store the carbon in their calcium carbonate shells [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This solution is not an easy one to deploy, however, because algal blooms bring many problems to the local ecosystems. Often referred to as harmful algal blooms (HABs), these rapidly growing algae clusters are devastating to the oceanic communities they touch. They increase acidity, lower temperature, and severely deplete oxygen levels in waters they grow in [9]. Most lifeforms aren\u2019t prepared to handle environmental changes that push them out of their niches, so it\u2019s easy to see why HABs kill significant portions of marine life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">HABs can affect humans as well. Many species of alga are toxic to us, and ingestion of contaminated fish or water from areas affected by these blooms can lead to extreme sickness and even death. Some examples of these diseases are ciguatera fish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning, and diarrheic shellfish poisoning [10]. The effects of harmful algal blooms have only been studied in the short-term, but from what we have seen, they are definitely a barrier in using this form of algae cultivation [11].</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Photobioreactors</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Photobioreactors are another frequently-proposed tool for cultivating algae. These artificial growth chambers have controlled temperature, pH, and nutrient levels that make for optimal growth rates of algae [12]. They can also run off of wastewater that is not suitable for human consumption. Photobioreactors minimize evaporation and, with the addition of iron, magnesium, and vitamins, increase rates of carbon dioxide capture are increased [1]. Due to the high concentration of algae in a relatively small space, photobioreactors have the highest rates of photosynthesis (and subsequently carbon dioxide intake) out of all of the cultivation methods mentioned in this paper.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This innovative technology was driven primarily by the need to come up with an alternative to triggering open-ocean algal blooms. Photobioreactors eliminate pollution and water contamination risks that are prevalent in harmful algal blooms. Furthermore, they make raw algal biomass easily accessible for collection and use as a biofuel, which open-ocean algal blooms do not [12].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The main drawback to this method is that the cost of building and maintaining photobioreactors is simply too high to be economically feasible right now [12]. Technological developments need to be made to lower the short-term cost of operation and allow for mass production if we want to use them as a primary source of carbon sequestration. Their long-term economic feasibility still remains unknown, as most of the cost is endured during the production of the photobioreactors. Money is made back through the algae cultivated, but the technology hasn\u2019t been around long enough to show concrete long-term cost-benefit analyses without speculation [14].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Algal Turf Scrubbing (ATS)</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proposed in 2018 by botanist Walter Adey, algal turf scrubbing (ATS) is a new technique created to efficiently cultivate algae for use in the agriculture and biofuel industries. The process involves using miniature wave generators to slightly disturb the flat surface of a floway and stimulate the growth of numerous algal species in the water. Biodiversity in these floways increases over time, and a typical ATS floway will eventually have over 100 different algae species [11].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heavy metals and other toxic pollutants occasionally make their way into the floways; however, they are promptly removed, to ensure that the product is as nontoxic as possible. The algal biomass is harvested bi-weekly and has a variety of uses. Less toxic harvests can be used as fertilizers in the agricultural industry, which research claims is the most economically efficient use for the harvest. It can also go towards biofuel use, although the creators of the ATS system believe the majority of their product will go towards agricultural use because they will not be able to produce enough algae to keep up with the demand (if our society moves towards using it as a biofuel) [11].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The problems with ATS are not technological, but sociopolitical, as the research team behind it fears that they will not get the funding and resources needed to perform their cultivation at an effective level [11].</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BICCAPS</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The bicarbonate-based integrated carbon capture and algae production system (BICCAPS) was proposed to reduce the high costs of commercial algal biomass production by recycling bicarbonate that is created when algae capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and using it to culture alkalihalophilic microalgae (algae that thrive in a very basic pH above 8.5). Through this ability to culture more algae, the system should, in theory, cut costs of carbon capture and microalgal culture. It is also very sustainable, as it recycles nutrients and minimizes water usage. The algae cultivated can also be turned into biofuel to lower fossil fuel usage [13].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The main drawback to this closed-loop system is that it does not cultivate as much algae as the other systems, though work is currently being done to improve this. It has been proven that the efficiency of BICCAPS significantly improves with the addition of sodium to the water, which stimulates the growth of alkalihalophilic microalgae [13]. This means that, with a little bit of improvement to the efficiency of the system, BICCAPS could become a primary algal biomass production strategy because of its low cost and sustainability.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Use of Algae as a Biofuel</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While algae may not have the energetic efficiency of fossil fuels, it is not far behind. It can be burned as a biofuel to power transportation, which would allow us to lower our use of fossil fuels and, subsequently, our greenhouse gas emissions. When dry algal biomass is burned, it releases more oxygen and less carbon dioxide than our current fuel sources. The increase in oxygen released into the atmosphere not only helps to lower CO2 emissions but increases the overall atmospheric ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide. More research still has to be done to find the best possible blend of algal species for fuel consumption [12]. Solely using algae as a biofuel would not meet the world\u2019s energy demand, but the technology for photobioreactors continues to improve, giving hope to one day use algae more than fossil fuels [6].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A common counterargument to proposals for algal biofuel usage is that burning dry algae only provides half the caloric value of a similarly-sized piece of coal. While this is true, it should be taken into consideration that that coal has an extraordinarily high caloric value and that the caloric value of algae is still considered high relative to alternative options [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is often suggested that bioethanol, which essentially uses crops as fuel, should be used over algal biofuel. The main problem with this proposal is that farmers would spend more time cultivating inedible crops because they make for better fuel. This would lead to food shortages on top of the current hunger problem in our world. Farming crops also take up land, while growing algae does not [7].</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drawbacks</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The main problems associated with using algae as a biofuel are technological and economical. We simply do not have the technology in place right now to produce enough algae to completely replace fossil fuels with it. In order to do this, we would have to establish full-scale production plants, which is not as economically viable as simply continuing to use the fossil fuels that degrade our planet [12]. Receiving funding for the commercialization of algae is the biggest obstacle this plan faces. It\u2019s difficult to get money allocated to environmental conservation efforts because, unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t rank very highly in our government\u2019s priorities. Algal carbon sequestration has also never been observed at a commercial scale, so there is hesitation to fully commit resources to something that seems like a gamble.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alternative Uses</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It has also been proposed that algal biomass grown to sequester carbon dioxide should be used in the agricultural industry. As previously mentioned, the creators of ATS have suggested using it as a fertilizer [11]. Others say that it can be used to feed livestock or humans, as some cultures actually consume algae already [12]. The seemingly infinite supply of microbes can also be harvested and used heavily in the medical industry in the form of antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant treatments [7].</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Algae can be used to fight climate change because it removes carbon dioxide from our atmosphere, stores it as biomass, and replaces it with oxygen. Arguments have been made in many directions over the best method of algal cultivation. Triggering open-ocean algal blooms is certainly the most cost-efficient of these methods, and it produces the most algal biomass. The problem with using this technique is that these algal blooms have devastating ecological effects on the biological communities they come in contact with. Photobioreactors are another popular method among those who favor this strategy because of their ability to efficiently produce large quantities of algae; however, the main inhibition to their usage is the extremely high cost of construction and operation. With more focus on developing lower cost photobioreactors, they can potentially become the primary source of algal growth. Algal turf scrubbing is another strategy of algae cultivation that struggles with the problem of acquiring adequate funding for the operation. BICCAPS is a relatively inexpensive and eco-friendly way to grow algae in a closed system, but it yields low quantities of algal biomass compared to the other systems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The raw algal biomass from these growth methods can potentially be used as a biofuel. Dry alga has a high caloric value, which makes it great for burning to power equipment. It does not burn as well as fossil fuels, but it does release more oxygen and less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels when burned. Of course, funding will be needed for increased algae production to make this a possibility, but with more research and advances in the field, algal growth would be a great way to remove large amounts of carbon dioxide that is stuck in Earth\u2019s atmosphere and become our primary fuel source down the line.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anguselvi V, Masto R, Mukherjee A, Singh P.

However, most often we neglect an important part of the ecosystem \u2014 Fungi. Without us noticing, the fungi stealthily connects the organisms underground, creating a communication network that helps organisms interact with one another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Picture yourself walking your dog in a quiet, peaceful natural forest, where you imagine the two of you as the only organisms capable of interacting with one another here. However, you are not alone; the plants can communicate and those trees and grasses are always speaking to each other without you taking notice. The conversation between vascular plants in this forest started before any of us are old enough to remember, and will likely continue if this forest is untouched. These conversations between seemingly disconnected organisms have helped this forest survive and thrive to become what you see today. You might wonder, what do these plants talk about, and most importantly, how do the plants communicate if they cannot move freely and have no vocal cords? The secret lies underground in an extensive network.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The underground network connects different immobile creatures to one another. Much like the above-ground biological interactions, the underground ecosystem is diverse, and not only houses many animals, but also consists of roots of different plants, bacteria, and fungal mycelium. The plant roots interact with their immediate neighbors, but in order for plants to communicate with plants further away from them, they rely on the underground fungal network, or according to Dr. Suzanne Simard</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">who popularized the idea, the \u201cWood Wide Web\u201d (WWW).</span></p>\n<p><h4>What is the underground \u201cWood Wide Web\u201d, and how is it built?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This communication network is not made up of invisible radio waves like our Wifi, but rather relies on a minuscule and dense fungi network to deliver various signals and information [6]. These fungi, using their branching and arm-like membranes, build a communication network called the mycelium that connects between individual plants, and even the whole ecosystem. The mycelium deliver nutrients, sugar, and water, and in a more complex dynamic with the plants, deliver chemical signals. The fungi\u2019s ability to expand their mycelium through reproduction and growth of fungi individually helps build these connections within the network. To expand their mycelium and link the network together with different individual plants, it must be evolutionarily advantageous for the fungi species to create such an extensive system. That is where the plant roots and their cooperative interactions come into play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This communication network builds upon the foundation of mutualistic relationships between plants and fungi called mycorrhizae. Mutualism is the relationship that allows plants to provide sugars for the fungi in exchange for limiting nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and sometimes water (figure 1). According to an article published by Fleming, around 80-90% of the earth\u2019s vascular plants have this mutualistic relationship, which allows plants and fungi to connect with one another through the plant roots. Without the mutually beneficial relationship, the fungi are not obligated to expand their network to connect to the plant roots and \u201chelp\u201d these plants deliver chemical signals.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not only is there nutrient and informational exchange, but the plants benefit from fungi priming, where the initial fungi infection that creates the exchange interface between plant roots and fungi cells force the plant immune systems to increase immunity. The increased immunity in the infected plant indirectly\u00a0increases the chances of the plants in resisting major changes such as a disease in the ecosystem</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[6]. This continuous plant-fungi network through nutrient exchange and strengthening each species\u2019 survival connects the whole ecosystem together.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1: A simplified visual of species interactions within the fungal network.\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Source: BBC)</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That being said, the plant and fungal species that make up the WWW can vary by the participants who built the ecosystems.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The interaction also means that the plants can selectively provide carbon or release defense chemicals to decide which fungus remains and has a mutualistic relationship with them</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [1]. When introducing a non-native species, it can alter the new ecosystem by encouraging different types of mycorrhiza. One such example was the introduction of European cheatgrass in Utah, U.S.A. The mycorrhizal makeup in Utah initially does not have significant changes prior to the introduction. However, upon European cheatgrass introduction to the Utahn site, despite the cheatgrass that does not contain European fungi, the site showed a shifted fungi genetic makeup [8]. Each plant individual, or species, using their preferences and abilities to \u201cchoose\u201d their mutualistic partners, can diversify the fungal network to become more extensive and powerful, both to benefit and to harm other species of the ecosystem. The interspecies perspective is important in understanding the WWW.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Plants talk and interact through the \u201cWood Wide Web\u201d</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The communication extends to others in the ecosystem \u2014 the plants can \u201cspeak\u201d to each other interspecifically, too. The individuals in an ecosystem are closely linked to one another, and so are relationships between plant individuals, whether it is directly with each other, indirectly through the fungal network, or both. The indirect communication relies on the fungal network, where various chemical signals pass through. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For instance, the increased phosphorus level in the soil signals other plants that there is a plant-fungal interaction, and they may respond to this signal in different ways to ensure the situation is to their advantage \u2014 they could try to have their share of nutrients by producing sugars to attract these types of fungi, or they could make their plant competitors less healthy by excreting chemicals to weaken the fungus\u2019 abilities to provide nutrients</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [13]. The WWW provides an internet that allows the plants to select a variety of methods to interact with one another, near or far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The plants can choose to actively help each other through this fungal network, and allow both individuals, or species, to thrive in the ecosystem. Evolutionarily speaking, a plant individual could benefit from their own kind to thrive for the benefit of their survival. When an individual plant is thriving and producing excess carbon, they can help other plants by transferring excess nutrients through the fungal network [6]. An older, dying tree can also choose to transfer its resources to the younger neighbors through the fungal network, or donate its stored nutrients to the entire ecosystem through the decaying process that is aided by the extensive fungal network from fungal hyphae growth over the material [5]. Furthermore, through the WWW, the plants are able to communicate with one another about the possible threats including herbivores and parasitic fungi. In the research of Song et al, tomato plants infected with pathogens are able to send various defensive chemical signals, such as enzymes, into the existing fungal network for healthy neighbors in the network, warning them of the dangers nearby before they are infected themselves; using this mechanism, the plants can concentrate defensive chemicals with neighbors to minimize the spreading of this parasitic fungus in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not only can plants benefit one another, they can also use this network to put others at a disadvantage, such as to wipe out another competing or predating species that threaten their own survival. Allelopathy, or the exuding of chemicals to ward off enemies, usually gives off the impression that the plants use this method to discourage herbivores from consuming them, such as the milky sap that causes skin rashes and inflammation when a cucumber vine is cut, but the allelopathy is also active underground through the WWW. Barto et al, through their research on allelopathy, shows that even within a disturbed habitat, when there is competition between plant species, one species may utilize the regional network of fungi attached to them to deliver allelochemicals from one plant species to its neighboring species, preserving the fitness of their own kind.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Passive Animals, Active Plant and Fungi</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We always think of herbivores as active players impacting the ecosystem. In the WWW, they are the last to respond to changes. Plants and fungi signal each other when an herbivore is present in the network, well before it has established its presence in the neighboring plants. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fungi are an important and active part of this ecosystem because they can also choose to exclude herbivores through chemical allelopathy</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. While it is possible that the fungi can choose to colonize a separate species that provides more benefits for them, they can concentrate their energy on defending its current host. Before the herbivore can expand its population, the plants have already communicated with one another through excretion of allelopathic chemicals, not only to ward off the herbivores that are causing potential damage, but also to warn other plants of the herbivore presence</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[1]. The fungi colonization of two nightshade species, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Solanum ptycanthum</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Solanum dulcamara</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">showed</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> an increase of defense protein levels against the feeding caterpillars. This is just one example of herbivory defense mechanisms that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">results in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">decreased predator fitness, specifically in reduced growth rate and feeding rates [11]. When caterpillars feed on the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Solanum</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> spp., the active players in this relationship, the fungi and their plant hosts use chemical defense mechanisms indirectly induced by the fungi to discourage herbivores from feeding, and through evolution, eventually they drive out predators who are disadvantageous to the fungi-plant fitness.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Alone without the Wood Wide Web Human Impacts</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The network is built on a web of hyphae connections that is barely visible to the human eye, and even more vulnerable to changes. Older ecosystems not only have a higher percentage of larger trees with broader root systems, but are also denser in number, which both lead to a more extensive mycorrhizal fungal network. The species diversity, on top of age and density, contributes to a complex and healthy WWW that supports all plants in the ecosystem [3]. However, a disturbed ecosystem severs the connections in this network, making the previously extensive system difficult to repair.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Human activities that disturb the soil can affect this fragile yet powerful connection: seasonal tilling in agriculture, intensive logging, and change of soil chemistry and structure by laying concrete inhibits the soil from building an extensive web. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Physically turning and chemically altering the soil is a direct human impact that cuts off hyphae connections between plant individuals in the system.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> According to Dr. Simard\u2019s statement in a Biohabitat interview, the urban plants are less healthy because they lack the WWW to help them thrive through nutrient, water, and chemical signal exchange; they must do all those things or rely on humans to provide these needs. Indirectly, the larger-scale deaths and removal of plant individuals from logging also no longer foster a healthy mutualistic relationship between plants and fungi. If an individual plant is prevented from connecting with its mutualistic partners, whether that is through disturbance in the soil or the death of these partners, prevent the extensiveness of the WWW, and the isolation makes the urban tree population vulnerable to diseases if the humans do not diligently maintain them.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is true that the smaller versions of the WWW still develop between periods of disturbance, proven indirectly by the fungal colonization ability in off-site lab experiments such as those included in the studies of Barto et al and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hawkes et al. However, important interspecies collaborations and perhaps lack thereof that is missing compared to a minimally disturbed habitat functions much better in resisting climate change and increased foreign and invasive species that threaten the health of the ecosystem.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fortunately, despite the growing demand of land produced by economic growth and population, there is an increased awareness of the importance of plants and the health of the ecosystem. Over the last two decades, the addition of policies and practices indicated that major western conservation agencies have started to take on an interspecies perspective. One notable example is the inclusion of ecosystem management in the Clean Water Act, which adapts to the notion that endangered flora or fauna species is dependent on the health of an ecosystem [14]. The increased understanding of how interconnected the flora species are, in addition to conservation methods that have existed before the western colonization, have changed how governments aim to preserve nature.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regardless of the level of human impacts, the WWW holds important communication between plants, fungi, and herbivores through chemical signals and nutrient exchange to sustain or to outcompete each other. The connectivity to relay information within this network is key to the healthy plant community, and further the health of the ecosystem. Next time when you walk your dog in the woods, remember that the plants around you are capable of communicating thanks to this underground network. In order to keep this forest healthy for generations on, it is up to us to rethink development strategies to preserve this network that helps them thrive to continue the species\u2019 communication in the WWW in this forest.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Biere, Arjen, Hamida B.

Hillary urged me to take my writing beyond her course. In May, I had the wonderful opportunity to share this research at the 2020 UC Davis Annual Undergraduate Research Conference. I want to continue to share my work through publication. I wrote this piece with the intention of inspiring both students and teachers. From this paper, students can learn the parable of the passenger pigeon and teachers can come to understand why teaching about the passenger pigeon matters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I learned of the passenger pigeon during my first week of college at UC Davis. One of my professors, Dr. Kelt, explained a brief history of the passenger pigeon to my first-year wildlife ecology and conservation class. The lesson was about wildlife-human interactions and the destruction humans can execute on the environment. The passenger pigeon\u2019s story shook me to my core. It was a disturbing portrayal of how people sometimes negatively shape ecosystems. For me, it reinforced all of the reasons I decided to study wildlife conservation. I want people who read this piece to feel the emotions I felt when I first took in the parable of the passenger pigeon and come to the belief that humans have a responsibility to conserve species through management, policy, and education. The more people who hear this parable, the more people who hold sympathy for our wildlife. It should be built into schools\u2019 science and history curriculums. A greater understanding of the passenger pigeon will save future species from extinction.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genre is the literary process through which people collectively communicate about a topic. Applied to a species, genre helps us understand how society communicates about that animal. Species\u2019 genres change over time as different people interact with them. This influences human-wildlife interactions and thus plays a critical role in determining the fate of that species.\u00a0 In the passenger pigeon\u2019s (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ectopistes migratorius</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) prime, it was the most abundant bird species in existence but went extinct. The dynamics of human-wildlife interactions over time defined the progression of the passenger pigeon\u2019s recorded history. These interactions varied based on how the dominant people in North America thought about the bird and the genre surrounding its existence. The parable of the passenger pigeon is a poignant example of why genre matters in preserving species and how this can go wrong. The analysis of the historical evolution of the passenger pigeon\u2019s genre showed that the European colonization of North America is why these birds went extinct. I conducted a survey that showed that the passenger pigeon\u2019s genre is fading among young people. Failing to spread the parable of the passenger pigeon is a threat to every currently endangered species and their respective genres.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The passenger pigeon (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ectopistes migratorius</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) lived in North America and was described as having a \u201csmall head and neck, long tail, and beautiful plumage\u201d [1]. In its prime, it had the largest population size of any bird species at the time but went extinct due to overexploitation and habitat loss caused by European settlers [1]. The dynamics of human-wildlife interactions over time defined the progression of the passenger pigeon\u2019s recorded history.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These interactions varied based on how the dominant people in North America thought about the bird and the genre surrounding its existence. Genre refers to \u201crepeating rhetorical situations\u201d to aid human interaction. In other words, it is the collection of how people refer to a specific topic. The definition of genre can be applied broadly. Genres are dynamic and develop over time, as people face new situations to apply them to. Every species has its own genre surrounding its existence. People participate in many genres on a daily basis, even if they do not know it. Genre is a \u201csocial action,\u201d people shape genres and genres shape people [2].\u00a0 The way groups of people collectively feel about anything is communicated through language. Thus, looking at the way people talked about passenger pigeons explains the processes that led to their downfall. The passenger pigeon is an effective ambassador for teaching youth about conservation because of the population\u2019 rapid decline.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Historical Evolution</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indigenous People\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The passenger pigeon\u2019s parable begins with Indigenous people who lived within the range of the bird, mostly covering only the Eastern half of America [1]. These Indigenous people were the first humans to interact with the passenger pigeon and create its genre.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Simon Pokagon, a Potawatomi tribe member was interviewed about seeing them in flight: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhen a young man I have stood for hours admiring the movements of these birds. I have seen them fly in unbroken lines from the horizon\u2026\u201d [3]. Under </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indigenous peoples\u2019 care, the passenger pigeon numbers rose beginning in the years 100 to 900 C.E. [4]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This was because Indigenous people and passenger pigeons had a well-balanced relationship that allowed both populations to thrive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indigenous people</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> carefully interacted with the passenger pigeon because it was an important game bird to them, second only to the wild turkey [1]. The passenger pigeon was a staple food of the Seneca, who named the bird </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">jah\u2019gowa</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, meaning \u201cbig bread\u201d [4]. Tribes followed specific procedures for hunting the birds. Almost all tribes had a strict policy</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">based in both religion and biology</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">against taking nesting adult passenger pigeons. This strategic wildlife management policy promoted chick survival by allowing parents to care for their young. The Sioux and the Iroquois League were among those known to enforce their rules on other hunters. Instead of hunting the birds during this time, they often used nests as an opportunity to closely observe the bird. Individual tribes also had additional policies. For the Ho Chunks, hunting of the passenger pigeon could only happen if the chief held a feast. When the birds returned in spring, they offered much needed seasonal food. Before the Seneca began the hunt, they monitored the nests until the chicks were two to three weeks old. The Seneca even went as far as managing the habitat of the passenger pigeon, for instance they did not allow the cutting of any tree a \u201cchief\u201d pigeon nested in [4]. Chief Pokagon of the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Potawatomi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> tribe credits strategies such as this for not only allowing the pigeon to maintain its numbers but actually increasing them [1]. By thinking about the needs of the pigeons and adjusting behaviors to accommodate those needs rather than freely hunting them, the population was able to continue on as a reliable food resource for the tribes that used them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, the connection between the two species went beyond the typical predator and prey relationship. To many </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indigenous people</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, the pigeons were not just food, they were a being. Passenger pigeons were included in the religion of some tribes through stories, song, and dance [1]. The Seneca believed that the pigeon gave its body to create their children. The passenger pigeon was so important to the Seneca that they termed albino ones \u201cchief of all pigeons\u201d and strictly forbade hunting them. The Cherokee and the Neutrals told similar stories of the bird as a guide to avoid starvation. The Seneca and the Iroquois opened their Maple Festival every year with a dance song about the bird. The Cherokee Green Corn Festival featured a dance mimicking a pigeon hawk in pursuit of a pigeon [4]. The pigeons held value in the lives of the people who benefited from them.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">European Arrival</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Europeans recorded their first passenger pigeon on July 1, 1534 [1]. Right away, colonizers of every walk of life made note of the massive number of pigeons Indigenous people had maintained.\u00a0 The average European enjoyed the sight, \u201c\u2026I was perfectly amazed to behold the air filled and the sun obscured by millions of pigeons\u2026\u201d [1]. Many accounts told the narrative of an undiminishable population. Schorger, a professional ornithologist confirmed this notion, stating that \u201cno other species of bird, to the best of our knowledge, ever approached the passenger pigeon in numbers\u201d [1]. More ornithologists like Alexander Wilson took records, \u201cIn the autumn of 1813\u2026I observed the pigeons flying from northeast to southwest, in greater numbers than I thought I had ever seen them before\u2026The light of the noon day was obscured as by an eclipse\u201d [5]. Even Leopold described them as a \u201cbiological storm\u201d that used the resources of the land to their advantage [6].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While everyone knew the birds to be copious, not everyone understood the science behind it. Ornithologists knew that the pigeons could thrive because they had ample food and habitat when the Europeans arrived. However, for the vast majority of Europeans who were not trained in biology, the flock of birds blocking out the sky was frightening and unexplainable. This is where the genre began to separate itself from Indigenous peoples\u2019 understanding of the bird. Europeans constructed urban legends in an effort to explain what was unknown to them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When only one acorn was found in pigeons\u2019 crop (food storage pouch), Europeans predicted death and sickness. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The evidence they saw supported their beliefs, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt is a common observation in some parts of this state, that when the Pigeons continue with us all the winter, we shall have a sickly summer and autumn\u201d [1].\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Diminishing</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As colonizers made themselves more at home in North America, they encroached on passenger pigeon habitat and depleted their numbers. The colonizers did not take wildlife management into consideration while hunting. Instead, they killed far more than they took and failed to leave young and nesting birds alone [1]. Extinction seemed entirely impossible, they did not see a need to ensure the next generation of pigeons could continue, it was understood as a given. To compound this, the birds were generally not thought of highly in European cultures. The passenger pigeon was merely a thing to exploit rather than a being to feel for. They began to disappear from the places humans occupied, retreating into what wilderness remained [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">People began to notice that the passenger pigeon populations were fading. Some states, like Ohio, actively avoided policies to protect the species, claiming </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cthe passenger pigeon needs no protection. Wonderfully prolific, having the vast forests of the North as its breeding grounds, travelling hundreds of miles in search of food, it is here to-day, and elsewhere to-morrow, and no ordinary destruction can lessen them or be missed from the myriad that are yearly produced\u201d [1]. Other states, particularly Wisconsin, wrote laws to protect the species: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person or persons to use any gun or guns or firearms, or in any manner to main, kill, destroy, or disturb any wild pigeon or pigeons at or within three miles of the place or places where they are gathered for the purpose of brooding their young, known as pigeon nestings\u201d. Laws along these lines were enacted in several states but no efforts were made to actually enforce them. Much of this was due to pushback by settlers to the laws. Farmers in particular protested any enforcement, worrying that allowing the pigeons to thrive would mean crop destruction [1]. To them, the pigeons were pests to get rid of, not preserve.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gone</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The last passenger pigeon, named Martha, was a resident of the Cincinnati Zoo up until her passing on September 1, 1914. She was named after First Lady Martha Washington and was housed with her companion named George. The pair never produced fertile eggs, the zoo\u2019s captive breeding effort was too late to save the population [1]. The end of the species \u201cremoved more individual birds than did all the other 129 [previously recorded bird] extinctions put together\u201d. They went extinct because of introduced species, chains of extinction, overexploitation, and habitat loss\u2014all four of these were human-driven factors. Captive breeding, regulating hunting, and habitat protection could have saved them. However, these efforts were seldom made and not done early enough in the population\u2019s decline [3]. The passenger pigeon was lost because of the genre Europeans created for it during the time it was still around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The majority of non-indigenous Americans only appreciated the passenger pigeon and shifted their genre once they were no longer around. People now found a soft spot for the birds in their memories, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAlas, the pigeons and the frosty morning hunts and the delectable pigeon-pie are gone, no more return\u201d. Artists incorporated these fond memories into their paintings, poems, and music. Monuments were erected around the United States inscribed with laments such as \u201cthis species became extinct through the avarice and thoughtlessness of Man\u201d and \u201cthe conservationist\u2019s voice was heard too late\u201d [3]. People regretted the fact that future generations would not get to see the bird in the sky so they attempted to etch the passenger pigeon into everyone\u2019s minds [6].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making an effort to remember the passenger pigeon is important because the species\u2019 story functions as a lesson and a guide for the future. However, in the past decade, the passenger pigeon is being forgotten. Many high school students are not taught about the population\u2019s time on Earth and why they are now gone, as shown by a case study in Pennsylvania [7]. If people are no longer talking about it then the same mistake will be made again. At the same time, there are also organizations, like the Project Passenger Pigeon founded in 2014, working to tell the parable \u201cthrough a documentary film, a new book, their website, social media, curricula, and a wide range of exhibits and programming for people of all ages\u201d [8]. However, a small group of thoughtful individuals will not be enough to save the next species from human destruction if the story of the passenger pigeon does not make it into enough of the right hands.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Experiment</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over the period of one month during March 2019, I surveyed teenagers regarding their passenger pigeon knowledge. At the time of the survey, the teenagers were high school or college students in the United States. The overall purpose of my survey was to investigate if young people are talking about the passenger pigeon in contemporary society. Of the fifty-one responses, three (6%) subjects spoke about the passenger pigeon accurately. Furthermore, eight (16%) subjects believed to know the true story of the passenger pigeon, all of those eight falsely stated that the passenger pigeon was used to carry messages. Eight (16%) subjects even claimed to have seen a live passenger pigeon since 2000.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My survey found that very few teenagers have heard the parable of the passenger pigeon\u2019s extinction. This group of people has gone through a large amount of schooling in their lives so far without being taught about the passenger pigeon despite its intertwining with significant historical events. The convenient fact about passenger pigeons is that they feel familiar to people since most have seen today\u2019s common pigeon, the rock dove. It is easy for the uninitiated to imagine what a passenger pigeon was like based off of what they know about rock doves. The parable of the passenger pigeons can be taught in any classroom\u2014science, history, art, and more.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The experiment shows that the genre is not being passed on. This is exactly why the way contemporary society talks about this species and its genre matters. Education that advocates for proper wildlife management and policy is the key to saving species from extinction.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The passenger pigeon species went from the world\u2019s largest bird population to complete extinction, due to mistreatment from European colonizers. My survey of high school teenagers shows that people are not learning from this parable. This species makes itself an ideal candidate because of the rapid severity of its decline. It is increasingly important that we care about our environment before it is too late to take action. The clock is ticking, the passenger pigeon told us so. If we can learn to mourn a bird we never met, we will not have the opportunity to mourn the birds we know.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Works Cited</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Schorger, A.W. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Passenger Pigeon: Its Natural History and Extinction.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin Press, 1955.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Dirk, Kerry. \u201cNavigating Genres\u201d. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Writing Spaces: Readings on Writing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, edited by Charles Lowe and Pavel Zemliansky, vol. 1, Parlor Press, 2010.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Avery, Mark. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A Message from Martha</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I originally wrote this piece for a UWP104E assignment. However, the topic remains relevant to people all around the world. In the past, it has been hard to visualize our individual impacts on the environment. COVID-19 has become a great example of how behavioral changes can drastically transform our surroundings. I would like my readers to understand the power of unity in the face of what might be the next global crisis, climate change.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency on January 30th 2020, the world has seen extreme changes as the daily lifestyle of almost everyone in the world has been rapidly altered [1]. The ongoing effort to slow the spread of the virus while sheltering-in-place has not been without sacrifice</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">countless people lost their jobs, most cannot physically go to school, and everyday activities have been significantly modified. However, this halt of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d has fascinating impacts on the environment. Stay-at-home orders shut down production in industrial facilities and power plants and minimized personal vehicle use [2]. With a major decrease in economic activity, highly polluted cities around the world are now seeing clearer skies. The seemingly dull, repetitive routine of quarantine life has allowed the environment to flourish.While consequences of COVID-19 include global economic devastation, the environment has seen both indirect positive and negative impacts as a result of stay-at-home orders and the declining economy. Regions with COVID-19 restrictions experienced a decrease in air and water pollution. These restrictions included a stop to nonessential work and travel as well as closing of restaurants and bars. Concurrently, the amount of single use products has significantly increased to limit the spread of the virus. Decreasing air pollution is a major milestone for our modern world, however, as the world returns to normal life, pollution levels will follow. Although a short term decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is not a sustainable way to support the environment, communities around the globe have witnessed the instantaneous impacts of our everyday habits on the environment due to COVID-19.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Drop in Atmospheric and Water Pollution</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, 91% of the world population lives in places where poor air quality exceeds the permissible limits set by the WHO [2]. Air quality is an important contributor to human health and living in an area with poor air quality can exacerbate the symptoms of COVID-19. According to the 2016 WHO report, air pollution contributes to 8% of total deaths in the world [2]. Countries that normally struggle with unhealthy air, such as China, USA, Italy, and Spain, have since seen clearer skies for the first time in decades after taking aggressive measures to slow the spread of the virus. There has been a dramatic decrease in the amount of CO</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, NO</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and particulate matter emitted in China with the halt of industrial operations with the decrease in demand for coal and crude oil (see fig. 1) [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Changes in nitrogen dioxide emission levels in China from before and after lockdown.\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fig. 1. Zambrano-Monserrate, Manuel A., et al. \u201cIndirect Effects of COVID-19 on the Environment.\u201d Science of The Total Environment, vol. 728, 20 Apr. 2020, p. 138813., doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138813.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since this same time last year, air pollution levels have dropped 50% in New York [1]. There has been a 25% decrease in air pollution since the start of this year in China, one of the largest manufacturing countries [1]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The closing of factories contributed to a 40% reduction in coal usage at</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> one of China\u2019s largest power plants [1]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The average coal consumption of power plants has reached its lowest point in the past four years [3]. Clearly, the outbreak has improved short term air quality and has contributed to reducing global carbon emissions. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fewer flights and social distancing guidelines have reduced carbon emissions as well as other forms of pollution. Tourism significantly decreased worldwide, and beaches around the world have been cleaned up. For example, citizens of Venice, Italy were amazed to see crystalline waters and healthy fish in their canals [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0Comparison of air quality in some of the biggest cities around the world before the COVID-19 pandemic and while the lockdown.\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fig. 2. Saadat, Saeida., et al. \u201cEnvironmental Perspective of COVID-19.\u201d Science of The Total Environment, vol. 728, 22 April 2020, p. 138870., doi:10.1016/j.scitptenv.2020.139815.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Increased Single Use Plastics</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In order to completely analyze the impact of COVID-19 on environmental health, the negative impacts on the environment from the virus are equally as important as the positive effects. Although travel restrictions have led to less pollution caused by tourism, the amount of single use plastics and medical equipment has significantly increased waste around the world. In the USA, there has been a significant increase in the amount of single-use personal protective equipment, such as masks and gloves [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Imagine the amount of trash created when millions of people use one or a couple of masks daily, single use gloves and hand sanitizers. With a population of eleven million people, the city of Wuhan produced an average of 200 tons of clinical trash on any single day in February 2020, compared to their previous average of fifty tons per day [1]. This number is four times the amount the city\u2019s only dedicated facility can incinerate per day [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The demand for plastics has increased as consumers move to online purchasing. Shelter-in-place guidelines established in most countries have driven consumers to increase their demand for online orders and home delivery [2].The increasing demand for shipping and packaging greatly increases the amount of waste produced as well as GHG emissions with increased activity in supply lines. Out of concern of spreading the virus through the plastic surfaces in recycling centers, some cities stopped their recycling programs in the U.S. [2]. Additionally, in some of these cities, citizens are not allowed to use reusable bags at grocery stores. Similarly, some European cities have seen restrictions within waste management. Italy has prohibited infected residents from sorting their personal household waste [2]. Industries have repealed the disposable bag bans, many have switched to single-use packaging, and online food ordering has increased in popularity [2]. The consumption of single use plastics has skyrocketed to limit transmission [1, 3]. Suspension of sustainable waste management practices potentially escalate environmental pollution.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Medical wastes generated during COVID-19 pandemic in the environment.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fig. 3. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Saadat, Saeida., et al. \u201cEnvironmental Perspective of COVID-19.\u201d Science of The Total Environment, vol. 728, 22 April 2020, p. 138870., doi:10.1016/j.scitptenv.2020.139815.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Where Do We Go From Here?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over the last few months, people were enamoured by the modern-day pollution that vanished before their eyes. Strict stay-at-home orders decreased the amount of air and water pollution in otherwise unhealthy cities. Contrarily, the considerable increase in single use plastics may have a lasting negative impact on the environment. Although these outcomes may be hard to compare in magnitude, they help put into perspective the larger picture. Short term change is not a sustainable way to clean up the environment especially when it occurs alongside economic devastation. Before the pandemic, individual action against climate change felt like an abstract idea, out of reach due to its lack of immediacy. Now, the world has seen changes to our environment from worldwide behavior. Visible skies and vibrant waterways are distinguishable changes that are legitimate grounds to build momentum and take action for a healthier future. Although the pandemic may not have a drastic impact on the future of the environment itself due to conflicting effects, it can instigate discussion to improve personal actions that impact the environment. Long-term structural change and individual behavior changes are critical in combating environmental pollution. Moving forward, it is imperative that the unification of collective conscious behavior be a driving force to combat climate change. If neglected, climate change is likely to take many lives in the future, portraying this pandemic as a minor devastation. Let the urgency of our united global response to COVID-19 influence our future response to the next global crisis; climate change.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[1] Saadat, Saeida., et al. \u201cEnvironmental Perspective of COVID-19.\u201d Science of The Total\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Environment, vol. 728, 22 April 2020, p. 138870., doi:10.1016/j.scitptenv.2020.139815.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[3] Wang, Qiang, and Min Su. \u201cA Preliminary Assessment of the Impact of COVID-19 on\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Environment \u2013 A Case Study of China.\u201d Science of The Total Environment, vol. 728, 22\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Apr. 2020, p. 138915., doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138915.<br/>\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[2] Zambrano-Monserrate, Manuel A., et al. \u201cIndirect Effects of COVID-19 on the\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Environment.\u201d Science of The Total Environment, vol. 728, 20 Apr. 2020, p. 138813.,\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138813.</span></p>\n</div>"

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4>\u00a0 Climate change is an important topic and must be discussed in order to mitigate the severe consequences. Unbeknownst to most people, however, coffee is also heavily impacted by climate change due to the sensitive conditions necessary for proper cultivation. I hope I can bring to light some of the less serious impacts of climate change and how something normal, like coffee, may become extinct without interference.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over fifty percent of Americans enjoy a daily cup of coffee, with over 500 million cups of coffee\u00a0 served everyday. Unfortunately, with the increasing temperatures due to climate change, coffee is at high risk of extinction. However, with new advances in technology, coffee can now be grown in a wider range of environmental conditions. Specifically, the integration of modern technology to pre-existing growing practices and the use of artificial intelligence have both contributed to making a future with coffee a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To understand the new developing technologies, it is crucial to understand the severity of climate change and how it specifically affects the coffee production business. Given the rapidly increasing rate of global temperatures, coffee will likely be much more expensive and be of a much lower level of quality within just 30 years. On top of this, the amount of land that is available for coffee growing will be cut in half by 2050, according to Climate Institute, a company in Australia. Coffee is grown mostly in tropical regions, like Honduras and Brazil, which also happen to be the regions hardest hit by climate change. In fact, the top countries that are most affected by climate change are the same countries where the majority of the world\u2019s coffee beans are grown.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This becomes problematic as coffee beans are also extremely sensitive to temperatures outside of their ideal growing temperature. Most coffee beans will only grow in the range of 18\u00b0C to 21\u00b0C at high altitudes. They also require a perfect amount of rain, as anything outside of these optimal conditions will damage or even kill the plants. Climate change has already had its effects on coffee production around the world. Heavy rains in Columbia, droughts in Indonesia, and coffee leaf rust (a fungus that attacks coffee bean leaves) in Central and South America have significantly decreased the coffee yield in the past few years. These are only a few of the many examples of how coffee growers are struggling to maintain their crop yield each year [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One way coffee growers are preparing for climate change is by engineering a new resistant strain of coffee beans. Currently, only one type of coffee bean, Arabica, dominates the entire industry. Arabica is known for its high quality flavor and aroma, but lacks genetic diversity, commonly leaving it susceptible to coffee leaf rust [2]. The coffee leaf rust fungus preys on the leaves of coffee plants, and eats away at the leaf until an orange-brown color is left instead of the previous green leaf, thus destroying the plant\u2019s ability to make its own energy [3]. The lack of genetic diversity allows for this fungus to spread rampantly across coffee bean farms. For instance, if one strain of the fungus affects a particular variety of Arabica, it is also extremely likely that other Arabica plants will also be afflicted [2]. With increasing temperatures already posing a greater threat to plants, the leaf rust fungus is expected to have an even more apparent impact on coffee yield. In addition, the availability of farmable land is decreasing, as coffee plants only grow in a narrow range, a range that is shrinking due to increasing global temperatures. However, creating a hybrid coffee bean can resolve this problem by choosing strains in hopes of achieving a desired quality, such as coffee leaf rust resistance [2].\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Coffee breeder William Solano works at the tropical agricultural research and higher education center (CATIE) in Costa Rica doing just that. He works on creating coffee hybrids by combining genetically distant yet complementary coffee strains in hopes to achieve a product that takes in characteristics from each parent coffee strain [3]. At CATIE, he created the Centroamericano coffee bean, a cross between the Ethiopian landrace variety Rume Sudan and another coffee bean called T5296, which is known for its coffee leaf rust resistance [2]. On its own, the Centroamericano has proven to be twenty percent more productive than other coffee beans and is tolerant to coffee leaf rust. However, it soon became clear that it fares better against the effects of climate change as well, as it can survive temperatures below freezing. This was an especially surprising find as the plant was originally designed with only disease resistance in mind [3].\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On top of changing the coffee bean, scientists are also finding a way to use new technologies to make coffee farming more efficient. The most promising example seen so far has been the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) to the coffee growing business. AI technology now allows farmers to accurately analyze soil fertility properties and compute an estimation of coffee yields [4]. The American technology company IBM has developed an AI-powered device that does just that. The device, called the AgroPad, is portable and about the size of a business card. This device has the capability to quickly analyze the soil to check for chemical composition, allowing coffee farmers to make educated decisions on how to manage their crops. Coffee growers can improve sustainability of their crops as well as save money since they know the amount of water and fertilizer that would be most beneficial to the crop to maximize yield.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To activate the device, only a small sample size is needed. The sample can either be a drop of water or a liquid soil extract that is produced from a pea-sized clump of dirt, depending on the type of analysis needed. Within about 10 seconds, the device will generate a report using a microfluidics chip inside that performs data analysis. The device can give accurate information on the pH, and amount of various chemicals, such as nitrite, aluminum, magnesium, and chloride. This information is given in the form of circles that correlate to the soil composition. These circles give colorimetric test results, where each circle will represent the amount of a specific chemical that is in the sample [6]. The figure below shows what a sample report may look like. Once this output is given out by the AgroPad, the farmer can use an app to take a picture of the output where the app will read the data. The implementation of this device could allow coffee to be grown in more parts of the world as it will be evident what specifically must be done to ensure the productive growing of coffee in these fields [5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dedicated mobile app scanning of a sample report created by AgroPad</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fig. 1.

Hopefully, more technological advances will continue to rise over the years giving hope to both coffee growers and coffee drinkers alike around the globe.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Sources</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Campoy, Ana. \u201cAnother Species Threatened by Climate Change: Your Morning Cup of Coffee.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Quartz</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Quartz, 3 Sept. 2016, qz.com/773015/climate-change-will-kill-coffee-by-2100/.

These flexible models are powerful in identifying the mechanisms driving animal movement; however, when fed spatially or temporally coarse environmental data, IBMs can often produce inaccurate model outcomes. Here, we investigate how model adaptations can mitigate negative consequences of poor data using an IBM of blue whales. Specifically, we find that models running on coarse data lead the simulated whale agents to clump together in their foraging behaviors and migrations paths. Algorithm adaptations, like altering the rate at which the whales update their locations, can reduce the locational clustering effect incited by spatially coarse data, and introducing available fine data to coarse data can mitigate the behavioral inaccuracies caused by temporally coarse data. These changes improve verified utilization distributions of whale positions, behavioral state plots, and associated metrics.</span></p>\n<p><h4>1 Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recognizing how species interact and forage within their environment is an important aspect for understanding animal migrations. Predicting movement and behaviors given environmental conditions is crucial for understanding how changes in environment, like climate change, will affect future migrations. Though many species migrate, we focus on the foraging behaviors of Northern Pacific blue whales.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The largest animal to have ever lived, North Pacific blue whales are well known marine mammals and seasonal migrators [</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In winter, they can be found in breeding grounds off the coast of Mexico and Baja California; during summer and fall, they migrate to foraging grounds off the coast of California. Blue whales forage only on krill and need to consume large amounts of prey to meet their energetic needs. Their seasonal foraging is timed with coastal upwelling in the California current system, which leads to high densities of krill. Blue whales are also a threatened species, and their population growth is hindered by human intervention in the form of shipping lanes, discarded fishing gear, and changing climate [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Modeling is a common method used to understand animal migrations and foraging behavior. Individual Based Models, or IBMs, treat individual animals as autonomous agents whose movements and behaviors are governed by a set of probabilistic rules. An example of this is the IBM in [2]. This model has individual, autonomous, simulated blue whale agents interact with and move through a domain: a restricted geographic area throughout which the agents are allowed to move; at any time they occupy either a transit or forage state. The state is selected based on krill density and sea surface temperature (SST) [2]. This model was used to evaluate the relative importance of prey and environmental factors in driving movement distributions of whales. Previously, the IBM was only run effectively on very fine spatiotemporal resolution Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) data: computer generated sea data that is assimilative and hindcast, meaning that it gives realistic ocean conditions constructed from past observations. With ROMS being computationally expensive to generate and not available in real time, ROMS data is not feasible to use for current prediction purposes.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our long-term goal is to predict real whale locations and behaviors by simulating whale agents on current environmental conditions using real-time satellite data. However, satellite data is messy and often of poor resolution, having spatiotemporal resolutions as coarse as 12 km grid cells and 8 day time-steps compared to the ROMS data\u2019s 3 km and 1 day resolutions. A time-step is the length of time between each day for which the satellite has collected data. This poor resolution data yields inaccurate predictions and misleading results when applied to the blue whale IBM models.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, created using output from our own models, highlights that models run on low resolution data return misleading predictions of whale positions, forecasting them to be clustered in much smaller areas than they actually are. In Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which shows the proportion of whale agents foraging over time and gives a sense of population-level behaviors, it can be seen that the models inaccurately recreate whale behavior by causing a behavioral update lag that corrects itself in jumps. Similarly unrealistic predictions are expected for IBMs of other animal populations.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this study, our objective is to understand how to adapt the IBM developed by Dodson et al., as well as the data, to produce realistic predictions in spite of poor input resolution [2]. To do so, we will coarsen the original ROMS data to mimic poor satellite data, then compare the results of the IBM run on the coarse data to the results of the model run on the unaltered ROMS data. From there, we will formulate model adaptations that will yield accurate results from the IBM, even when run on coarse data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the methods section, we detail the functions of the IBM, our data manipulation methods, and\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1: Contour map comparing the 95% utilization distribution map for the Gold Standard and 12 km resolution on September 1, 2008.

In the results, we describe the efficacy of our solutions, showing quantitatively and qualitatively how they improve the model output. We analyze these results, their advantages, shortcomings, and future implications in the discussion section.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>2 Methods</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.1 The ROMS Data\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throughout the study, we utilized ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) Data, with two geospatial fields: sea surface temperature (SST) and krill [</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">] [</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">]. The domain is located off the California coast (32 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2212 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">42</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u25e6</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">N </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Latitude and 116 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2212 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">128</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u25e6</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">W </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Longitude) for the year 2008.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The datasets are identical in shape and structure, but contain different information: SST is sea surface temperature in Celsius and krill is the relative density with values between 0 and 1. The resolution of this data, which we will henceforth refer to as the \u2018gold standard\u2019, is 3 km spatial and 1 day temporal. Imagine the environmental data to be two-dimensional maps stacked vertically, one for each time interval (Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.2 Description of the IBM\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our IBM, or individual based model, takes inputs of sea surface temperature (SST) and krill data as environmental information that whale agents interact with and use to inform their movements around the domain. This choice of input is motivated by the fact that real-life whales partially decide their movements based on krill availability, which is influenced by sea surface temperature. Note that all mentions of whales from this point onward refer to the simulated whale agents in the IBM. As they progress through the model, the whales can occupy either a transit state (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">), where they simply travel through the domain, or a foraging state (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">), where they \u201cforage\u201d for krill; the movement distribution of each state is dictated by the step length and turning angle variables. These behavioral states are inspired by the analysis of blue whale tagging data in [5]. This type of model\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 2: Proportion of population foraging over time for the Gold Standard and 8 day resolution.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is also referred to as a \u201cstate-switching\u201d or \u201csemi-Markovian\u201d model, respectively because the whales switch to random states and because the switch depends largely on their current and previous locations. In a fully Markovian model, the state variable would not depend at all on past information, only current.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Movement updates are parametrized by step lengths and turning angles. On any position update, the turning angle determines at what angle from its current trajectory a whale should turn, and the step length determines how far in that direction to travel. For each whale these parameters are drawn from respective Gamma and Von Mises, two probability distributions with their own parameters </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00b5 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u03c3</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Distinct distributions are defined for whales in the foraging versus transit state. The distributions of the step length and turning angle are also functions of the time intervals given as parameters in the model. They have moments </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00b5 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">= h </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00b7 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3700, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u03c3 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">= h </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00b7 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2150 for the transiting state, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00b5 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">= h </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00b7 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1050, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u03c3 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">= h </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00b7 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">970 foraging state [5]. Here, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">h </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">represents the number of hours in one time-step (the amount of time between a location update) as follows:\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 3: Visualization of the SST and krill data as a 3-dimensional tensor.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(a) Forage state</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(b) Transit state\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 4: Step length probability distributions for whales in forage or transit state for rate 1, 2, and 4.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Note that, while the step length and turning angle themselves are random, the absolute direction in which the whale turns depends on its current and previous location, which form the start of the\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">zero degree angle from which the whale will turn. Hence, the \u201csemi-Markovian\u201d reference. At every update, each individual reads its local SST and krill conditions, which influence the probability of foraging through a distribution defined by\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">where </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">z </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">= 3 is a normalization parameter that ensures that the probability does not exceed 1, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">w</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">= 1 and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">w</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">= 2 are weights, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">P </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SST </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">P </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">krill</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">are the respective probability distributions of foraging given SST and krill.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lower SST and higher krill densities in a whale\u2019s surroundings are associated with an increased likelihood of it either switching to or continuing in the foraging state (Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(a) Based on surrounding SST\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(b) Based on surrounding krill density\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 5: Probability of a whale foraging based on its environment.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To summarize the process: the IBM is initiated on May 1st in the southern portion of the domain, and at each update, the whales\u2019 movement aligns with a movement distance based on the distributions in Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and their current location. Their foraging state is determined from their environmental conditions. This update cycle repeats until the end of the simulation, which, in this case, is the end of the year.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.3 Data Coarsening in Space and Time\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We manipulated the ROMS data to mimic the data collection shortcomings of satellites to achieve data coarsening. Specifically, satellite readings are plagued by coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. These are in part due to a satellite\u2019s movement, type of readings, and presence of cloud cover. Making the ROMS data \u2018bad\u2019 in the way that satellite data is flawed required coarsening the data in space and time.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spatial coarsening of the SST and krill ROMS data was accomplished through Matlab\u2019s meshgrid and interp3 functions, for which the input data was the original 3 km spatial resolution, and returned it in lower resolutions of 6 km, 9 km, and 12 km. These coarser resolutions were selected to match available satellite data and test the limits of our methods.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To make up for missing data over time, satellites tend to use moving means: averaging the data over an interval, shifting the interval forward, and repeating the process; thus, our temporal coarsening was accomplished through averaging the data over time. To obtain coarsened data with an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">n\u2212</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">day resolution, we averaged the data in every </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">n </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">time-slices. The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">n </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">slices were compressed into a single slice, resulting in a total of 1</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">/n </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">times the number of original time-slices. We performed this temporal averaging for 3 days and 8 days to mimic time resolutions consistent with satellite data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 6: SST data from September 1, 2008, coarsened temporally and spatially. The axes of each map show the number of grid cells from the bottom left corner.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Note that minor alterations to the IBM\u2019s parameters, not mentioned because of their triviality, were required so that the model would run given the new dimensions of the data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.4 Issues from Coarser Data\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once we had coarsened the data, feeding it into the IBM no longer resulted in the same whale behavior or locations as the gold standard, which used data with 3 km, 1 day spatiotemporal resolution. Unlike many of the models based on coarser data, the gold standard results in whale locations spread over the coast with continuous population foraging behavior. In model iterations parametrized by the more extreme resolutions, like 12 km in space or averaged over 8 days in time, using the coarse data resulted in perceiving the whale population to act completely differently.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When tracking movement based on data coarsened in space (Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">), the whales tended to move closer to each other as the simulation progressed, resulting in them clustering unrealistically at the coast instead of being spread over the domain. Adding temporal coarsening to the data only exacerbated this clumping effect.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to causing the whales to cluster over time, temporal coarsening alone also altered</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 7: Zoomed in utilization distribution maps of spatially coarse data vs. the gold standard. Curves show the 95% contour of the UDs. The full domain is shown on the right, with the regions on the left indicated by the orange box.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">whale behavior. Abrupt jumps in the percentage of whales foraging became apparent at the end of each time-slice, making the whales\u2019 feeding behavior appear unrealistically stepwise for extremely coarse time (Figure</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 8: Percentage of population foraging over time for temporally coarse data vs. the gold standard.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These deviations from the gold standard output required that we alter the IBM or its inputs such that the IBM would continue to produce realistic results, even with poor data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.5 Model Adaptations: Spatial\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In an effort to have the IBM running on coarse data reproduce the same movement and behavioral patterns as the gold standard IBM running on the gold standard ROMS data, we modified parts of its algorithm; in particular, we scaled the time-steps of the IBM.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To mitigate the issues that arose specifically from spatially coarse data, we adjusted the rate at which the whales\u2019 locations and behavioral states were updated. In the gold standard model, the whales take 4 steps per day (every 6 hours), with step length selected from a Gamma distribution with parameters </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00b5</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u03c3</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In order to recover realistic whale movements,\u00a0 i.e. to have the whales move the same distance over the same amount of time, we scaled this distribution by a parameter </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">h, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">defined in equation 1, to accommodate for the increased size of grid cells caused by coarse spatial data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From the gold standard model\u2019s rate of 4 time-steps, we changed our rates to 1 and 2, corresponding, respectively, to time-steps of 24 and 12 hours. This way, the whales updated locations less often, but took larger steps that were matched to the larger grid cells [5], preventing them from getting trapped in grid cells due to limited movement ability, allowing them to move freely as they did when basing their movements on the ROMS data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.6 Model Adaptations: Temporal\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To mitigate the disruption to whale behavior caused by temporally coarse data in the IBM, we introduced temporally finer data (when available) to the coarsened data, resulting in a hybrid coarse-fine environmental dataset that we could pass to the IBM. Our intention was to develop a methodology for handling temporally coarse input data while remaining consistent with the available satellite data. Temporally finer satellite data (e.g. 1 day, or daily) is often prohibitively sparse for IBM use due to missing data from clouds or the location of the satellite, but 8-day averages are sufficiently dense. We used this structure to our advantage and augmented the coarse data with available finer resolutions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We regard the coarse data as our primary input, and the fine data as our secondary input. First, we created gaps in the coarse data by using Matlab\u2019s randi function to select 30% of the indices in the data matrix uniformly at random. Then, to fill in the gaps in the coarse data, we replaced the randomly selected indices of the coarse data with the fine. In short, given temporally coarse data, we backed it up, or combined it with data of similarly coarse spatial, but finer temporal (1 day) resolution. For example, we might modify the 6 km, 8 day coarse data by replacing 30% of it with the finer 6 km, 1 day data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Note that combining data of different resolutions in this way required some interpolation of the coarser data to the larger dimensions of the fine.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before selecting 70% as the ratio of temporally coarse data, we analyzed real GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) satellite data recorded from the same area of the ocean as our ROMS data. Measurements of the GOES data are gathered by the GOES Imager, a multi-channel radiometer carried aboard the satellite. This satellite data is available in 6 km spatial resolution (about 0.05 degree latitude-longitudinal resolution) and in 1, 3, 8, 14, and 30 day composites averaged in time. Satellite SST data was extracted from NOAA GOES Imager Western Hemisphere satellite and accessed via [</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">]. Examples of data with few holes and many holes can respectively be found in Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">9</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(a) A day with very few holes</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(b) A day with many holes\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 9: SST GOES satellite data on days with varying amounts of holes. Dark blue indicates missing data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Plotting the percentage of the data that was missing (Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">10</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) showed that the highest percentage of clouds at any time, for the first temporal resolution (1 day), was 80%, with an average of 40%. That is, on any given day, there is a wide range of data that might be missing. We also tested a range of coarse to fine ratios (i.e. percentages of missing data) on our own data, and the lowest percentage of fine data that returned reasonably improved results from no fine data at all was 30%. Thus, in what follows, we fix 30% as the amount of fine data to introduce, and 70% as the amount of \u2018missing\u2019 or coarse data. The improvements will be further discussed in the Results section; see table </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2.7 Metrics\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The behaviors that we are trying to replicate in the gold standard are the foraging behaviors over time and over the whales\u2019 habitat area. We used two established metrics to compare model outputs between the adjustments, as well as a third that we designed to be a combination of the two.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The L2 norm, or the Mean Square Error, was used to measure how close the whales\u2019 foraging behavior resulting from any of the models was to that of the gold standard model output. We extracted the vector of the percentage of whales foraging over time for both models and, after applying a moving mean, compared them using the L2 norm of the data. This metric provided an understanding of the foraging behaviors of the whale population through time. We define\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Note that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">X</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GS </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">represents the output produced by the gold standard model. Lower L2 norms indicate a more accurate reproduction of the gold standard outcomes, and an L2 norm of zero indicates that the models have identical foraging behavior.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 10: Percentage of the missing data for real, daily satellite GOES data. Dashed vertical lines indicate the beginning of each month.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Utilization distributions are probability distributions built from the data points of individual positions and are commonly used to understand and compare animal habitats. To quantify the accuracy of the utilization distribution produced by a given model, we used the volume intersection (\u2018VI\u2019 in the adehabitathr R package) between the utilization distribution of the final positions of the whales from the given model versus the gold standard model. The positions were taken from September 1, 2008, a date by which the whales had had sufficient time to explore and interact with the domain. This gives a measure of how close the model output is to the gold standard in terms of whale positions. We refer to this volume as the \u2018VI\u2019. The equation for the VI integral is\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">for model run </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">X </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">compared to the gold standard model at all points (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">x, y</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) in our domain.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because we are measuring overlap of the utilization distributions, a higher value indicates better model performance, with the maximum being 1. Due to the stochastic, meaning somewhat random, nature of the model, a VI value of 1 was not achieved even by comparing two of the same model runs from the gold standard, which returned an overlap value of around 99%; thus, for our purposes, VI values near 0.9 are considered good.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The UDs and VI values were computed using R. We formatted the final whale positions of each model, labeled by the resolution of its input data, into a dataframe, then used the kerneloverlap and kernelUD functions from the R (version 4.0.2) package adehabitatHR to return the VI overlap value [7]. Our choice of setting the method argument to \u2019VI\u2019 gave us the computed volume of intersection between the gold standard and coarse data model outputs.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finally, our own \u2206 metric is the combination of the L2 and VI norms: for a model outcome </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">X</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, we\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">defined\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since all efforts to adapt the model were done in order to produce equivalent results to the gold standard when fed into the simulator, our goal was to minimize the \u2206 of the model; i.e. minimize the L2 and maximize the VI values. We measured the effectiveness of a model adjustment by quantifying model improvement using the fold decrease in \u2206 values before and after the adjustment was applied.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>3 Results</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3.1 Changing Rate Counteracts Spatially Coarsened Data\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We focus first on purely spatially coarsened data, which has the same 1 day temporal resolution as the data used in the gold standard. The model run on spatially coarsened data resulted in unrealistic behaviors from the whales: resolutions lower than the gold standard of 3 km prevented the whales from exploring the entirety of the domain and caused them to move closer together as the IBM progressed. In particular, the agents ended up in clusters near the coast instead of spread over the domain. In an attempt to recreate the spread-out behavior of the gold standard IBM, we decreased the rate at which the whales updated their locations and behavioral states.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Without any temporal coarsening, adjusting the rates significantly mitigated the clustering effects of spatial coarsening on the locations of the whales. Changing the rate in the IBM caused the whales to forage in generally the same areas with coarse data as they did with the gold standard data. The utilization distributions of the whales\u2019 positions on the date September 1, which we noted was chosen as a sufficiently advanced time in the simulation to show model- representative whale behaviors (Figure </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">), became visibly more similar to that of the gold standard.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Table 1: Original and corrected VI for spatially coarsened data, with fold decrease in \u2206 values.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The original VI values for the coarse data for 9 km, and 12 km were 0.705, 0.480, and 0.256 respectively. Recall that higher VI values, closer to the maximum of 1, are more desirable. After adjusting the rate, these values became 0.710, 0.654, and 0.549; all improvements, even to the 6 km, which show less dramatic improvement due to already being relatively close to the gold standard. In addition , before changing the rate, the \u2206 values were about 1.9, 2.8, and 3.0; all very high and\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 11: Utilization distribution maps of spatially coarsened data with and without altered rates.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">indicative of undesirable model results that did not align with the gold standard. After changing the rate, these values reduced to 1.2, 1.4, and 1.7; at minimum a 1.6-fold decrease each, with the 9 and 12 km resolutions seeing the greatest favorable impacts.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3.2 Introducing Finer Data Counteracts Temporally Coarsened Data\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We now consider purely temporally coarsened data, keeping the spatial resolution constant at 3 km. Recall that coarsening the data temporally caused issues with population-level whale foraging behavior. For lower temporal resolutions than the gold standard\u2019s 1 day, the whales experienced abrupt, en masse changes in foraging state, causing the percentage of whales foraging over time to look unrealistically segmented. To mitigate this effect, we introduced finer data as a replacement for 30% of the coarse data as described in the Methods section. With the addition of the finer data, the foraging percentages were visually less step-like and numerically closer to the gold standard results.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Table 2: L2 norms for temporally coarsened data before and after the addition of 30% 1 day data, with fold decrease in \u2206 values.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When naively fed temporally coarse data, i.e. when no changes are made to the data or the model to counter the effects of the temporal coarseness, the IBM results had \u2206 values of 1.4 and 2.0 respectively for 3 day and 8 day. These high \u2206 values are largely due to jump-like behaviors in the percentage of whales foraging. After replacing 30% of the coarse data with available fine data, we found that the \u2206 values decreased over 1.6-fold and 2-old, to a value near 1. Similarly, the L2 norms decreased, as desired, from 1.2 and 1.7 to 0.77 and 0.93 for the coarse temporal resolutions of 3 day and 8 day.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 12: Proportion of the population foraging over time for temporally coarsened data with and without added finer data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3.3 Combined Spatial and Temporal Fixes\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Negative influences on whale foraging behaviors were amplified when the environmental data had both poor spatial and temporal resolutions: with no fixes, the spatiotemporally coarsened data had a minimum \u2206 of 3 across all resolutions. Combining the fixes by substituting available fine data, then changing model rate was successful in improving the behaviors in the combined coarseness scenario. By reducing the jumps in the number of whales in each behavioral state, and increasing the overlap between the utilization distributions of the corrected and gold standard models, we were able to decrease the \u2206 value to be capped at 1.6. This was at least a 2.6-fold decrease in \u2206s for each of the spatiotemporally coarsened datasets, greater than for any of the adjustments applied to data that was coarse in only one dimension.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Table 3: Fold decrease in \u2206 for all spatiotemporal coarsening combinations.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 13: Bar chart of \u2206 values for spatiotemporally coarse data before and after algorithm modifications.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>4 Discussion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our long-term goal was to run the IBM on satellite data to predict real-time locations of blue whales. However, the IBM had only been shown to produce realistic predictions on fine-scale input data. Specifically, gaps and poor resolution of SST and krill data would lead to inaccurate simulations and predictions of whale movements. To the end of mimicking this \u2018bad\u2019 data, we coarsened our data spatially and temporally. By decreasing the rate at which the whales updated their locations and introducing available fine data to the coarse data, we successfully improved\u00a0 the results of the IBM when running on coarse data, as measured by the VI, L2, and \u2206 metrics,.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of our two directions of coarsening, the first we dealt with was spatial. The lower spatial resolution (e.g. 12 km instead of the gold standard 3 km), or larger grid cells, caused the whales to clump together over time instead of exploring the entire domain. We anticipated that this was because the increased size of grid cells caused the whales to be trapped in areas of high foraging; the whales\u2019 step lengths were too short to exit areas with high foraging probability. Since the step lengths are a function of the step rate, with larger average lengths corresponding to lower rates, by decreasing the rate at which the whales updated locations, the step length became better aligned with the spatial size of the grid cells. Larger step lengths prevented the whales from getting stuck in rich foraging locations and allowed agents to step out of a grid cell and continue to explore the domain. For example, changing the update from 6 to 24 hours (rate 4 to rate 1) shifted the average step length of foraging from 6.3 km to 25 km. The larger average step length then allowed individuals to exit a 12 km grid cell and continue to explore the domain.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our second direction of coarsening was temporal; lower temporal resolutions were apparent in sudden changes in the percentage of whales foraging. The jump-like behaviors were due to the whales operating on old information: the coarser the temporal resolution, the more outdated the\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">whales\u2019 knowledge of their surroundings. Our model correction was to provide the agents with the most up to date information when possible. Adding finer data into the coarse data removed the unrealistic jumps in the whales\u2019 behavior and yielded population-level foraging activity that better resembled the gold standard.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our solution for temporal coarsening is particularly powerful because of its scale: we only required 30% of the coarse data to be randomly replaced with the fine to see great improvement. Analysis of GOES satellite data showed that the average missing data during the summer and fall, commonly due to cloud cover, is usually less than 40% and rarely exceeds 70%. Thus, utilizing 30% of 1 day temporal resolution data with 70% of temporally coarse data is a realistic quantity, and actually uses the upper bound of 70% for the amount of missing satellite data. We introduced the fine data to the coarse data uniformly at random as the natural first step, since it did not require any assumptions about the locations or shapes of the missing data. One next step would be to target localized, perhaps even moving, regions for more \u2018cloud-like\u2019 replacement.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The methods we develop here are not at all unique to modeling blue whale populations; they can be applied to any individual based model in which the agents make decisions based on environmental input data. These solutions are particularly useful for models that, like ours, have inputs that are dynamic in space and time; nearly any IBM for animal movement could be similarly adapted. By incorporating finer temporal data when possible and aligning the step lengths to be of the same order as the spatial grid resolution, we believe other individual based models can be used with coarse environmental data to make predictions that are considerably more similar to those they might make with finer, more accurate data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The problem of predicting animal behavior based on environmental conditions is an important one, especially with continually changing impacts from humans and climate change. With these results and further exploration in our suggested direction, it is our hope that it will be possible to make accurate, real-time predictions of whale positions based on satellite data.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scales KL, Hazel EL, Jacox Mg, Edwards CA, Boustany AM, Oliver MJ, Bograd SJ. 2017.

I wrote this piece partially because I have always fostered an interest in invasive species \u2014 how they enter, alter, and succeed in ecosystems. And, how we as scientists and policymakers address these threats to native ecosystems. I was also compelled to write this review because of the abundance of recent literature and the lack of another review, to my knowledge, that covered the same topics as I intended to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I hope that readers walk away from this piece with a greater understanding of the Burmese python in the Florida Everglades \u2014 their invasion, success, and alterations to a fragile and precious ecosystem. I wish for readers to recognize the connections that I have made, combing through the literature, and I wish for them to make their own connections, too. There is no greater gift than your engagement with my work.</span></p>\n<h3 data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"30\"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Southern Florida\u2019s Greater Everglades Ecosystem (GEE) once included over 8 million acres of 0.5-2.0 foot deep wetland from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes just south of Orlando to the southern tip of Florida Bay [1]. Now, the GEE is estimated to be half of its historical size and is fragmented into various national, state, regional, and local parks as well as more than 12 wildlife refuges and marine preserves [2, 3, 4]. Everglades National Park (ENP), one of the federally protected regions of the GEE, only includes 1.5 million acres of this vast ecosystem [5]. However, even within the protected region of ENP, canals, pump stations, and roads have been\u00a0 constructed to increase human accessibility to the Everglades, severely altering precise hydrological processes [1, 6]. These hydrological alterations, encroaching human settlements, degraded water quality, anthropogenic climate change, and the introduction of invasive species all pose significant threats to the GEE, and work in conjunction to increase negative effects on the GEE [4].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps the most infamous invasive species in the U.S., the Burmese python is the most well known threat to the GEE </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Python molurus bivittatus). </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The snakes\u2019 long lifespan, high fecundity or ability to produce offspring, as well as their generalist lifestyle which allows them to adapt their behavior and dietary habits to their environment, has allowed a small number of pythons to establish and thrive in the GEE [7]. Currently, Burmese pythons are drastically altering trophic structures as well as introducing and transmitting disease in the GEE. Furthermore, Burmese pythons have and have the potential to extend their range northward, putting other ecosystems and species at risk. A comprehensive literature review is required to inform policy decisions and assess the risk posed by Burmese pythons beyond the GEE.</span></p>\n<h3 data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"30\"><h4>Background</h4></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Native to Southeast Asia, the Burmese python was introduced into the GEE in the 1980s during a boom in the exotic pet trade and the subsequent release of the snakes into the Everglades by owners [7]. Since being first recognized in ENP in 2000, the invasive range of the Burmese python has rapidly expanded to the entirety of ENP and much of Big Cypress National Preserve [8]. However, population estimates have been hindered by the combination of cryptic python behavior (including long periods of inactivity), excellent natural camouflage, and human park management goals that include the removal of every python encountered without necessarily documenting the removed numbers [9]. These factors have caused extremely low python detection probabilities, ranging from </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">0.0001 to 0.0146</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> using visual surveys and radio transmitters [9]. Given low detection probability, population estimates range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands [9, 10]. Better population estimates are required for effective management strategies and to monitor changing populations of pythons [9].</span></p>\n<h3 data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"30\">Northward Range Expansion</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Burmese pythons exhibit seasonal habitat preference, primarily choosing covered habitats close to water, though recent studies have found evidence that they may also be attracted to human development [11-17]. Smith et al. (2021) found that within their native range in Thailand, Burmese pythons do not avoid human dominated landscapes. Similarly, Bartoszek et al. (2021) found that in a northwest portion of ENP, within their invasive range, Burmese python hotspots were merely 515 meters from urban development on average. Researchers attributed this proximity to high quantities of readily available prey in these areas, in the form of livestock and birds attracted to the artificial lakes [11, 16]. However, egg clutches deposited in or near urban areas may exhibit lower survival rates than those in other habitats [8]. Though juveniles can travel long distances, particularly through use of agricultural canals, Pittman &amp; Bartoszek (2021) hypothesize that in fact adult pythons with more sophisticated navigational capacities are the population driving expansion [18]. Adult sufficiency in and attraction to urban environments indicates that northward Burmese python expansion may not be hindered by human settlements.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Besides suitable habitat, the range of ectotherms such as the Burmese python is typically limited by climate and/or the possession of behavioral adaptations such as retreating into underground refugia during winter months [19]. Though a conservative estimate allows Burmese pythons to survive for short periods of time at 5 \u00b0C,, temperatures must be above 16 \u00b0C in order for them to maintain digestion [19]. In isolation, these requirements make further expansion of the Burmese python in more northern parts of Florida extremely unlikely without the additional development of hibernation behaviors [19]. However, other researchers have found evidence of rapid adaptation for increased thermal tolerance after an extreme cold event in 2010 that caused high python mortality [20]. Adaptations included the maintenance of an active digestive system and changes in gene expression related to regenerative organ growth and behavior [20]. This rapid evolution by natural selection may permit Burmese pythons to expand their range northward into more temperate climates.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, there have been no studies in the last decade examining Burmese python\u2019s potential for northward expansion, despite advances in climate and habitat models, tracking, and a greater understanding of Burmese python cold physiology. What studies do exist were inconclusive and results varied greatly: Rodda et al. (2009) and Pyron et al. (2008) provided oppositional potential range estimates. Rodda et al. (2009) concluded that the potential Burmese python range could include most of the southern U.S., from California through North Carolina. In contrast, Pyron et al. (2008) only included southern Florida and extreme southern Texas as the potential range of Burmese python expansion. Previous studies examining potential Burmese python range primarily agreed with Pyron et al. (2008) and all but two directly refuted the range suggested by Rodda et al. (2009) [19, 23-25]. Furthermore, climate change is projected to decrease the frequency and intensity of cold events in North America, allowing tropical species historically found at or near the equator, such as the Burmese python, to move poleward [26]. A literature review examining potential northward expansion of tropical organisms as a whole, with brief mentions of the Burmese python in Florida, posits that Burmese python range expansion is likely given the evidence for rapid adaptation for cold tolerance presented by Card et al. (2018) [26]. However, a complete understanding of the adaptive capacity of species, ecosystems, and biomes to climate change still remains lacking [26].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to rapid adaptation to cold temperatures, Burmese pythons have shown evidence of hybridizing with another closely related invasive species, the Indian python (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Python molurus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) [27]. Hybridization has increased the population\u2019s genetic diversity and allowed Burmese pythons to mitigate the founding and bottleneck effects \u2014 loss of genetic diversity due to a small founding population size or environmental effects [27]. Additionally, Hunter et al. (2018) found evidence of multiple paternity\u2014the insemination of a female by more than one male during a single reproductive event\u2014in Burmese pythons, also increasing python diversification rate. These behaviors allow for pythons to increase genetic diversity and will likely increase fitness, increasing the probability of northward expansion.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4527 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/03/pic1-300x300.png\" width=\"300\"/><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Burmese Python Presence (1979\u20132016), Conyers &amp; Sen Roy 2021.</span></p>\n<h3 data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"30\"><h4>Disease</h4></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The invasion of the Burmese python in the GEE has introduced at least one pathogen, a lung parasite known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Raillietiella</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">orientalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Lacking coevolution with North American hosts, the spread and severity of this pathogen has increased in native species. This parasite now affects 13 species of native snakes and has extended beyond the python range into north central Alachua County, Florida, approximately 170 miles from the northernmost point of the GEE [28-30]. Researchers observed higher infection intensity, prevalence, and body size of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">R. orientalis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in native snakes than in Burmese pythons, as native snakes do not share evolutionary history with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">R. orientalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and therefore are immunologically naive [29]. Infection by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">R. orientalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> may be lethal or sublethal, and may be the cause of population decline of the pygmy rattlesnake [29, 31]. Additionally, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">R. orientalis\u2019 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">native snake hosts have the highest rate of competence, or are most likely to transmit a resultant infection to a new host or vector after being exposed to a parasite. Furthermore, as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">R. orientalis\u2019 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">native snake hosts are three of the most abundant snakes in North America [29], the parasite has a high likelihood of continued expansion throughout North America and possibly beyond [29]. Since the snakes of North America have not coevolved with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">R.</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">orientalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, infections will be more severe and may cause population wide declines potentially resulting in devastating trophic cascades. The negative effects of the introduced parasite compound with those of Burmese python predation create weakened native populations more susceptible to parasitism, disease, and other stressors. More research is needed to ascertain the complete range of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">R. orientalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, expansion rate, intermediate hosts, sublethal effects on native snakes, and impact on populations.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to introducing a novel pathogen, Burmese pythons are competent hosts of at least one native pathogen and are suspected to be competent hosts of more [28, 32]. As a competent host to native pathogens, the Burmese python likely acts as a reservoir for these pathogens, and increases transmission to native species and humans [28, 32]. However, Burmese pythons are also able to change disease transmission through alteration of host communities via predation. Such is the case with the endemic Everglades Virus (EVEV), which can cause inflammation of the active tissues of the brain, known as clinical encephalitis, in humans. Decreased mammal diversity as a result of Burmese python predation was found to increase blood meals on amplifying hosts\u2014hosts in which infectious agents multiply rapidly to high levels\u2014increasing EVEV infection in mosquitoes [12]. Thus, it is possible that Burmese pythons could increase disease prevalence in humans as well, though contact with infected hosts is required for spread and therefore human disease may be driven by different factors than those in the mosquito-rodent cycle [12]. Understanding of the complex relationship between Burmese python predation on host species while also acting as hosts themselves remains lacking for many other important diseases, and presents an opportunity for future research. Additionally, studies should be conducted to estimate human risk as a result of the Burmese python altering host communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Further disease spillback is mediated by elevated rates of mosquito feedings on Burmese pythons [32]. The mosquitos that prefer feeding on Burmese Pythons also feed on a range of other species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians [32]. Additionally, mosquito ranges extend beyond that of the Burmese python [32]. Thus, through both preferential feeding by mosquitoes on Burmese pythons and large mosquito range, the introduction of the Burmese python into the Everglades has increased disease spread beyond the python range.</span></p>\n<h3 data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"30\"><h4>Predation</h4></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Burmese python has more than 40 prey documented in the Everglades, including a wide range of mammals and birds, and occasionally American alligators [33]. Given their appetite and potentially large population numbers, Burmese pythons are able to exert control over species populations. The decline of particular species relative to others can then cause ecosystem-wide cascades. Pythons have been found to cause severe mammal population declines through predation in their invasive range including 99.3%, 98.9%, and 87.5% decreases in observation frequency of raccoons, opossum, and bobcats respectively [33, 34]. Additionally, pythons have caused a complete local extinction of marsh rabbits, once one of the most commonly seen animals in ENP [33, 35, 36]. When reintroduced to ENP, marsh rabbits were able to establish a breeding population five months after translocation, but by 11 months after reintroduction, 77% of deaths were attributed to Burmese pythons and the population was unable to reestablish [35]. This disproportionate predation makes the reestablishment of this and other similarly affected species impossible as long as the python persists. Similarly, an analysis of anthropogenic stressors and those posed by pythons found that the strongest predictor for marsh rabbit occurrence was distance from the epicenter of python invasion [36]. These results indicate that pythons have profound effects on ecosystem composition through predation and are able to cause trophic cascades, damaging the ecosystem. Additionally, as is the case with Marsh Rabbits, species may be unable to reestablish in the core invasion area, even with translocation efforts. This demonstrates that without removal of Burmese pythons from the GEE, biodiversity and community composition of the GEE may be irreparably damaged.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Large, highly fecund species with wide habitat breaths were found to be the least susceptible to increased pressure from pythons, so the decline of a highly fecund and habitat generalist such as the marsh rabbit is especially concerning [37]. Using trait relationships, researchers predicted exclusively negative responses in occupancy probabilities to the presence of Burmese pythons regarding five unobserved species of concern: the everglades mink, feral hog, gray fox, red fox, and Key Largo woodrat [37]. Though rodent populations were previously thought to be resistant to the effects of pythons, declines in these populations have also been observed, and due to their lack of evolutionary history, one species, the Eastern woodrat, has even been suggested to be attracted to python scent [34, 38]. These results and research conducted on mammal resilience to pythons have shown that there is little evidence of resilience among mammals within the core invasion area, which only further contributes to the homogenization of the ecosystem [34]. Additionally, it is likely that loss of diversity and competition will allow other invasive species to establish more easily [34]. The results show the need for continued monitoring of species to analyze trends, research on response to novel predators, and the mechanisms for negative responses of native species to Burmese pythons. Furthermore, these results suggest that removal or significant population reduction of Burmese pythons may be the only way to curb their negative impacts.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"30\"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The purpose of this review was to examine the effects of the Burmese python in the GEE through predation, introduction and alteration of disease transmission, and potential range expansion. It is evident from this review that the Burmese python, through predation trophic alteration, has had severe effects on the native fauna of the GEE. Ultimately, it is the lack of coevolution between the Burmese python and native fauna that have led to the acute and persistent problems in the GEE. Burmese python establishment in the GEE has proved to be extremely detrimental to an ecosystem already facing considerable anthropogenic stressors. Given this, special attention should be paid to curb further Burmese python expansion to avoid similar ecological catastrophes due to the Burmese python. Further studies should be conducted regarding native resilience and recovery as populations eventually enter the third stage of invasion. Additionally, studies should be conducted to better quantify python density as to frame future understanding of ecosystem dynamics. The Burmese python is a prime example of many regarding invasive species across the globe. So, it is not only critical to better understand these aspects of python success and native fauna response, but the results may be applicable in the broader effort to manage invasive species.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3 data-fontsize=\"20\" data-lineheight=\"30\"><h4>REFERENCES</h4></h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> South Florida Water Management District. 2022.

This paper will analyze the consequences of climate change, specifically temperature changes, within California. Livelihoods of farmers and fishermen, distribution of disease, and fire intensity are examples of how California is affected by this crisis. Climate change in California is especially visible because California dominates the nation\u2019s fruit and nut production, two water-intensive crops. The state\u2019s reliance on large quantities of water to fuel its agricultural system makes it particularly susceptible to drought. Proliferation of detrimental disease vectors, loss of beneficial crops, and elevated levels of dryness imply a complex interaction between California ecosystems and climate change.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Crops</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many farmers and agricultural workers in California impacted by changing climates, as the state is a major agricultural hotspot. Two-thirds of the nation\u2019s fruits and over one-third of the nation\u2019s vegetables are produced in California [1]. Crops such as apricots, peaches, plums, and walnuts are projected to be unable to grow in 90% or more of the Central Valley by the end of the century because of the increase of disease, pests, and weeds that accompany rising temperatures [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1. Projection of crop failure by the end of the century. Heat increases diseases, pests, and weeds. Plum, apricot, peach and walnut crops will be unable to grow in 90% of Central Valley as a result.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Crop yields significantly decrease when heat sensitive plants are not grown in cool enough conditions. Fruits and nuts require chill hours, when the temperature is between 32 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit, to ensure adequate reproduction and development [2]. However, with increasing temperatures, crops are receiving less chill hours during the winter. California grows 98% of the country\u2019s pistachios, but changes in chill hours have affected fertilization [3]. A study found that pistachios need 700 chill hours each winter, yet there have been less than 500 chill hours over the past four years combined [1]. As a result, in 2015, 70% of pistachio shells were missing the kernel (the edible part of the nut) that should have been inside [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Repeated crop failures have also left farmers mentally taxed. Evidence suggests that suicide rates for farmers are already rising in response to farm debt that accumulates in response to poor crop yields [4]. Not only is people\u2019s financial well-being threatened by climate change, but so is their mental health. Mental stress threatens to rise as climates warm around the world, causing economic loss and upheaving agricultural careers.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Crab Fisheries</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Crab fisheries and fishers in California are also negatively impacted by the rise in temperatures. Warming oceans have led to an uncontrollable growth of algal blooms, which contaminates crab meat with domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin that causes seizures and memory loss [5]. The spread of this toxin has forced many fisheries to close. California fishers lost over half the crabs they regularly catch per season, and qualified for more than 25 million dollars of federal disaster relief, during 2015 to 2016 [5]. In response to financial loss, fishers adapted by catching seafood species other than crab, moved to locations where algal blooms have not contaminated their catch, or in the worst case, stopped fishing altogether [5]. California crab fishers\u2019 careers have already been dramatically altered by global warming, and the amount of algal blooms will only continue to increase if warming continues.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Disease</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Temperature plays a major role in the prevalence of infectious diseases because it increases the activity, growth, development, and reproduction of disease vectors, living organisms that carry infectious agents and transmit them to other organisms. It is predicted that warm, humid climates will allow bacteria and viruses, mosquitoes, flies, and rats (all common disease vectors) to thrive [6]. Most animal disease vectors are r-selected, meaning they put little parental investment into individual offspring, but produce many. Warm temperatures allow r-selected species to grow quickly and reproduce often. However, warm temperatures speed up biochemical reactions and are very energy demanding on organism metabolism [7]. In response, disease vector ectotherms, organisms requiring external sources of heat for controlling body temperature, have successfully adapted to changing temperatures. These organisms thermoregulate, or carry out actions that maintain body temperature [7]. Behavioral thermoregulation has shifted the geographical distribution of infectious diseases as disease vectors move to the warm environments that they favor [7].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Initial models about the distribution and prevalence of disease suggested a net increase of the geographical range of diseases, while more recent models suggest a shift in disease distribution [7]. Recent models recognize that vector species have upper and lower temperature limits that affect disease distribution [7]. It is estimated that by 2050, there will be 23 million more cases of malaria at higher latitudes, where previously infections were nonexistent, but 25 million less cases of malaria at lower latitudes, where previously malaria proliferated rapidly through populations, because the conditions necessary for malaria transmission will shift [7].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 2. Shift of malaria disease distribution by 2050. Higher latitudes will have 23 million more cases of malaria while lower latitudes will have 25 million less cases. Although habitat suitability changed, there is little net change in malaria cases.\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cases of Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever), an infectious disease spread from inhaling Coccidioides fungal spores, have recently reached record highs in California [8]. Valley fever is especially prevalent in areas experiencing fluctuating climates, vacillating between extreme drought and high precipitation [8]. After studying 81,000 cases collected over 20 years, researchers identified that major droughts have a causal relationship with increasing Coccidioidomycosis transmission rates [8]. Initially, drought will suppress disease transmission because it prevents proliferation of the Coccidioides fungi. However, transmission rebounds in the years following drought because competing bacteria die off in high heat [8]. Fungi have a number of traits that make them more tolerable to drought compared to bacteria including osmolytes for maintaining cell volume, thick cell walls to mitigate water loss, melanin which aids in thermoregulation, and hyphae that extend throughout the soil to forage for water [9]. Disease spikes are seen after drought, such as the wet season between 2016 and 2017, which had about 2,500 more cases of Valley fever in comparison to the previous year. [8].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The role of rising temperatures in increasing Valley fever cases is evident in Kern County, one of the hottest and driest regions of California. Kern Country has the highest Valley fever incident rates in California; 3,390 cases occurred in a 47-month drought from 2012 to 2016 [8]. Kern County has many cases of Valley fever because of its drought-like conditions. As climate change pushes areas throughout California that are usually cool and wet year-round into alternating dry and wet weather conditions, Valley fever cases are projected to increase.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Fires</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Climate change is also associated with an increase in fire season intensity. The Western United States experienced three years of massive wildfires from 2020 to 2022, with each year burning more than 1.2 million acres [10]. The ongoing drought has led to an accumulation of dry trees, shrubs, and grasses [10]. A 2016 study found that this increase of dry organic plant material has more than doubled the number of large fires in the Western United States since 1984 [10]. One of the ways that dry matter may ignite is by lightning. Projections show that by 2060, there will be a 30% increase of area burned by lightning-ignited wildfires compared to 2011 [10].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Residents in California are in danger of losing their lives and property to fire damage. A single fire can lead to massive destruction. In 2018, the Woolsey Fire burned 96,949 acres and hundreds of homes, and killed three people [11]. Over one million buildings in California are within high-risk fire zones, and this number is projected to increase as temperatures continue to rise [10]. With the amount of dry organic matter increasing and wildfire incidence surging, there will be more cases of property damage and loss of life in California. High temperatures and extreme weather events make it more likely that people will fall victim to these life-threatening disasters.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Increases in global temperature have a negative effect on human physical health and mental wellbeing. Climate change is making it more difficult to secure a livelihood, changing the spread of disease, and destroying lives and property. However, projections about rising temperatures allow farmers the chance to make informed decisions about which crops to grow, fishermen to relocate to areas that are less impacted by algal blooms, health experts to predict when and where outbreaks of certain diseases might occur, and fire protection services to increase their presence in high-risk areas. Projections help people predict where and when a climate change associated event is likely to occur, so that they may hopefully respond quicker and more efficiently.

Yet as decades roll by, Western Sandpiper populations have been in continuous decline, and the rugged coastline of the Pacific Northwest seems lonelier than ever</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [1]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. As a migratory bird species, the Western Sandpiper plays crucial ecological roles as an indicator of ecosystem health and by connecting diverse habitats across continents.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The purpose of this essay is to introduce the ongoing decline of Western Sandpiper populations in recent years, with a particular focus on the population decline in North America. This paper will provide an overview of Western Sandpiper migration and population changes, examine the potential causes behind the dynamics, and analyze the decline\u2019s corresponding ecological effects. I will also explore possible remedies for the issue from the perspectives of habitat restoration, conservation, and legislative measures. The ultimate objective of this essay is to raise awareness and promote action for the ecological conservation of Western Sandpipers before it is too late.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Background</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Western Sandpipers are small migratory birds that breed in high Arctic regions of Alaska and Siberia and migrate south to the Pacific coast of North and South America for winter. Their migration is 15,000 kilometers every year along the Pacific Flyway, spanning from Alaska to South America. During winter, their nonbreeding season, they move to coastal areas with mudflats, estuaries, and beaches, which allows the birds to rest and forage for food. In spring, the Western Sandpipers take a similar reverse migration route, stopping at critical habitats along the way until they reach the treeless Arctic tundra. As they fly north, they breed in Northwestern Alaska and Eastern Siberia, and each female lays three to four eggs.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They measure 6 to 7 inches in length and have reddish brown-gold markings on their head and wings. Their most salient features are their slender pointed bills and long legs. The bills are adapted for foraging crustaceans, insects, and mollusks in muddy areas, while their pair of long but thin legs are used for wading in shallow water and sand. These small, darting birds can be seen in tidal areas, foraging in mudflats for invertebrates and biofilms at low and middle tides with other shorebird communities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having multiple species foraging together makes shorebirds among the most difficult birds to identify, especially with many species being quite similar in morphology as well as call. As they always smoothly blend into the community, it is not surprising that the population decline of the small Western Sandpipers went unnoticed at first and was reported only when changes in population levels became more obvious.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Causes of Western Sandpiper population decline</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The population decline in the Western Sandpiper population has been continuous throughout the past decade. According to the North American Breeding Bird Survey, which monitors populations of breeding birds across the continent, the Western Sandpiper had a relatively stable population trend in the United States from 1966 to 2015, with an annual population decline of 0.1% over this period </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[2]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In more recent years, a research team in British Columbia, Canada that investigates estuary condition change has noticed the decline in Western Sandpipers inhabiting the Fraser River estuary. Observing the Western Sandpiper population during Northern migration on the Fraser River estuary, the team concluded a 54% decline in Western Sandpipers over the entire study period of 2019 []. The negative trend in migrating Western Sandpipers in North America is consistent with this study in Fraser River. A study using Geolocator wetness data to detect periods of migratory flight examined the status and trends of 45 shorebird species in North America, including the Western sandpiper. The author found that the Western Sandpiper population in the U.S. declined by 37% from 1974 to 2014, with an estimated population of 2,450,000 individuals in 2014 compared to 3,900,000 individuals in 1974.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[3]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, on BirdLife International Data Zone, Western Sandpipers have been labeled \u201cleast concern\u201d for their wide range of inhabitation, but their population is decreasing. The species faces threats from habitat loss and degradation, pollution, and disturbance, particularly in its wintering and stopover sites along the North American Pacific coast. Habitat loss due to human activities, namely agricultural expansion and oil development, has contributed to the loss and degradation of Western Sandpiper\u2019s breeding, wintering, and stopover habitats. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[4]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The loss of these habitats has led to reductions in breeding success, migration stopover times, and overwintering survival of Western Sandpipers. Meanwhile, Western Sandpipers are constantly exposed to various pollutants including pesticides, heavy metals, oil spills, and plastics. These contaminants affect Western Sandpiper\u2019s health and reproductive success directly and impact Western Sandpiper\u2019s prey and predators. As habitat loss leads to reduced food resources, Western Sandpipers\u2019 overall health is negatively impacted, making them even more vulnerable to pollutants and contaminants.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Climate change is also expected to have future impacts on the species. One possible shift that climate change can impose is on the timing, intensity, and distribution of precipitation. The precipitation shifts have caused droughts and floods in areas that are breeding and stopover habitats for Western Sandpiper and other shorebirds, leading to reduced breeding success and increased mortality in the Western Sandpiper population. Climate change also imposes effects on sea level, temperature, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather, which can all affect the quality of breeding habitat and food availability for Western Sandpipers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The interactions between these factors are complex and can lead to a feedback loop of negative impacts on the population. As habitat loss leads to reduced food resources, Western Sandpipers\u2019 overall health is negatively impacted, making them even more vulnerable to pollutants and contaminants.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Effects of Western Sandpiper population decline</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The decline of the Western Sandpiper population can have significant impacts on ecosystems. As a migratory shorebird, the Western Sandpiper\u2019s ecological role lies in coastal environments; by preying on invertebrates along the coastal shoreline, the Western Sandpipers control their prey species populations and balance the ecosystem. The decline of the Western Sandpiper population can lead to an increase in their prey species such as polychaete worms and bivalves, which can lead to changes in the composition of other species that prey on similar invertebrates and perturbates the ecosystem\u2019s equilibrium. Furthermore, many predator species, such as falcons and owls, depend on the Western Sandpiper as a food source, and their decline will negatively impact these predator species.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aside from predator-prey dynamics, Western Sandpipers also forage with many other migratory shorebird species in muddy areas along the coast. These birds, such as the Marble Godwit and the Red Knot, depend on the same stopover habitats as the Western Sandpiper during their own migrations and thus compete for similar resources. As the Western Sandpiper population declines, changing interspecies dynamics will shift the survival and reproductive success of other species, disturbing the equilibrium of the stopover ecosystems.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Western Sandpipers are a popular bird species among birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts, and their migration stopover sites in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska have an important role in ecotourism and its respective economic and cultural values. The economic impact of Western Sandpiper ecotourism in the Copper River Delta, Alaska was evaluated to produce over $1.5 million in revenue and 100 jobs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[5]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overall, the decline of the Western Sandpiper population can have a complex and far-reaching impact on both the ecosystem and human society. By interacting with native species and migratory species in their natural habitats, the Western Sandpiper\u2019s role deeply interweaves within the ecosystem.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conservation efforts and solutions</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conservation efforts to protect and restore Western Sandpiper populations are critical in maintaining ecosystem health. One of the main strategies to protect the Western Sandpiper is to conserve their stopover sites and breeding grounds by monitoring and researching invasive species and coastal development. Aside from consistent restoration of degraded habits after human disturbance, prevention of further human development in Western Sandpiper habitats is also critical in maintaining the habitat\u2019s health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Educating the public about the importance of Western Sandpipers and their habitats is a crucial aspect in raising awareness and gaining support for conservation efforts. Outreach such as public lectures, bird festivals, and school tours are great opportunities to connect humans to the beautiful avian community and improve public consciousness regarding ecosystem conservation. An example includes the Monterey Bay Birding Festival, which is an annual festival in California during shorebird fall migration season. This festival promotes awareness of shorebirds with its educational workshops and bird tours.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[6]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, conservation efforts of shorebird populations face limitations in funding and coordination. Significant funding efforts are required to restore what has been lost, but limited budgets restrict the scope and effectiveness of conservation approaches. In addition, since conservation efforts are implemented on a site-by-site basis, there is a need for improved coordination among different agencies to solve problems together. Potential solutions to the need for adequate funding and coordination are the implementation of stronger policies of avian conservation and habitat conservation as well as the encouragement of sustainable tourism and outreach efforts.</span></p>\n<p><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Western Sandpiper population in North American tidal areas has been experiencing a significant decline in recent years, largely due to human activities and subsequent climate change. Population changes of this small, long-legged shorebird affect many species that interact and co-exist with them in the coastal ecosystem. They are one of the most abundant shorebird species in North America and play a vital part in the ecological and cultural values along the coast. Population dynamics vary year to year and between different populations, and increasing efforts in the monitoring and conservation of the Western Sandpiper community and their respective habitats is essential to ensuring the species\u2019 survival. We need to investigate the causes behind the population\u2019s decline in recent years and take action before the negative effects have gone too far and these ballerinas of the beach are unable to recover.</span></p>\n<p><h4>REFERENCES</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[1] Andres, B., Smith, B.

In pursuit of this goal, I signed up as an intern with Daniel Karp\u2019s agroecology lab in my freshman year and stayed with them for my entire undergrad. During this internship, I worked alongside several Ph.D. students, such as Katherine Lauck and Cody Pham, who research the cumulative effects of land conversion and climate change on native avifauna at Putah Creek. I was so inspired by their work that I decided to conduct an independent project investigating similar phenomena. Specifically, I was curious about how birds respond to temperature across multiple landscapes, and how this pattern of behavior might influence their choice of habitat. While reading this paper, I would like you to consider the broader implications of the findings as they pertain to species conservation in the context of climate change.</span></i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Increasing frequency and severity of temperature spikes caused by climate change will disproportionately impact heat-sensitive species. However, certain types of vegetation may protect animals from temperature spikes. Heat-sensitive species can retreat to shaded microhabitats when temperature increases, allowing them to avoid detrimental effects on fitness. Here, we examined habitat selection and behavioral responses to temperature of Western Bluebirds (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Siailia mexicana</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) and Northern Mockingbirds (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mimus polyglottos</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). We conducted transect surveys and collected behavioral data on bird movement for two months in riparian forest and perennial cropland in the Central Valley of California, where breeding season temperatures are often above 35\u00b0C. Bluebirds were observed more frequently in shaded riparian forest, while mockingbirds were observed more frequently in exposed agricultural fields. Correspondingly, bluebirds became less active at higher temperatures, while mockingbirds exhibited no response. Together, our results imply that heat-sensitive species may be more likely to select natural or semi-natural habitats and change their behaviors when temperatures spike. The results of this study imply that the combined effects of anthropogenic land development and climate change may be more destructive for heat-sensitive species than for heat-tolerant species.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of temperature spikes across the world [1]. Many species will likely experience increased mortality due to these extreme conditions [2\u20134], with heat-sensitive species experiencing especially detrimental effects [5,6]. However, thermally-buffered habitats could mitigate the impact of heat spikes on organisms, as certain habitat features, like vegetative cover, have been shown to cool local temperatures through shading and evapotranspiration [7,8]. Landscapes with high amounts of thermally-buffered habitats, such as closed-canopy forests, have been shown to have less dramatic temperature extremes than open habitats [9,10]. Furthermore, it has been shown that animals in these thermally-buffered habitats are less likely to be impacted by rising global temperatures [11,12]. As such, organisms that are sensitive to temperature extremes may preferentially select for these habitats, and therefore may be able to avoid potentially lethal effects. Birds have been observed to retreat to shaded habitats when temperatures spike [13]. However, it is unclear whether heat-sensitive species specifically select for thermally-buffered habitats, or if heat-tolerant species persist in non-buffered habitats. Therefore, we sought to understand how the habitat selection of bird species may be associated with their behavioral responses to temperature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bird populations in North America are in rapid decline [14], and are predicted to continue declining with climate change [15]. As such, determining the habitat requirements of birds in response to increasingly extreme temperatures could be crucial to their conservation. We conducted behavioral surveys of birds in the Central Valley of California to address two questions: 1) does habitat selection differ between Western Bluebirds and Northern Mockingbirds, and 2) are behavioral responses to temperature different between these species? We hypothesized that birds species which exhibit significantly different behavior during high temperature will preferentially select habitats with more vegetation cover.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><h4>Methods</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Experimental design</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We selected two sites along Putah Creek in the Central Valley of California. In this system, temperatures often reach 35\u00b0C during the hottest months of the year. These sites contain a combination of riparian (forest existing along a river bank) and agricultural land and are approximately five miles apart from each other. At each site, the two focal land cover types\u2013riparian forest and perennial agriculture\u2013were present within one half-mile of each other (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). We obtained observations along four 100 meter (m) transects. In the riparian areas, we placed transects along regions of the sites where vegetation was sparse enough that birds could be observed, as dense vegetation made it difficult to track the individual birds. In the agricultural areas, we placed transects along areas that were close enough to the crops that birds could be spotted. Transects were placed approximately 50 meters apart from each other.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We focused on Western Bluebirds (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Siailia mexicana</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) and Northern Mockingbirds (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mimus polyglottos</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) due to their high abundance at Putah Creek. Additionally, we chose these species because they forage on the ground rather than in the air, and therefore were easier to observe with the naked eye.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1. </span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our two study sites were in close proximity to both riparian and agricultural habitats along Putah Creek. At each site, we observed birds along a total of 16 transects (depicted in red).</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Data collection</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We conducted our surveys from late April to early July 2022, the height of the breeding season for our study species. We visited each site at least once a week, in either the morning or early afternoon. During each visit, I would walk along the transects. Once a bird of either target species was spotted, I would track the bird for two minutes and record all behaviors displayed, along with the amount of time spent engaging in each behavior. These behaviors included \u201cforaging\u201d (searching for, chasing, or eating an insect), \u201cmoving\u201d (locomotion with wings or legs), \u201cresting\u201d (standing or sitting motionless), \u201csinging\u201d (repetitive vocalization for more than three seconds), \u201cpreening\u201d (use of beak to position feathers), and \u201cdisputing\u201d (fighting between birds that occurs due to territorial disputes). I recorded temperature and wind speed each hour using a Kestrel 2000 Weather Meter.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Data analysis</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We ran Fisher\u2019s exact tests to determine if mockingbirds and bluebirds preferentially selected different landscape types across sites. The variables in this model included \u2018species,\u2019 and \u2018landscape type,\u2019 which was defined as either \u201cAgriculture\u201d or \u201cRiparian.\u201d We ran the model across both sites and did not distinguish between the two separate sites depicted in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Then, we implemented multiple linear regression models examining the relationship between the time spent engaging in various behaviors and temperature for each species. We considered the time spent engaged in a particular behavior to be the percentage of time during the two-minute observation period in which the individual bird exhibited that behavior (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">i.e.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, time spent moving, foraging, resting, preening, singing, or disputing).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To account for the effects of spatial autocorrelation (or the tendency of areas which are close together to provide similar data values), we first included a site covariate in our models. We additionally attempted to control for the effects of a natural circadian rhythm on behavior by including a time-of-day covariate. As temperature and time were highly correlated (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">r</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 0.696 for bluebird observations and 0.548 for mockingbird observations), we included these covariates using a temperature residual approach. Specifically, we regressed time against temperature and obtained residual values, representing whether temperatures were hotter or cooler than the average expected temperature at any given time of day. We then ran a multiple linear regression including the effects of temperature residuals, time of day, and site on bird behavior.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><h4>Results</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Landscape preference</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bluebirds and mockingbirds exhibited significantly different habitat preferences. Bluebirds preferentially resided in riparian areas, whereas mockingbirds preferentially resided in agricultural landscapes across both sites (Fisher\u2019s exact test, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">p</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 4.583E-15; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 2. Mockingbirds (n=34) are observed to reside in agricultural landscapes more frequently than riparian landscapes. Bluebirds are observed to reside in riparian landscapes more frequently than agricultural landscapes (n=35).</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Changes in patterns of behavior</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We found that temperature negatively affected the amount of time that bluebirds spent moving (Linear regression, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">p</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 0.0077, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">F</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 8.069, df = 1, 33;</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Figure 3; Supp. 1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). However, temperature did not significantly affect mockingbird movement (Linear regression, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">p</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 0.297, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">F</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 1.125, df = 1, 32; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 3; Supp. 1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Results were broadly similar after including \u2018site\u2019 as another effect in the model to account for multiple observations at the same location. Specifically, temperature still did not affect mockingbird movement </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Multiple regression, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">p</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 0.635, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">F</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 0.577, df = 3, 30; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Supp. 3</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and marginally affected bluebird movement </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Multiple regression, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">p</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 0.0682, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">F</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 2.622, df = 3, 31; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Supp. 3</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. However, one of the sites had very few bluebird observations (n=4); when this site was removed from the model, temperature again negatively affected bluebird movement </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(Linear regression, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">p</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 0.0123, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">F</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> = 7.138, df = 1, 29; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Supp. 2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The last model we ran tested the effects of both temperature residuals and time of day on bird behavior. Using these models, temperature again did not have a significant effect on the behavior of mockingbirds but did have a marginal effect on bluebird movement (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">p </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">= 0.07; </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Supp. 4</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For all of the models, resting, foraging, disputing, singing, and preening of bluebirds and mockingbirds exhibited no significant association with any environmental variable (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Supp. 1, Supp. 2, Supp. 3, Supp. 4</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 3. Bluebirds (left) are observed to reduce the percentage of time they spend moving as temperature increases. Mockingbird movement (right) did not significantly decline with rising temperature. The black points represent individual bird observations, the solid lines represent the linear model predictions, and the gray bands represent the 95% confidence intervals.</span></i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><h4>Discussion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our results suggest that bluebirds select for shaded riparian habitats, while mockingbirds select for exposed agricultural habitats. Correspondingly, the temperature-altered patterns of movement in bluebirds suggest that they are sensitive to heat and may potentially select for thermally-buffered habitats as a result. In contrast, a lack of observed heat sensitivity in mockingbirds suggests that persistence in open habitats could in part be driven by thermal tolerance. While more data are required to make definitive conclusions, considering only patterns at our site with sufficient data, we found significant evidence for temperature-altered patterns of movement. Together, these results suggest that temperature sensitivity could drive patterns of habitat selection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Previous research also suggests that habitats with low vegetative cover (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">i.e.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, without thermally-buffered microclimates) are likely to contain heat-tolerant species [16,17]. For example, Wilson </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 2007 demonstrated that populations of leaf-cutter ants (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Atta sexdens</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> residing in cities took 20% longer to succumb to high temperatures than ants dwelling in rural areas. In Brans </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 2017, it was observed that water fleas (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Daphnia magna</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) from urban areas were more tolerant to high temperatures than rural populations, partially because they had smaller body sizes. Both studies imply that organisms must have high heat tolerance to live in habitats with low vegetative cover. This is similar to our finding that mockingbirds, a heat-tolerant species, were more likely to reside in unvegetated agricultural landscapes than were bluebirds, a heat-sensitive species. However, while the previous studies provide evidence that organisms become heat-tolerant in these landscapes due to natural selection, our findings suggest that behavioral differences between heat-tolerant species and heat-sensitive species may also cause unvegetated landscapes to become dominated by heat-tolerant species.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, we demonstrate that riparian and other thermally-buffered habitats could be crucial to the persistence of heat-sensitive species. Other studies have shown that vertebrates are more likely to exhibit heat-related mortality in habitats with low vegetation cover [12,18]. For example, Zuckerberg </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 2018 demonstrated that avian survival in small grassland patches was negatively associated with temperature, while survival in large grassland patches was not. Additionally, Lauck </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2023 showed that temperature spikes are associated with a decline in bird reproduction across the continental United States for organisms living in agricultural areas, but not for organisms living in forests. These results suggest that vegetation protects vertebrates from heat stress. Although the mechanisms of this protection are not clear, one potential explanation is that vegetation provides shaded areas that animals can use as refuges to avoid lethal temperatures [7]. Additionally, it has been shown that plants regulate local temperatures through evapotranspirative cooling [8], potentially playing a role in protecting vertebrates from heat spikes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One caveat of our study is that bluebird responses were only marginally significant under multiple regression models that included time of day as a covariate. Associations between bird behavior and time could either be due to circadian rhythms or temperature shifts; it is difficult to statistically disentangle the effects of temperature and time of day. However, the significant results from the models including only temperature imply that bluebirds do indeed alter their behavior in response to environmental factors that likely include temperature.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our findings provide preliminary evidence that Western Bluebirds are temperature-sensitive and preferentially select vegetated habitats, while Northern Mockingbirds do not preferentially select vegetated habitats. To obtain enough data to provide definitive evidence of these patterns, the methods could be repeated for several more years and across more sites. Nonetheless, the results from this study suggest that anthropogenic land development will be more destructive for heat-sensitive species than for heat-resistant species. As such, we suggest incorporating thermally-buffered habitats such as groups of trees or hedgerows in working landscapes to mitigate the negative impacts of anthropogenic land development on heat-sensitive organisms.</span></p>\n</div>"
