That class discussed some relationships between microbes and between human beings. One of the points that stuck in my mind was the relationship of microbes between humans and one of our favorite pets, dogs. By researching this topic, I found it so astounding that I decided to write about it. I hope this piece will be interesting not only for science-lovers but also for the general public.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Both, inside and out, our bodies harbor a huge array of microorganisms. These microorganisms are a diverse group of generally minute life forms, which are called microbiota when they are found within a specific environment. Microbiota can refer to all the microorganisms found in an environment including bacteria, viruses, archaea, protozoa, and fungi. Furthermore, the collection of genomes from all the microorganisms found in a particular environment is referred to as a microbiome. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), this plethora of microbes contribute more genes responsible for human survival than humans contribute.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Researchers also estimated that the human microbiome consisted of 360 times more bacterial genes than human genes. Their results show that this contribution by microbes is critical for human survival. For instance, in the gastrointestinal tract bacterial genes are present, which allow humans to digest and absorb nutrients that otherwise would be unavailable. In addition to this, microbes also assist in the synthesis of many beneficial compounds, like vitamins and anti-inflammatory agents which our genome cannot produce. (4)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where does this mini-ecosystem start from? The microbiome comes in our body as soon as we come out from the mother\u2019s womb, we acquire them from the mother\u2019s vagina and then, later on, by breastfeeding which plays a great role in making the microbes\u2019 own unique community. There are several factors that influence the microbiome which include physiology, food, lifestyle, age, and environment. These are not only present in humans, but also in most animals and play a significant role in their health. For instance, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">gastrointestinal </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">microorganisms</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> exist in symbiotic associations with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">animals</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Microorganisms</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in the gut assist in the digestion of feedstuffs, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">help</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> protect the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">animal</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> from infections, and some </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">microbes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> even synthesize and provide essential nutrients to their </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">animal</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> host.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This gives us an idea of how important these microorganisms are to our living system as a whole.(3)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Besides the human\u2019s strong emotional connection with the dogs, there is also a biological relationship between the human and dog\u2019s interactions. In context of this interesting relationship, research has been conducted. Computational biologist Luis Pedro Coelho and his colleagues at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, in collaboration with Nestl\u00e9 Research, studied the gut microbiome (the genetic material belonging to the microbiota) of beagles and retrievers. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They found that the gene content of the dog\u2019s microbiome showed more similarities to the human gut microbiome than to the microbiomes of pig or mice.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> When researchers mapped the gene content of the dog, mouse and pig microbiome in contrast to the human gut genes, they found that respectively 63%, 20% and 33% overlapped.(5) This shows the extensive similarities between human and dog\u2019s gut microbiomes in comparison to other animals. Speaking on the discovery, Luis Pedro Coelho says: \u201cWe found many similarities between the gene content of the human and dog gut microbiome. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The results of this comparison suggest that we are more similar to man\u2019s best friend than we originally thought.\u201d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (1)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The University of Colorado Boulder did a study on the types of microbes present on the different parts of humans, to better understand the diversity and its significance for the human\u2019s body. They conducted the study on 60 American families in which they sampled 159 people and 36 dogs. The team took samples from tongue, forehead, right and left palm and fecal samples to detect individual microbial communities. Through research, the researcher learned that people who own dogs are much more likely to share the same kinds of these \u201cgood\u201d bacteria with their dogs. They have also learned that children who are raised with dogs are less likely than others to develop a range of immune-related disorders, including asthma and allergies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOne of the biggest surprises was that we could detect such a strong connection between their owners and pets,\u201d said Knight, a faculty member at CU-Boulder\u2019s BioFrontiers Institute.(6) The results found that adults</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> who have a dog and they live together, share the greatest number of skin phylotypes while adults who neither have a dog nor live together share the least.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The University of Arizona is also conducting another research study, with some other universities including UC San Diego, in which they are seeking healthy people from Arizona age 50 or older, who have not lived with dogs for at least the past 6 months. Then they are selecting persons who would like to live with the assigned dogs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The goal of the study is to see whether the dogs enhance the health of older people and work as probiotics (good bacteria).</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> But this research is ongoing and the outcomes are not yet released. Rob Knight, Professor of Pediatrics and Computer Science &amp; Engineering at UC San Diego and his lab studied microbiomes. Knight and his team found that the microbial community on adult skin are on average more similar to those of their own dogs than to others. They also found that cohabiting couples share more microbes with one another if they have a dog, compared with couples who don\u2019t have a dog. Their research suggests that a dog\u2019s owner can be identified just by analyzing the microbial diversity of the dog and its human, as they share microbiomes. These studies are finding a critical relationship that is very helpful in microbiology and the overall health field in science. (2)\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These studies reveal the various interesting relationships of microbiomes with us and other living beings. So far, the studies discussed how dog\u2019s microbiomes are shared by the owner and how gene sequencing helps us to understand these connections. The growing understanding of this connection with microorganisms raises many other outstanding questions like what are the health benefits of a dog to a human? How can they help in preventing certain chronic diseases? This represents an exciting challenge for scientists and researchers to refine their understanding of microbiomes and find answers to these further emerging questions.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Work Cited</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cNIH Human Microbiome project defines normal bacterial makeup of the body\u201d. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> www.nih.gov.

I came across this study that examined the role of gut microbiota in brain function and mood regulation. With the globally rising prevalence of depression, this study provides some potential insight into the development of the disorder on a physiological level and provides a novel approach to anti-depression therapeutics.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afflicting nearly 350 million individuals annually, depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite the widespread effort to uncover the environmental and genetic basis of the disorder, the pathophysiology of depression remains elusive. This is attributed to the fact that, similar to other mental disorders, depression is the result of a complex interplay between several biological and societal factors [1]. Several studies have found that the pathology of depression is influenced by dysfunction in neuromodulatory systems, such as the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is composed of endocannabinoids (eCB), lipid-based neurotransmitters that regulate mood, emotions, and stress responses [2,3]. Another physiological factor that contributes to depression is the impairment of the hippocampal region of the brain, specifically hippocampal impaired neurogenesis, which contributes to depressive-like behaviors in rodents [4]. This is due to the fact that adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been shown to help mediate stress responses and depressive behavior. The dysfunction of these critical processes has recently been investigated in relation to symbiotic microbiota.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It has been well established that the diversity of intestinal microbiota contributes to enhanced host function (particularly in immunity, metabolism, and the central nervous system) allowing an individual to better combat disease and regulate metabolic function [5,6,7]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Previous studies have demonstrated that dysbiosis, or altered intestinal microbial composition, has been found in depressed patients when compared to healthy controls</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [8].\u00a0 It has also been observed that microbiota modulate anxiety symptoms in mice via the release of bacterial metabolites that may affect critical pathways in the brain [9]. Finally, colitis, a digestive disease characterized by inflammation in the colon, is influenced by gut microbiota and is commonly observed in depression patients [10]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overall, these studies imply a potential association between intestinal microbial composition and depressive-like behaviors</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The following study aims to examine the direct effect of gut microbiota on depressive behaviors in mice, allowing for a broader understanding of the physiological basis of depression and provide new avenues for therapeutics and potential treatment [11].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers used unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS), a mouse model of stress-induced depression. To simulate stress, mice in the UCMS group were exposed to various stressors including cage tilting, altered cage bedding, foreign odor, and altered light/dark cycle. The mice in the UCMS group were exposed to two stressors a day for eight weeks. As expected, UCMS mice exhibited depressive-like behaviors such as decreased feeding and self-grooming behavior, consistent with apathetic behavior in those diagnosed with depression. UCMS mice also exhibited reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, confirming a previous study by Snyder et al. that noted this observation in rodents with depression [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once depressive-like behaviors were established in UCMS mice, researchers conducted a fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from mice exposed to stressors to mice that have not been exposed to any stressors. FMT\u2019s are an innovative form of treatment in which a stool sample is collected from one individual and transplanted in the colon of another individual. This can be administered in various ways, such as a colonoscopy, oral capsules, or via a tube that stretches from the nose into the stomach or bowel [12]. In this study, mice received transplants via an oral gavage which involves the passage of a feeding needle down the esophagus. The purpose of an FMT is to populate the recipient intestine with diverse microorganisms that preferentially provide some benefit to the host. When the microbiota from the UCMS mice was transplanted into the healthy mice, the healthy mice exhibited decreased hippocampal neurogenesis and mimicked the depressive-like behaviors exhibited in the UCMS mice, although the healthy mice had not been exposed to any stressors.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The effect of the FMT on recipient mice illustrated the influence of intestinal microbial composition on the host. Researchers in this study hypothesized that this was due to alterations in the host\u2019s metabolism. To investigate this further, the concentration of multiple small molecule metabolites in bodily fluids was measured. This revealed a significant decrease in levels of several short-chain fatty acids which may have resulted from dysbiosis-induced changes. As fat is primarily broken down in the small intestine via chemical and mechanical processes, an altered microbial composition in the intestinal tract would unsurprisingly influence fat breakdown. More specifically, there was a decrease in the concentration of an eCB precursor, fatty acids containing </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">arachidonic acid (AA), in recipient mice. As dysregulation of the ECS has been studied in association with depression, this finding in recipient mice aligns with the typical model of depression. To further understand the role of impaired eCB signaling in the recipient mice, researchers observed whether enhancing eCB signaling via dietary supplementation could alleviate the depressive-like behaviors observed in the recipient mice. It was found that recipient mice that were orally administered AA had reversed the depressive-like behaviors indeed by UCMS microbiota. Additionally, AA supplementation aided hippocampal neurogenesis.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To determine how UCMS microbiota affected the microbial composition of recipient mice, fecal microbiota from UCMS mice was sequenced using 16s rRNA. As 16s rRNA is present in all bacteria, the 16s rRNA gene is highly conserved and therefore, a useful tool to identify microbes within complex biological mixtures. The analysis revealed increased levels of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ruminoccacaae </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Porphyromonodaceae </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and a decrease in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lactobacillacae</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This finding supports previous studies that report an association between decreased </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lactobacillacae </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and stress in mice. The differences in the microbial composition of recipient mice and donor UCMS mice were maintained eight weeks after transplantation. To test the influence of decreased </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lactobacillacae </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in recipient mice, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lactobacillacae </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">was orally administered similarly to AA supplantation. Dietary complementation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lactobacillacae</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> had a similar effect as AA supplantation, where depressive-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis were reversed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Using mice, researchers discovered that the onset of depressive-like behaviors is triggered by a reduction in lipid metabolites. These lipid metabolites, more specifically endocannabinoids, bind to receptors in regions of the brain that control emotion and memory. Surprisingly, the concentrations of endocannabinoids are biochemically influenced by the gut microbiota. Although the mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be understood, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">these studies have elucidated the impact of gut microbiota beyond digestive function, revealing the extensive scope of microbial composition on healthy host function</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This study specifically illustrates the importance of balanced gut microbiota for healthy neural and metabolic function and supports the potential use of dietary or probiotic supplementation as a treatment option for those diagnosed with depression. However, it is important to note that this area of research is relatively new and further studies are required to determine the translational capacity of studies related to the gut-brain axis from mice to humans. With consideration of the limitations of this study, this finding does still provide an intriguing avenue of treatment for mood disorders by introducing a novel physiological approach to mediate depressive-like symptoms.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Limbana, T., Khan, F., &amp; Eskander, N.

For decades, scientists have researched these microorganisms and their role in dental diseases.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But far less is known about the interactions of these bacteria and their products with other parts of the body, and these interactions could hold a particularly important role in human health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe\u2019ve always thought of the mouth as somehow in isolation, that oral health does not somehow impact the rest of the body,\u201d said Purnima Kumar, DDS, MS, PhD, professor of periodontology at Ohio State University, during a session at the American Association for the Advancement of Science </span><a href=\"https://meetings.aaas.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">annual meeting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that took place on February 8 [2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scientists, though, are increasingly looking to the </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503789/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">oral microbiome</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for answers to questions about health and disease [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe time is absolutely right for us to start putting the mouth back into the body,\u201d Kumar said during the session \u201cKiller Smile: The Link Between the Oral Microbiome and Systemic Disease.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Panelists highlighted three systemic diseases \u2014 </span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31850631/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">diabetes mellitus</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019644/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rheumatoid arthritis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and </span><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/2/495/htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alzheimer\u2019s disease</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u2014 and their unexpected connection to disturbances in the oral microbiome [4-6]. A common thread running through all three diseases is an association with </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3590713/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">periodontitis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a gum disease triggered by the accumulation of bacteria, viruses, and even fungi in dental biofilm, or plaque, on the surface of teeth [7].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In health, there is peace between oral microbes and our immune system. Healthy and frequent communication \u2014 molecular diplomacy between bacteria and immune surveillance \u2014 maintains stable relations. But microbial imbalances due to bacterial buildup in plaque can cause inflammatory immune reactions, resulting in the gradual breakdown of the barrier between biofilm and gum tissue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhen you have gum disease, that crosstalk, that communication, that harmony is broken down,\u201d Kumar said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When bacteria subsequently </span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32385883/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">invade</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> our gum tissues, there are consequences for human disease [8].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mark Ryder, DMD, professor of periodontology at University of California, San Francisco, </span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32533852/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the role of one such bacterium, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Porphyromonas gingivalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, in disease [9]. This bacterium</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">secretes enzymes called gingipains, which are essential for its survival.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the case of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, these gingipains can travel through the bloodstream, cross the blood-brain barrier, and accumulate in brain regions like the hippocampus, which is involved in memory. There, they help break down an embedded membrane protein called amyloid precursor protein into fragments, which group together in deposits found in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Further study of gingipains and other microbial products could provide insight into a \u201ccritical early event in the initiation and progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Ryder said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similarly, </span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29513935/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rheumatoid arthritis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> can be triggered by immune responses to other by-products of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">P. gingivalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, including protein antibodies that cause joint inflammation, according to Iain Chapple, BDS, PhD, professor of periodontology at the University of Birmingham [5].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Past research on links between the oral microbiome and systemic disease has even shown that these effects can travel a two-way street.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is apparent in the research of Dana Graves, DDS, DMSc, professor of periodontics at University of Pennsylvania, whose </span><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31850631/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">work</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has examined the effects of diabetes on our microbiome, and vice versa [4].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cDiabetes impacts the mouth in a very profound way,\u201d said Graves, adding that the inflammatory responses to bacteria caused by diabetes lead to disruption of the microbiome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThis bidirectionality is something we saw first with diabetes, we\u2019ve seen it now with rheumatoid arthritis, and it appears now that we\u2019re starting to see it with chronic kidney disease,\u201d Chapple said. \u201cWe need to start really digging down into [biological mechanisms] to understand more about that relationship.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, the verdict is still out on how much bacterial products such as gingipains contribute to disease. For Ryder and others, the existing data is insufficient \u2014 fully answering that question depends on carefully constructed clinical trials.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhen we\u2019re trying to establish a link between something like the microbiome and the mouth and Alzheimer\u2019s, association studies are important, the actual underlying biological mechanisms are important, but finally what sort of seals the deal, of course, is the actual effects of intervention,\u201d Ryder said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An ongoing </span><a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03823404\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">clinical trial</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with more than 600 patients is evaluating the success of gingipain inhibitors in preventing symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [10]. The results, expected by the end of this year, could carry implications not just for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease but any disease with underlying roots in the oral microbiome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Regardless of the results, it\u2019s clear that breaking out the toothbrush and floss every day is crucial to our overall well-being.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ursell LK, Metcalf JL, Parfrey LW, Knight R. 2012.

I recently stumbled upon the term \u201cgut-brain axis\u201d and was in awe as to how this connection between our gut microbes and our brain even exists, and learned that gut microbiome diversity is implicated in a plethora of mental disorders, from depression and anxiety, to autism. I decided to write this review to share my learning of how the gut microbiome can change the brain and potentially contribute to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), because I feel as if this is not a widely known correlation \u2013 even as a physiology major, I never learned about the gut-brain axis in my courses. Moreover, the cause of autism is still widely undefined and the gut microbiome may provide a possible explanation for ASD onset in some individuals. I believe a wide range of students will find this upcoming research interesting, but my intended audience is those who research autism or work with autistic individuals, as it may provide an explanation for ASD and seems to be a likely target for clinical therapy for autism in the future. Above all, I want my readers to take away a better understanding of the gut-brain axis and how its imbalance can be implicated in brain disorders like autism.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Introduction</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including difficulty with communication, social interaction, and restricted and repetitive behaviors that present differently in every individual [1]. Although 1 in 54 children are estimated to be on the autism spectrum according to the CDC [2], the etiology of the condition remains poorly understood. Factors including genetics and certain maternal environmental conditions have been identified as potential contributors to the development of ASD in children, but the exact cause is still unknown [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0A common comorbidity experienced by ASD individuals is gastrointestinal (GI) problems\u2014including abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea \u2014as such, autism research is pivoting towards studying the gut microbiome. [1]. Specifically, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">link between the composition of the gut microbiome and brain development has been established in recent years \u2014 termed the \u201cgut-brain axis\u201d\u2014 and it appears to be the future of autism research.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This literature review aims to identify the role of the human gut microbiome on the development of autism-like behavior and investigate whether therapies targeting the gut microbiome can be effective clinical treatments for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The article will first define the differences observed in gut microbiota between autistic and neurotypical individuals, then discuss how these differences in composition may affect brain development, and finally propose clinical implications targeting gut microbiota that appear promising in the treatment and diagnosis of ASD-related behaviors.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gut Microbiome of ASD Patients Differ From Neurotypical Individuals</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The gut microbiomes of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients have defining characteristics that significantly differ from those of neurotypical individuals. The human gut microbiome consists of a diverse array of predominantly bacteria but also archaea, eukarya and viruses that possess unique microbial enzymes to aid humans in digestion and also a variety of other physiological functions [4]. The three phyla </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firmicutes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bacteroidetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Actinobacteria</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [5] encompass the majority of bacteria present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that aid in these functions. However, an imbalance between the ratio of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firmicutes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Bacteroidetes </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">bacteria is found in autistic individuals when compared to the microbiome composition of neurotypical subjects; in particular, patients with autism tend to have an overexpression of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firmicutes </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in their gut [6,7]. Other studies have demonstrated an excess of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Clostridium</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> genus in the ASD microbiome [8]</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">as well as an overexpression of the genus </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bacilli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in the mouths and gut of autistic individuals [7]. While the cause behind this imbalance is unknown, these findings signify a consistent pattern of microbial imbalance in the autistic gut microbiome. In fact, a Random Forest prediction model, a computer algorithm that can classify large sets of data into subgroup \u201ctrees\u201d based on data similarity, was able to distinguish ASD children from neurotypical children with a high degree of certainty from just microbiome sequencing data [7], demonstrating the predictability of this dysbiosis by artificial intelligence.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4048 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"341\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-5.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-5-200x133.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-5-272x182.png 272w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-5-300x200.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-5-400x266.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-5.png 512w\" width=\"512\"/></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1: This illustrates the difference between species richness and species abundance. Species richness, a measure of alpha diversity, informs on how many species are present in a sample. Species abundance describes how many organisms of each species are present.\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Along with microbial imbalance\u2014termed dysbiosis\u2014autistic children also tend to have a decreased alpha diversity [7,9], which measures mean species diversity, as well as significantly lower gut species richness [7], the number of species present, when compared to age and sex-matched neurotypical children. One study found that for neurotypical children, alpha diversity, species richness, and species abundance all increased between the age groups 2-3 to 7-11; yet for ASD children, no significant development in microbial composition was observed with increase in age [7]. Since autism has been found to slow brain development as children age [9], this </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reduced development of the microbiome mirrors the altered brain development characteristic of ASD pathophysiology, proposing an association between decreased microbial diversity and autism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Due to this observed correlation between dysbiosis and ASD, whether gut dysbiosis is truly causal for autism has come into question. In a preliminary study, Sharon et al transplanted fecal microbiota from autistic donors into otherwise germ-free mice (mice with a sterile gut) and observed their offspring\u2019s behavior compared to offspring of mice inoculated with microbiota from neurotypical donors. Notably, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">mice with the ASD microbiome</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014 characterized by decreased alpha and beta diversity and decreased </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bacteroidetes </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">exhibited behaviors paralleling those of autism, including repetitive behaviors, decreased locomotion and decreased communication </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[9]. This demonstrated that gut dysbiosis can in fact induce the behavioral deficits observed in ASD. This is significant evidence toward the theory that gut dysbiosis indeed contributes to ASD \u2013 an important finding that changes our current understanding of the etiology of autism.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4049 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" sizes=\"(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-6.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-6-200x265.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-6-226x300.png 226w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2021/11/unnamed-6.png 386w\" width=\"386\"/></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 2: Above is a visual depiction of the study conducted by Sharon &amp; colleagues, where germ-free mice were inoculated with gut microbiota from either autistic or neurotypical donors. Offspring of the mice transplanted with ASD microbiome were shown to exhibit autism-like behavior.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How Microbiota Imbalance Affects Brain Function: The Gut-Brain Axis</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since the microbial dysbiosis found to be common in ASD patients contributes to behavioral deficits, several different mechanisms have been proposed for how the altered microbial environment in ASD patients can affect brain development.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Intestinal permeability</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The microbes that line the GI tract provide structural and protective benefits to our intestines, including stimulating epithelial cell regeneration and mucus production by the intestinal walls. When microbial diversity is decreased, the integrity of the intestinal walls may be compromised which can lead to increased intestinal permeability [8]. This may allow for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pro-inflammatory endotoxin that is found in gram-negative bacterial cell walls, to escape out of the GI tract and into the bloodstream. Serum levels of LPS are in fact found to be significantly higher in autistic individuals [12].</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LPS causes inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and is found to impair cognition and motivation in the mouse model. Specifically, implications for impaired continuous attention and curiosity behaviors, along with modulation of other areas of the brain like the central amygdala have been associated with circulating LPS [11]. Therefore, altered intestinal permeability is a possible mechanism by which dysbiosis modulates brain inflammation, a hallmark of autism that is thought to contribute to its behavioral symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Microbial metabolites</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As gut microbes carry out cellular functions inside their human hosts, they also secrete compounds as by-products of metabolism. Two such metabolites are 5AV and taurine, which are secreted by gut </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bacteroides</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">xylanisolvens </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and other bacteria. 5AV and taurine levels are found to be significantly lower in autistic individuals [13,14] as well as mice transplanted with ASD microbiome [9], likely due to dysbiosis. Both 5AV and taurine are gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) receptor antagonists, meaning that lower levels of these circulating microbial metabolites can alter the inhibitory signaling of GABA in the nervous system [9]. GABA regulates various developmental processes in the brain, including cell differentiation and synapse formation, so dysfunction in GABA signalling is thought to account for ASD symptoms [15]. Oral administration of taurine and 5AV in a mouse model of ASD with an altered microbiome is shown to reduce repetitive behavior and increase social behavior, suggesting that the deficiencies in these metabolites may contribute to the behavioral manifestations of autism [9]. There are other microbial metabolite imbalances in autistic children, including dopaquinone, pyroglutamic acid, and other molecules involved in neurotransmitter production. These imbalances affect brain signaling pathways, and therefore could contribute to the behavioral deficits often present in autistic children. Further, these metabolite imbalances correlate with the levels of certain gut bacteria, further emphasizing the link between the gut microbiome and neurological disorders such as ASD. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Clinical Implications for ASD Diagnosis and Treatment</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, symptoms of autism are alleviated with behavioral and educational therapy, and no pharmaceutical treatment exists [1]. With the knowledge that the gut microbiome significantly differs in autistic individuals and that these differences are shown to interfere with the nervous system, preliminary research has been done on potential diagnostics and pharmaceutical therapeutics for ASD that target dysbiosis in the gut.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Diagnostics</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To date, there is no objective laboratory test to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children, so autism is primarily diagnosed through a doctor\u2019s evaluation of a patient\u2019s behavior and developmental history. However, the ability of a computer program to distinguish the autistic microbiome from the neurotypical microbiome holds potential for use in ASD clinical risk assessments through analysis of the gut microbiome, and subsequent gut health monitoring interventions for those detected to have ASD-like dysbiosis [7]. The strong association between the presence of certain bacterial species in the mouth and bacteria in the gut \u2014 in particular the significant positive correlation between saliva </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chloroflexi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and gut </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Firmicutes\u2014</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">may suggest possible oral biomarkers to predict gut microbial diversity [6]. In addition, the overexpression of certain bacteria in the gut have been identified to be associated with certain symptoms like allergies and abdominal pain, opening an avenue to improve the diagnosis process of ASD through the inclusion of a more objective, laboratory-based test [6].</span></p>\n<p><h4>Microbiota Transfer Therapy</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT) is an emerging therapy that aims to replace the gut microbiome of ASD individuals with a more diverse, healthy gut microbiome. One form of MTT consists of a two-week oral vancomycin antibiotic treatment, followed by a bowel cleanse using MoviPrep, and then finally an extended fecal microbiota transplant for 7-8 weeks, administered orally or rectally. In a clinical trial involving autistic children, MTT significantly increased gut bacterial diversity 8 weeks after treatment stopped, along with improving GI symptoms (including abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhea and constipation) measured through the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). Significant improvements in behavioral ASD symptoms were found post treatment as well, measured through increases from baseline scores on a variety of exams that evaluate social skills, irritability, hyperactivity and communication, among other behaviors [16]. These improvements in microbial diversity and subsequently ASD-related behavior were all found to have been maintained at follow-up study two years later, indicating that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> MTT is a safe and efficient therapy that has potential to improve ASD outcomes in the long-term [</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">17]. However, further studies on the efficacy of MTT are necessary to establish this connection, as the above study sample was small and most symptoms and improvements were self-reported.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Probiotics</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because imbalances in the microbiome are correlated with autism, direct administration of bacterial cultures using probiotics seems to be a potential approach to treat ASD behavioral symptoms. Probiotic treatment that included a combination of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Bifildobacterium </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">was found to be effective in improving core behavioral symptoms of ASD, specifically adaptive functioning, developmental pathways, and multisensory processing in autistic children with GI symptoms [18]. Probiotics have been shown to improve symptoms of other mood disorders like anxiety and depression, both of which are associated with dysbiosis and the gut-brain axis [8],</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">warranting further research on probiotics as a treatment for ASD. Therapies that target microbial metabolite imbalances in ASD individuals, like 5AV and taurine, may also open an avenue for future autism research [9].</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The gut microbiome contributes to the maintenance of much of human physiology, with involvement in not only the digestive system but also the immune system and the brain. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been found to be prevalent in children and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and this dysbiosis may be linked to the behavioral symptoms observed. Treatments that target the gut microbiome, therefore, serve to be useful in improving behavioral deficits associated with ASD and should be a consideration for future research with more rigorous experimental design.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mayo Clinic.

This issue is</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">exacerbated by the failure of past research to produce any antivirals that</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">prove safe and effective in early clinical trials [2]. An effective antiviral would</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">significantly reduce the global mortality and morbidity of flaviviruses, but</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">development is long and difficult. The process of producing an antiviral</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">relies on knowledge of a critical mechanism in a virus\u2019s infectious biology.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the case that this knowledge applies to more than one virus, the potential</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">exists to develop an antiviral with broad efficacy- saving essential time and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">money. </span><h4>Flaviviruses as a genus share many fundamental attributes in their</h4> <h4>infectious biology, particularly concerning their use of vesicles. These</h4> <h4>conserved features could be exploited to create antivirals with broad</h4> <h4>efficacy within the genus.</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The flaviviruses referred to here include Zika (ZIKV), Dengue</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">virus (DENV), Langat virus (LGTV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Powassan</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> virus (POWV). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This review will discuss recent advancements in</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">our understanding of the role vesicles play in the infectious biology of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">flaviviruses.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> will include </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">release from endosomes after entry into the cell, viral replication within the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> unique</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u201cvesicle packet\u201d organelle, and a novel exosome-based mechanism of infection.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, we will explore how this knowledge could inform drug</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> development.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Background</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flaviviruses are a genus of enveloped viruses, meaning that their</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">genetic material is contained within a lipid bilayer. Embedded in this bilayer</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">are the Envelope (E) protein (sometimes called E-glycoprotein) and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Membrane (M) protein. E-Protein is responsible for attaching naked viral particles (virions)</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to target cell membranes, upon which they enter the cell via</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> clathrin-mediated endocytosis [3]. The clathrin coated proteins mold a small bubble of host membrane material\u2013an endosomal vesicle\u2013which carries the virions into the cell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For the viral genome to escape the endosome, and enter the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cytoplasm, the viral envelope must fuse with the membrane of the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">endosome. Fusion is initiated by the acidic pH of endosomes, which drives a conformational shift in viral E-protein that merges the viral envelope with</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the endosome </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[3]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This mechanism is conserved in all</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> flaviviruses.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flaviviruses also utilize a unique replication organelle, derived from</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), called the vesicle packet. The</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">vesicle packet is an invagination into the ER membrane in which the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">machinery of viral replication is contained, and likely protected from host</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cell innate-immune factors. A combination of host factors and viral proteins,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">including non-structural</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">protein 1 (NS1) conserved in flaviviruses, work together to construct the vesicle. [4].</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, the specific host factors involved in vesicle packet formation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> were largely unknown until recently.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once translated and assembled, virions exit the cell via the secretory</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pathway, including the trans-Golgi-network (TGN). Like the endosome earlier in</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the life cycle, the TGN has an acidic pH. M-protein requires</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this acidic pH to mature. Specifically, prM, the precursor to M-protein,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">undergoes an acid-driven conformational shift which exposes cleavage</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">sites for Furin-protease, a host protease [5]. Cleavage releases mature</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">M-protein from \u2018prM\u2019. The \u2018pr\u2019 element itself is responsible for preventing</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">premature fusion of the virion envelope with host membranes, so it remains</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">associated with the virion until secretion [5]. The dissociation</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">of \u2018pr\u2019 after cleavage allows the mature virion to later undergo acid-driven</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> fusion with endosomes in a new cell, completing the cycle [5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Endosomal release and niclosamide\u2019s antiviral potential</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A compound that safely inhibits endosomal and secretory pathway</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">acidification could represent a pan-flavivirus antiviral. This</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">because</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">attenuation of acidic</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pH would</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">prevent the conformational shift in E-protein necessary for the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">fusion of the virion with the endosome. Recently, researchers determined</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that niclosamide\u2013an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug previously known to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">inhibit ZIKV infection\u2013did exactly this in DENV-infected cells [6]. Niclosamide is a protonophore;a compound that can exchange</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">protons across membranes, bypassing the proton pumps responsible for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">endosomal acidification. Treatment with niclosamide significantly reduced</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">viral load in baby-hamster-kidney (BHK21) cultures infected with DENV.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Using pH-sensitive dye A0, which turns from clear to pink at pH 6, the mechanism was confirmed to be</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">attenuation of endosomal acidification. Additionally, a western blot of DENV</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">protein-E showed that the acid-driven confirmation shift in protein-E</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">necessary for endosomal fusion did not take place. This western blot relied on the fact that E-protein\u2019s conformational shift results in its degradation. An antibody could visualize E-protein in the SDS-page (electrophoresis which separates proteins by mass) of the treatment group, meaning the degradation did not take place. This indicates that the conformational shift was blocked by niclosamide as hypothesized. Because no effects</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">were noted on viral genome replication or endocytosis independently of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">endosomal release, the authors do not put forward any additional</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> mechanisms of action.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, another study found that niclosamide also prevents the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">maturation of DENV in human (Huh7) cells via deacidification of the TGN [7]. Researchers determined that deacidification inhibited</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cleavage of DENV/ZIKV prM protein by preventing the exposure of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">furan-protease cleavage sites. Compared to a control, Western blot of the treatment</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">grouprevealed uncleaved prM when niclosamide</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">was present. Virions with immature prM protein due to niclosamide</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">treatment would be unable to fuse with endosomes upon infection of a new</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cell and are thus dead. The authors suggest discrepancies from Kao</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al [6] arrose because they used different time points in their analysis of</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> niclosamide\u2019s effect on genome replication and virion maturation.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Niclosamide\u2019s ability to de-acidify endosomes and the TGNdemonstrates its potential as a pan-flavivirus antiviral, given that</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E-protein and prM are conserved and essential in all flaviviruses. Both</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">authors argue that niclosamide\u2019s safety as an antiparasitic drug and its</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">effect on ZIKA and DENV warrant investigation into antiviral applications.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, both studies put forward inhibition of endosomal release as a</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">viable strategy in anti-flavivirus drug development overall. Jung et al also</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> recommend inhibition of prM cleavage for therapeutic investigation.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Targeting host factors in \u2018Vesicle packet\u2019 formation</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Replication inside the vesicle packet is another potential target for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pan-flavivirus antiviral development because it is conserved in the genus.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Knowledge of the involved host factors\u2013proteins in the host that the virus manipulates to its own ends\u2013could allow for antivirals that</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">knockout vesicle packet formation, inhibiting viral replication. Recently, a</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">class of host ER-shaping proteins called Atlastins were found to play a role</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in the formation of the vesicle packet [8]. Researchers</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">used small-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), which are processed into silencing siRNA to knock out various atlastins in A529 cells exposed to ZIVK,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DENV, and WNV. Transmission electron microscopy, which uses electrons to visualize microscopic structures, revealed that</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Atlastin-2 (ATL2) knockout shrunk both the size and number of vesicle</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">packets, and disrupted their localization. Immunofluorescence, which visualizes the location of small molecules using a fluorescent antibody, then showed</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that the localization of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was changed. This indicates that the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">coordination of vesicle packets with the replicating viral genome was</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">disrupted. Also, the overall viral load of ZIKV, DENV, and WNV was reduced by</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Atlastin-2 knockout. In the case of ZIKV, this reduction was potentially as much as</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">16-fold. While the authors make no specific recommendations, future</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">research should explore whether these factors inhibit flavivirus replication</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">outside of DENV, ZIKV, and WNV. Given that all flaviviruses form a vesicle packet for replication, the host factors they manipulate to do so may be the same. If</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this is the case, disruption of flavivirus/Atlastin interaction may be a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> powerful therapeutic approach.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A host protein called Receptor of Activated C Kinase (RACK1)has also been identified as essential to vesicle packet</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">formation for flaviviruses WNV, DENV, POWV, and LGTV [9]. Researchers used a similar approach to Neufeldt et al, employing</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> small \u2018interfering\u2019 RNAs (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">siRNAs) to silence host factors and measure the effect on viral load.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Specifically, a CRISPR-based genome-wide knockout screen using</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LentiCRISPRv2-GecKO (an siRNA library) provided siRNAs to human Huh7.5</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cells. RACK1 knockout produced the strongest reduction in viral load out of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">all targets. To determine the mechanism, researchers analyzed the time</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">dependency of viral load reduction on RACK1 knockout. The results</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">indicated that RACK1 did not act on viral entry or translation, but rather on</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">replication, which brought attention to the vesicle packet. Transmission</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">electron microscopy then demonstrated a significant reduction in vesicle</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">packets after RACK1 knockout. Immunofluorescence found that viral NS1, a known critical factor in vesicle packet formation, failed to localize to the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ER. The failure of NS1 to localize to the ER during RACK1 knockout would</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">suggest that an interaction between NS1 and RACK1 is necessary for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">vesicle packet formation. Co-expression of RACK1 and NS1 gave strong</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">evidence for their co-localization. To confirm the interaction, a pulldown</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">assay- which measures binding affinity between two molecules- was performed and RACK1 was proven to bind NS1. The authors</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">thus posit that RACK1 is responsible for localizing NS1 and that RACK1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> knockout disrupts vesicle packet formation by the failure of NS1 to localize.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The discovery of ATL2 and RACK1 as host factors necessary to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the formation of the vesicle packet offers new targets for disrupting</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">flavivirus replication. The respective authors argue that dependence on</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">RACK1 and Atlastin-2 for vesicle packet formation is likely conserved in all</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">flaviviruses. Shue et al thus argue that RACK1 is a promising target for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">antiviral development, and recommend further research into RACK1</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">knockout as a therapeutic strategy. ATL2\u2019s importance to vesicle packet formation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> warrants exploration into its potential as a pan-flavivirus antiviral target.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Exosome-based infection  SMase and Tsp29Fb as drug targets</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recently, three studies have identified a novel exosome-based</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">mechanism of flavivirus infection and identified potential targets for antiviral</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">development. Zhou et al, (2018) found that LGTV uses extracellular</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">vesicles (exosomes) from its tick host to infect mammalian cells, and that</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infected mammalian brain-endothelial cells, which make up the blood-brain barrier, produce exosomes capable of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infecting neuronal cells [10]. In a follow-up to their 2018</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">study, Zhou et al (2019) found that ZIKA-infected, neuronal-cell-derived</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">exosomes readily infected neurons of the cortex [11]. A third</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">study, Vora et al, demonstrated that exosomes derived from</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DENV-infected mosquitoes were infectious to human blood-endothelial</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cells [12]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The ability of flaviviruses to use exosomes, derived from host cells, to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infect other cells was previously unknown and represents a significant</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> advancement in our understanding of their infectious biology as a genus.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, GW4869, an exosome release inhibitor, proved to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reduce viral load in cell cultures infected with their respective flavivirus in all</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cases. GW4869 works by inhibiting sphingomyelinase (SMase), an enzyme</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that produces lipids necessary for exosome formation. The effect of</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GW4869 on viral load confirms that exosomes provide significant infectious</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">potential, in a novel mechanism, for 3 prominent flaviviruses: LGTV, ZIKV,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and DENV. GW4869\u2019s ability to inhibit this mechanism in all three suggests</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that an antiviral targeting exosome release may have efficacy across the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">genus. All three studies thus cite GW4869 as a promising target for</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">drug development to disrupt flavivirus infection via exosomes. GW4869\u2019s</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">efficacy also suggests the anti-flaviviral potential of SMase inhibition more</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> broadly.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All three studies used immunoblotting and quantitative real-time PCR</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to show the enrichment of viral RNA and proteins in infectious exosomes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All three also confirmed that these viral components are fully inside the</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">exosomes. To do this, they exposed these exosomes to RNase and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">flavivirus envelope protein antibodies, which neutralize the infectious</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">potential of naked virions by degrading exposed viral RNA and protein. The</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infectious potential of exosomes was unaffected by RNase or antibody</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">treatment. All three studies thus argue that the exosome protects viral RNA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and protein from antibodies and RNase.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vora et al also found that Tsp29Fb\u2013an ortholog of high similarity to human exosome</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">marker CD63\u2013was enriched on infected extracellular vesicles [12]. Specifically, qRT-PCR, which tracks the expression of RNA over time, found that Tsp29Fb was overexpressed</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">during infection. Additionally, the CD63 antibody (which is highly cross-reactive with</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tsp29Fb) was used in immunoblotting to show that Tsp29Fb is enriched on</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the exosomes. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers then used immunoprecipitation, which removes a target from solution using an antibody, to find that Tsp29Fb binds DENV envelope protein.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This binding interaction indicates</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tsp29Fb may play a role in DENV\u2019s ability to use exosomes for infection. To</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">test this, researchers silenced Tsp29Fb with siRNA and found drastically</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reduced viral protein in the resulting exosomes. The researchers posit that</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tsp29Fb thus plays a role in loading protein into secretory vesicles</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">post-translation, which then exit the cell as infectious exosomes. For that</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reason, the authors put Tsp29Fb silencing forward as an antiviral</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> development tactic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These three studies demonstrate that extracellular vesicles provide</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infectious potential to three flaviviruses. Additionally, two promising</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">candidates for antiviral research have been put forward to disrupt viral</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">exosomes. Namely, GW4869 targeting SMase, and Tsp29Fb as a target</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">itself.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flaviviruses as a genus have great similarities in their infectious</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">biology concerning their manipulation of host membranes and vesicles.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Post-entry endosomal release and the formation of the vesicle packet are</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">shared features of the flavivirus infection cycle. In a completely new infectious mechanism, LGTV, ZIKV, and DENV were all found to invade new cells using exosomes. All three discussed uses of vesicles have been proven</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">essential to infection and are present in multiple flaviviruses. Furthermore,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">workable targets for the inhibition of these faculties have been identified,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">which subsequently reduce viral load in vitro</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Multiple promising candidates</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">for drug development have thus emerged from these targets.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Future research should focus on whether an exosome-based infection is</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">present in other flaviviruses and establish the relevance of SMase and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tsp29Fb to the broader genus. If exosome-based infection proves critical to</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">flaviviruses more broadly, SMase may be a viable target, and GW4869</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> might have potential as a pan-flavivirus antiviral. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> respect to targeting replication in the vesicle packet, RACK1 and ATL2 knockout should be investigated for safety and efficacy. Niclosamide\u2019s ability to inhibit post-entry edosomal release must also be established in the genus as a whole, and the therapeutic dose already approved by the FDA for other conditions should be tested for efficacy against flavivirus.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Pierson, T.C., Diamond, M.S.
