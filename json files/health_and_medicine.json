        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>Being born female automatically registers you in a game of Russian roulette: one out of eight women will have invasive breast cancer during their lives. Breast cancer is a disease that starts in the tissues of the breast and is statistically fatal for about one in thirty-six women (Breast Cancer Facts), but that does not mean it is a walk in the park for its survivors or even for women who end up not developing the disease. <span id=\"more-433\"></span> My closest experience with breast cancer has been with my Aunt Hala, who was born in Lebanon in 1962 and still lives there. Hala was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. To Lebanese, cancer is referred to as \u201cThe malicious disease\u201d or, reminiscent of Lord Voldemort, \u201cthe-not-to-be-named disease.\u201d People refuse to even mention the word cancer (\u201csarattan\u201d in Arabic), and many who get it are kept in the dark about what is afflicting them. They pass away unaware of their real condition, thinking they have a bad cold instead of lung cancer or a bad intestinal infection or an ulcer rather than gastrointestinal cancer, and so on. \u00a0However, this silence is not the case with breast cancer; everyone is aware that once you have a lump, you end up losing your entire breast through a mastectomy, as in Hala\u2019s case, or if you\u2019re \u201clucky\u201d, then you end up having a lumpectomy and only a portion of your breast is removed. And if the odds aren\u2019t in your favor, you may end up losing your life all together.</p>\n<p>Hala, the youngest among five sisters, initially ignored her lump. The thought of having the disease was stressful enough to send her into complete denial. By the time she casually mentioned it to one of her sisters a few weeks after discovering what felt like a \u201chard lump\u201d in her right breast, hoping the older sister would also be nonchalant about it, the disease was at stage three. The denial phase of cancer is common for most women, as studies show that more than one third of women who feel a lump in their breast postpone going to the doctor for at least three months (Jauhar). This could be due to multiple reasons, such as the cost of cancer treatment, fear of a mastectomy, the terror of chemotherapy, or the thought of death.</p>\n<p>Soon after her first doctor\u2019s visit, Hala went from denial to acceptance; the anger stage never came. She put up a strong front that helped all of us cope with this dreaded intruder into the family. Aisha, the eldest of the sisters, had a hard time accepting that Hala had cancer and kept hoping it would be benign until the mastectomy. Another aunt insisted that she should not accept the surgeon\u2019s recommendation of \u201ccarving her up\u201d and kept referring to the surgeon as the \u201cbutcher.\u201d Others unknowingly opted for a worse approach\u2014not talking about the issue at all\u2014giving Hala the feeling that the Angel of Death had parked his chariot outside her door.</p>\n<p>It is stressful enough for a person to be diagnosed with stage three breast cancer, but what is overlooked is the barrage of issues that surface that forces you to look at your illness as only one of many issues that unfold. \u00a0You are forced to alleviate the pain and worries of others as they worry not only about you, but also about themselves, because you having cancer makes the Russian roulette game even more dangerous for them. I could only imagine how my other aunts felt as they watched Hala battle cancer, as the doctor informed them during the six chemotherapy and twenty-five radiation sessions that the risk of them developing breast cancer doubles automatically since they now have a close blood relative\u2014 their baby sister\u2014 with the disease. The barrel was now staring them hard in the chest, and the troubles of searching for the best doctors and hospitals with the latest medical equipment and treatments only added to their worries. \u00a0Hala\u2019s main worries came from informing relatives overseas, receiving constant phone calls and visits from well-wishers, and pondering over the the big brain teasers of \u201cwhat if\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p>The \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d invaded Hala\u2019s thoughts day and night: what if I lose both of my breasts, or the cancer is metastatic and spreads to other parts of my body, or what if the cancer I have is not responsive to chemotherapy, or worse, what if I have prolonged illness and my body wilts away?</p>\n<p>Women who get the disease worry about the hardship of treatment, the dreaded five-year wait before you can be blessed with the \u201cin remission\u201d certificate, and the lifelong uncertainty about whether the disease will resurrect itself. One year after her mastectomy, the doctors reassessed her progress and recommended an oophorectomy, which is the removal of the ovaries in order to reduce the amount of steroid hormones, progesterone and estrogen, circulating in the system (Eldor and Spiegel, 81). Hala\u2019s doctor explained to her that estrogen was to tumor cells what fertilizer is to weeds. As a consequence of the oophorectomy, she developed osteoporosis, which is the weakening and dissolving of the bones caused by a lack of estrogen. Currently, Hala still has osteoporosis and is taking Provila once a month to strengthen her bones, in addition to the calcium supplement she takes every day. Hala and her sisters were grateful to her doctor for taking the time to inform them about the disease. Consequently, mammograms have become an annual tradition in my family that was never strictly adhered to before Hala\u2019s ordeal. In Hala\u2019s words, \u201cby understanding my disease and available treatment options, I voluntarily accepted the poisonous medications the doctor prescribed me.\u201d</p>\n<p>Hala described her medications as \u201cpoisonous\u201d after experiencing the bouts of vomiting, lack of appetite, weakness, and severe nausea every time she would take them (this is not to mention the burning feeling, after each one of the twenty-five radiation sessions Hala attended, that would only go away once she rubbed a pound of Biafine ointment on her breast). \u00a0In fact, every time Hala came near the Rezk Hospital in Beirut for her chemotherapy session, she would automatically show \u201canticipatory nausea and vomiting.\u201d This phenomenon occurs at the sight, smell, and sound of the treatment center that reminds patients of previous chemotherapy sessions (National Cancer Institute). Once the stomach-twisting feeling of nausea crept over her, not even the prescribed Zofran could stop it. There came a time when Hala felt so defeated during the chemotherapy sessions that she wondered whether it was easier to succumb to the disease than to withstand the punishment of the medications. Her six chemotherapy sessions, twenty-one days apart, strangled the life out of her, and in the words of Hala: \u201cThe doctors will strangle you and the disease to the brink of death\u2014hoping the disease will surrender first\u201d.</p>\n<p>The breast of a woman signifies the bounty of a crop, the generosity of a rain cloud over a thirsty land yearning to be quenched. \u00a0Humans are born to suckle the juice of life from the breast the minute they exit the womb, when cancer targets that organ, an afflicted woman cannot help but feel an onslaught upon her being. Nature, for some unknown reason, has thrown a poison into her wellspring, and modern medicine\u2019s \u201ccure,\u201d to date, is as cruel as the disease itself.</p>\n<p>While many studies have characterized those affected by breast cancer, based on age, drinks per day, smoking, race, breast-feeding, etc, a cure or a vaccination for the disease has not been discovered yet. \u00a0Women are still waiting for a quantum leap in the field of medicine, where gene therapy or manipulation of various amino acids will eventually replace chemotherapy, radiation, and the surgical carving up of patients. Nine years after her breast and ovaries were taken from her, \u00a0Hala still stands strong as a powerful symbol to all women. By enduring through the physical, mental, and spiritual tribulations of cancer, Hala has been a positive impact on her family and community as she openly discusses her experience battling cancer and is an avid promoter and participant of regular breast cancer screening\u2014and most importantly\u2014she is a survivor.<h4></h4></p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Board, A.D.A.M.. \u201cBreast cancer.\u201d <i>Breast cancer</i>.

The only signs considered markers for Sjogren\u2019s are anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, and while anti-SSB is more specific, elevated levels of anti-SSB are actually less common in patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome than anti-SSA, leading to some ambiguity in diagnosis.</p>\n<p>A seventeen year old female patient presented with a large, soft, sublingual cyst on the left side of the floor of her mouth. While she reported no pain, the cyst was first spotted about a year earlier, and had been growing steadily. Visible swelling was observed on the left side of her face under her jaw line. Surgery was performed to remove the cyst, and an adjacent salivary gland was removed as well. The otorhinolaryngologist took a tissue sample, and histology confirmed a benign growth. The surgeon ordered a blood panel to evaluate antibody levels that might indicate an autoimmune disease. The patient\u2019s serum was negative for rheumatoid factor, anti-SSB antibodies, and anti-nuclear antibodies. However, she was positive for anti-SSA antibodies, with a level of 50 U/ml. Bacterial cultures were negative for oral infection, and an X-ray was negative for sarcoidosis. Patient was discharged after surgery with no medications indicated, as she was not experiencing any other symptoms.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-501\"></span></p>\n<p>At age twenty, the patient again noticed a sublingual cyst on the floor of her mouth, this time on her right side. Upon inspection, the otorhinolaryngologist confirmed the presence of a lymphangioma. Two months later, it had grown and caused the adjacent sublingual salivary gland to rupture, resulting in a ranula at the floor of her mouth. The patient sought treatment, and the otorhinolaryngologist ordered an MRI to examine the ranula. The lymphangioma was found to be growing towards another salivary gland, presumably causing the sialadenitis observed in that gland. The ranula and the ruptured sublingual salivary gland were then surgically excised. Histology again ruled out malignancy, but suggested Sjogren\u2019s syndrome or another autoimmune disease.</p>\n<p>The ENT surgeon referred the patient to a rheumatologist, who performed a blood panel to rule out other autoimmune disorders. The patient was again negative for rheumatoid factor and her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal. However, her IgG subclass 4 levels were 253 mg/ml, well beyond the normal range of 0-150 mg/ml.</p>\n<p>The rheumatologist also tested for other signs and symptoms of Sjogren\u2019s. The patient was negative for dry skin, dry mouth, joint pain, circulation or perfusion issues, and general fatigue. Family history was mostly negative for any signs or symptoms of Sjogren\u2019s aside from the patient\u2019s mother having dry eyes. The mother reported no other symptoms and was not tested for Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. No other additional abnormalities were observed.<h4></h4></p>\n<p>The patient was sent home but placed under observation with biannual checkups for three years after the second surgical removal of the cyst, and annual checkups indefinitely after that. Three months later, she complained of mild to moderate skin dryness, and was prescribed Lac-Hydrin 12% lotion and urea 40% lotion. An optometrist noticed mildly dry eyes, but no treatment was suggested. The patient currently lives otherwise symptom-free and has not had any recurrence of abnormal growths in her mouth.</p>\n<p><h4>Discussion</h4></p>\n<p>Sjogren\u2019s syndrome (SS), named after the Swedish ophthalmologist who first reported on the condition, is a relatively common autoimmune disease, affecting up to 2 million people in the United States. In patients with SS, the immune system attacks the salivary and lacrimal glands, causing dry mouth and dry eyes, respectively. There is no known cause of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, and no preventative treatment is known. However, genetic factors and environmental factors are suspected of playing a role in the development of the syndrome. There is some indication of high gluten sensitivity in patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, which can be related to the inflammation that gluten is known to potentially cause. Viral infections may also potentially increase the likelihood of SS through molecular mimicry that triggers autoimmunity.</p>\n<p>Common symptoms of SS are dry mouth, dry eyes, dry skin, and less often, general fatigue, rashes, and joint pain. The most typical symptoms are dry eyes and dry mouth, which range in severity. Some patients have mild discomfort, while others can experience blurry vision and chronic eye irritation, and patients with dry mouth can have difficulty swallowing or eating dry foods and an increased likelihood of tooth decay. Most patients with the disorder have mild to moderate symptoms, but in rare cases, SS can cause organ failure. Patients are also more susceptible to non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a cancer of the white blood cells. About 5% of patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome will have a malignant growth, but overall, the mortality rates of patients with SS are very similar to the normal population. While the symptoms are usually well managed and patients can live comfortably, patients who get pregnant have an increased risk of their elevated antibodies crossing the placenta and causing neonatal lupus erythematosus with a congenital heart block that requires a pacemaker.</p>\n<p>While treatments of the condition are currently not known, drugs that help manage symptoms can be prescribed to patients with moderate to severe symptoms. Artificial tears or eye lubricants can be used to alleviate dry eyes, and cyclosporine can reduce loss of eye moisture by reducing ocular inflammation that can inhibit secretion of tears. A punctal plug can also be inserted to slow the rate of tear drainage and allow tears to continue lubricating the eye for a longer time. \u00a0Several OTC mouthwashes are available to reduce oral dryness, and cevimeline can be used to stimulate salivation. Hydroxychloroquine can be used to treat joint pain and rashes on a symptomatic basis. More severe systemic symptoms, especially of the internal organs, can be treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs, but must be used with caution due to increased risk of infections. Patients, particularly those with dry mouth, must be regularly monitored for tooth decay, as dental caries are quite common and can progress to severe decay if left untreated.</p>\n<p>Like other autoimmune disorders, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome is difficult to diagnose definitively, and relies on antibody levels, physical signs, and patient symptoms. The oral cavity in particular must be examined for any growths associated with salivary gland occlusion or blockage. Elevated levels of anti-nuclear antibodies can indicate SS, and are present in about 70% of patients. Rheumatoid factor is also common in SS patients (60-70%) but can be indicative of other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels of IgG subclass 4 are also commonly found in SS patients but are not specific. The antibodies that are considered actual markers for SS are anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies. While elevated anti-SSA antibodies are more common than anti-SSB antibodies in SS patients (about 70% vs 40%), the latter is a more specific marker for SS, while the former can also indicate systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>\n<p>Since Sjogren\u2019s syndrome can be secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, it is essential for healthcare providers to rule out these potentially more severe diseases. Diagnosing them, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, can be difficult since there are not any exact, definitive markers or tests available. A rheumatoid factor assay is essential on any blood panel, since that is an indicator of rheumatoid arthritis, and an x-ray to rule out sarcoidosis in the lungs is recommended to avoid missing an underlying cause of rheumatoid arthritis that may look like simply SS on a blood test. The SS markers anti-SSA and anti-SSB must be included on the blood panel as well, but since anti-SSA is also indicative of lupus, caution should be used in diagnosing a patient with SS until other antibody levels are assessed and a thorough physical examination is performed.</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<p>[SSF] Diagnosis.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>What do you picture when you think about surgery? Most likely, you imagine a person having their body cut open, and then a surgeon performing what is necessary to fix the problem, whether that be removing a damaged organ or tissue, repairing damages internally, or performing some other procedure. In all of these cases, it is expected that the doctor makes a cut large enough so that he or she can see what is inside of the body and operates. However, a new method of surgery takes a radically different approach. Laparoscopic surgery, also called minimally invasive surgery, Band-Aid surgery, or keyhole surgery, is a relatively new surgical technique that is revolutionizing the surgical field. Traditionally, surgery is performed by making a large incision in order to directly view and operate on the tissues, organs, and other structures of interest inside of the body. In contrast, with laparoscopic surgery, a series of small incisions, typically of .5 cm to 1.5 cm, are made along the abdomen.<span id=\"more-511\"></span> At each incision, commonly referred to as a port, a small tube called a trocar is inserted, and it essentially serves as an entrance for other materials that are necessary for the surgery. First, carbon dioxide gas must be inserted into the abdomen to inflate it, allowing space for the surgeon to view inside and perform the necessary work. Then, a camera attached to a laparoscope is inserted into the body and transmits images to a viewing screen in the room, which enables the surgeon to see what is necessary to perform the surgery. Other devices, such as surgical stapling devices and energy sources, are also passed through the trocars for other uses inside the body. \u00a0While most incisions for laparoscopic surgery are fairly small, often, a larger incision, ranging from 2 to 4 inches, must be made to allow removal of tissue. Additionally, hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is sometimes used. In this method, a larger incision is made, allowing for \u00a0the surgeon to insert his or her hand into the abdomen and thus directly perform the surgery, while still using the same devices as laparoscopic surgery (Peters, 2012). After the surgery is complete, the carbon dioxide is removed from abdomen, the devices inside are removed, and stitches are used to close the incisions.</p>\n<p>Although laparoscopic surgery is a relatively new technique and thus not entirely commonplace, there are many procedures that commonly use this method. Most of the procedures that utilize it are centered near the abdomen, as this is the area most easily accessible through the small incisions. The most common procedure using laparoscopic surgery is cholecystectomy, which is removal of the gallbladder. In fact, almost all gallbladder removals in the U.S. are now performed by laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, it is used for a variety of other procedures, examples being gastric bypass surgery, hernia repair, anti-reflux surgery, liver and biliary disease treatment, hiatal hernia treatment, splenectomy, colon and intestinal disorders, ulcer surgery, appendix removal, and adrenal gland removal (Saber, 2014). While traditional surgical procedures are still more common than the laparoscopic methods in some of these examples, there is a trend in increasing utilizing laparoscopic surgical techniques. Additionally, these are just the most common examples of laparoscopic procedures, and there are other procedures that utilize laparoscopic methods.</p>\n<p>There are many measures taken to ensure the safety of this procedure. To start, before the surgery is considered, the patient must undergo an abdomen inspection to ensure that they are a candidate for laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, previous health conditions are considered, as some conditions may put a patient at risk during the procedure. This measure decreases the likelihood of the patient experiencing any problems during the procedure. However, if there are problems during the operation, there are ways to prevent further damage. For instance, if there is too much inflammation, a larger incision will be made to complete the surgery. Additionally, if anything else goes wrong the surgeon can always modify the procedure to make sure it remains safe (Peters, 2012).</p>\n<p>There are a number of advantages to laparoscopic surgery as opposed to traditional surgery. To start, the small size of the incision provides a variety of benefits. First, it reduces the risk of blood loss and hemorrhaging, since the area being cut open is much smaller. This, in turn, reduces the need for blood transfusions, which minimizes the potential for infections. Additionally, internal organs are less externally exposed, also reducing the risk for infection. Beyond the advantages during the surgery, there are also advantages after the surgery is complete. To start, scarring is minimized, since the incisions are not as large. Additionally, the small incision size reduces the pain that the patient feels following the procedure, so he or she is able to return to their normal daily routine sooner. Lastly, the shorter recovery time allows for a shorter hospital stay, which both reduces hospital bills and decreases the amount of time that the patient is exposed to the possible infections associated with hospital stays (Mandal, 2010).</p>\n<p>Overall, laparoscopic surgery is a new advancement in medicine that allows for new methods of surgery that require fewer incisions and less pain. The procedure is just as safe as traditional surgery, and also provides a number of advantages to the patient, both during and following the procedure. For these reasons, laparoscopic surgery is becoming more popular, and once technology advances even further, it may take the place of traditional surgery almost entirely.</p>\n<p>Works Cited</p>\n<p>Mandal, Ananya, MD. \u201cLaparoscopic Surgery Advantages.\u201d News-Medical.net.

        "author": "Connie Chen, Microbiology, \u201916",
        "date": "11/30/2015",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Scope</h4></p>\n<p>This article was inspired by a friend who is an International Relations and Economics major. She was interested in the science behind HIV and AIDS because she only knew about the stigma carried with being infected with HIV and that it is an incurable virus. After talking to my friend for a few hours, I realized that many people don\u2019t know too much about HIV besides how it spreads and that there is no current cure. My friend was amazed by how complicated HIV was and hopes that future policies about HIV and AIDS will have more background information rather than going with public opinion about the virus. The overarching goal of the paper is to inform the reader about what HIV and AIDS is, what HIV does to the human body, and what treatments are currently available. I hope that you, the reader, will be able to carry out some form of conversation about HIV and AIDS after reading this article.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-626\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p>The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that causes the depletion of white blood cells involved in the immune system. HIV is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood, and has killed more than 25 million people worldwide since its discovery in 1981 (Barmania et al., 2013). It is important to note that having HIV does not automatically mean a person will be diagnosed with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows deadly diseases or opportunistic pathogens thrive and eventually kill the host. When white blood cells have fallen below a certain level, then a healthcare professional may diagnose the patient with AIDS. According to AIDS.gov, over 35 million people worldwide are currently living with HIV or AIDS.</p>\n<p><h4>What does HIV do to the body?</h4></p>\n<p>Whenever there is a threat to the body, such as a bacterial or viral infection, the immune system is able to detect and react to the situation. Once the cells of the immune system detect the threat, they are able to undergo selective divisions that increase the ability to identify the threat, and then initiate an immune response. Following these infections, the cells able to contain and eliminate the threat remain in the body as memory cells. These memory cells allow the immune system to initiate its defenses effectively when encountering the same threat, even years after initial infection (Parham, 2014). HIV attacks the immune system and compromises it. Every time HIV attacks the body, the number of white blood cells in a person significantly drops. The decreased number of white blood cells weakens the host\u2019s immune system and the host becomes more susceptible to other diseases and is less able to defend against them. Diseases such as the common cold, which a healthy adult can overcome in a few days, become deadly because the immune system is weakened.</p>\n<p>HIV is difficult to eradicate because HIV\u2019s replication process leads to different variations, making it a master of disguise. It was found that HIV has different techniques it uses in order to \u201chide\u201d inside white blood cells until the virus decides to replicate and divide (Stevenson et al., 1990). HIV will continue use the host\u2019s cells in order to replicate by producing viral proteins and assembling them into new viruses. Its ability to effectively mutate allows it to evade the fast immune attack from the immune system because it has no memory of the \u201cnew\u201d virus. The immune system must learn to recognize and fight a different version of the virus. However, during this time, the number of white blood cells decreases significantly and the host struggles to fight off other diseases. In summary, HIV destroys the human immune system internally making the host susceptible to opportunistic pathogens, and if the number of white blood cells is low enough, the host may be diagnosed with AIDS.</p>\n<p><h4>Treatment(s) Available</h4></p>\n<p>Although there is no cure for HIV, being infected with the virus is not a death sentence. The most effective treatment available is antiretroviral therapy (ART), which can significantly prolong the lives of people who are HIV-positive by using a combination of antiretroviral drugs in order to suppress the virus. In fact, with the continuous use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), most patients treated with ART live normal lives. However, suppressing the virus is only temporary and continuous treatment is necessary in order to prevent HIV from returning. Researchers are currently on the search for a less dependent treatment and more importantly, a vaccine.</p>\n<p><h4>Takeaway</h4></p>\n<p>When HIV and AIDS were first appeared in the 1980\u2019s, it was a very mysterious disease. It baffled many doctors, and scared the general public because it looked like healthy, young individuals were prematurely passing away for unexplained reasons. Fear is a dangerous emotion, and the fear surrounding the epidemic has resulted in the creation of many myths about HIV and AIDS, as well as negative attitudes towards those infected. Because HIV can only be transmitted through bodily fluids, HIV is often associated with behaviors people disapprove of, such as irresponsible drug use and immoral sexual behavior.</p>\n<p>Becoming more knowledgeable about HIV and AIDS can make us more aware and understanding of what someone who is HIV positive is going through and prevent HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Although HIV and AIDS is a large and active area of research, there is still no known cure as of today. Further studies are needed in order for the discovery of potential treatments and vaccines for HIV in the future. However, we can be educated about the topic of HIV and AIDS. Education about HIV and AIDS is important because of its prevalence in the world, and the best way to prevent the physical spread of HIV is by understanding the science behind it.</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<p>AIDS.gov. 2014.

Several longitudinal studies have demonstrated the potential of antihypertensive (AHD) treatment in preventing cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients.

In the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study (HAAS), researchers found that men who were treated with beta-blockers had a significantly lower risk of developing cognitive impairment compared to those without treatment especially for men who had higher blood pressure at baseline (3). Similarly, the Gingko Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS) found an association between the use of diuretics, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and a reduced risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in participants with normal cognition at baseline (4). While HAAS and GEMS included participants without cognitive impairment at baseline, Kan et al. (2013) observed the effect of ACE-I use on 70-85 year old hypertensive patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease and found that individuals with treatment had slower progressions of cognitive decline compared to those without treatment. Findings from these studies highlight the potential of AHD treatment in preventing cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients as well as in reducing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with baseline dementia.</p>\n<p><h4>AHD Treatment in Oldest Old</h4></p>\n<p>Though the use of AHD treatment for cognitive impairment seems promising based on previous research, one major limitation of HAAS, GEMS, and the study by Kan et al. is the lack of information regarding participant blood pressure before, during and after treatment. The studies focused on the type and duration of AHD treatment and participants\u2019 cognitive scores assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), but changes in individual blood pressure pre and post AHD treatment as well as variations in blood pressure trajectories between subjects were not examined (3, 4, 5). Because blood pressure trajectories vary across age, gender and in the presence of illnesses (6), failure in collecting this data possibly led researchers to overgeneralize or misinterpret the effects of AHD treatment for all hypertensive patients.</p>\n<p>In fact, recent studies show that AHD treatments can actually harm a subgroup of the elderly. In this context, Mossello et al. (2015) investigated the effects of AHD therapy on hypertensive patients 85 years and older with baseline dementia or mild cognitive impairment. In contrast with Kan et al. (2013), researchers found low daytime systolic blood pressure associated with a greater progression of cognitive decline among those treated with AHDs (6). Additionally, individuals with higher systolic blood pressure had milder cognitive decline compared to those with lower systolic blood pressure and that this effect was greater for individuals with severe disabilities at baseline (6). These findings are consistent with those of the Leiden 85-Plus Study (2012) which found that higher systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure in the oldest old (85+ years) positively correlated with greater resilience to physical and cognitive decline, especially in individuals with pre-existing physical disabilities (8). Researchers postulate that, contrary to traditional medical belief, high blood pressure in later life serves as a compensatory mechanism to maintain organ perfusion (8) whereas low blood pressure leads to cerebral hypoperfusion that can damage neural tissue and increase the risk of dementia (7). The primary causes of low blood pressure are attributed to heart failure and/or drug treatment (7), but the spontaneous lowering of blood pressure is a pattern typically observed in older `individuals before the onset of dementia (6). Thus, for older patients with baseline cognitive impairment or physical disabilities, excessive blood pressuring lowering via AHD treatment may not only be ineffective in preventing dementia but also harmful to their cognitive health (6).</p>\n<p>These studies (6, 7, 8) provide evidence of the limitations of AHD treatment for preventing dementia and emphasize the importance of measuring blood pressure and screening for pre-existing cognitive impairment before issuing AHD treatment. Additionally, the close monitoring of blood pressure during treatment is also equally as important. A daytime systolic blood pressure between 130 to 145 mmHg has been classified as the most appropriate therapeutic target of AHD treatment (6) where excessive blood pressure lowering (below 130 mmHg) may lead to negative outcomes (7).</p>\n<p><h4>AHD Treatment in Middle-Aged</h4></p>\n<p>Though AHD treatment has been shown to be ineffective and potentially harmful for older patients with cognitive impairment, several studies suggest its effectiveness for middle-aged hypertensive individuals. Gottesman et al. (2014) recruited hypertensive 50 year-old females and observed the effect of AHD treatment on their blood pressure trajectories biannually for 20 years. After two decades, researchers found that women with elevated blood pressure in midlife who received AHD treatment had better episodic memory than those who did not (9). Similarly, study by Joas et al. (2012), which assessed AHD treatment in Swedish women at a 37-year follow up, found that among hypertensive women without AHD treatment at midlife, higher baseline systolic blood pressure was linked to late-life dementia, especially AD (10).</p>\n<p>Additionally, women with higher baseline systolic blood pressure who were treated with AHDs had the least cognitive decline, supporting claims of higher blood pressure in old age as a neuroprotective factor, which may have buffered the effects of excessive blood pressure lowering from over treatment (8). Furthermore, and consistent with the study by Mossello et al. which emphasizes the importance of baseline blood pressure in determining the efficacy of treatment, Joas et al. found that among those who were treated with AHD, women who developed dementia had lower baseline systolic blood pressure compared to those with higher baseline systolic pressure. Because blood pressure decreases spontaneously before the onset of dementia and is lower in individuals who manifest dementia compared with those who do not (6), AHD treatment may only be effective for those with extremely high blood pressure (9). Individuals at risk for hypertension may not benefit from AHD treatment as much those with extreme hypertension and may be better off reducing their risk of dementia with lifestyle modifications (10).</p>\n<p>These findings emphasize the importance of detecting increased blood pressure in midlife and controlling blood pressure in those treated in efforts to maximize treatment benefits and prevent dementia in later life. Antihypertensive treatments have been shown to be successful in mediating the effects of midlife hypertension in individuals with higher systolic blood pressure, but less so in individuals with lower baseline systolic blood pressure, who may benefit more with lifestyle modifications.</p>\n<h3 data-fontsize=\"15\" data-lineheight=\"20\"><h4>Future Directions</h4></h3>\n<p><h4>Implications for Future Research</h4></p>\n<p>Because most studies of AHD treatment are observational, further randomized clinical trials are needed to determine causality (3), especially in populations at high risk for cognitive decline. In addition, increasing the duration of follow-up in longitudinal studies and frequency of blood pressure monitoring may provide us with a more holistic understanding of the relationship between blood pressure trajectories and cognition as they change with age (2). Also, variations in blood pressure trajectories across age, gender and the presence of illness emphasize the importance of homogenizing participant pools to differentiate the effects of AHD treatment on the basis of these factors (5). Furthermore, future studies investigating the biochemical mechanisms behind low blood pressure and cognitive impairment may guide pharmaceutical scientists and developers to make appropriate modifications to AHDs in hopes of increasing their efficacy (1).</p>\n<p><h4>Implications for Clinical Practice</h4></p>\n<p>Due to the negative relationship between low blood pressure and cognition, physicians should carefully consider blood pressure fluctuations and screen for signs of cognitive impairment before issuing AHD treatment to older patients (3). In addition, close blood pressure monitoring may be necessary to avoid high blood pressure overtreatment, if at all, in this population6. Lastly, given that individuals at risk for hypertension are currently not candidates for pharmacological interventions, doctors should encourage these patients to adopt lifestyle changes in an effort to reduce their risk of developing hypertension and of cognitive impairment (10).<br/>\n<h4>Conclusions</h4></p>\n<p>AHD treatment seems to be effective in preventing the onset and reducing the progression of dementia, but only for middle-aged hypertensive individuals with no baseline cognitive impairment. Several longitudinal studies such as HAAS and GEMS demonstrate the potential of AHDs in reducing dementia in the elderly but their lack of blood pressure records make their findings hard to generalize across different populations (3,4) because blood pressure trajectories vary across age, gender, and in the presence of disease (8). Additionally, the importance of monitoring blood pressure was evident in a study that isolated the oldest old (85+) from other hypertensive individuals in the assessment of AHD efficacy, in which low blood pressure, baseline dementia and physical disability were associated with greater cognitive decline in conjunction with AHD treatment (6). Furthermore, an increase in blood pressure in middle age was classified as the biggest predictor of late-life dementia (10), whereas higher blood pressure exhibited a neuroprotective effect in older individuals (7,8). Though further research on specific populations is needed, targeting midlife hypertension while closely monitoring blood pressure seems promising in the prevention of dementia.</p>\n<p><h4>Image Source</h4>\u00a0http://www.torange.us/Objects/medicine/blood-pressure-control-19165.html</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Ferri CP, Prince M, Brayne C, Brodaty H, Fratiglioni L, Ganguli M, et al.

Fatigue and muscle weakness is something that today\u2019s working population has learned to ignore, and this has prevented MG from early detection. Proper treatment is necessary for this potentially life-threatening condition.\u00a0I decided to write about this topic after reading a case study for one of my internships. I hope the readers will look out for signs like the drooping of eyelids, muscle weakness, and difficulty in swallowing for the early detection of this rare autoimmune disease.\u201d</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-716\"></span></p>\n<p>Myasthenia gravis (MG), \u201cgrave muscle weakness\u201d in Greek, is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disease in which the body\u2019s defense mechanism goes awry and attacks its own cells. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, patients with MG complain of varying degrees of worsening muscle weakness in different parts of the body, such as in one or both eyes, face, or limbs. If the condition affects respiratory muscles, it can cause airway obstruction, which can lead to a life-threatening situation called myasthenia crisis (2015). Understanding MG\u2019s mechanism of action, symptoms, and diagnosis can vastly improve the prognosis of this disease.</p>\n<p>Usually, our immune system protects us from foreign elements that enter our bodies by creating \u201csoldiers\u201d called antibodies to destroy these elements. During human development, these antibodies undergo a kind of orientation wherein they are trained to recognize self from nonself proteins. A selection process at the end of this session eliminates the antibodies that react strongly with self proteins (Berg 2002). However, in rare cases such as MG, the immune system fails to successfully undergo this process and produces antibodies against its own cells, causing autoimmunity (NLM 2015).</p>\n<p><a data-caption=\"\" href=\"http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2016/03/bhatt.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-718\"><img alt=\"Bhatt\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-718\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"233\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" src=\"http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2016/03/bhatt.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2016/03/bhatt-300x148.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2016/03/bhatt.png 760w\" width=\"474\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:right\"><em>Picture Courtesy of MA</em></p>\n<p>The autoimmunity in MG affects the receptors in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), or the space between nervous cells and the muscles they control. As the nerve impulse travels down a normal neuronal cell, it communicates by releasing acetylcholine (ACh), a chemical messenger called a neurotransmitter, into the NMJ. ACh then binds to complementary receptors called acetylcholine receptors (AChR) on the adjoining cell. Upon the binding of these chemicals at the receptors, a desired effect is produced, which can lead to further propagation of the impulse to another neuron and eventually cause muscular movement. In MG, the body\u2019s defense system, which usually produces antibodies against foreign elements, makes antibodies against its own cells that bind to cell-specific receptors. This prevents the binding of ACh to the receptors as shown in the figure and leads to their further internalization and subsequent degradation. Consequently, the message is not passed from the cell, resulting in either weakened or no muscle contraction (NINDS 2015). It is, therefore, of prime importance to detect the symptoms resulting from the reduced availability of these receptors at the NMJ for a better prognosis.</p>\n<p>MG can be difficult to diagnose definitively, as its initial symptoms are similar to other plausible autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the patient\u2019s symptoms should be analyzed for an accurate MG diagnosis as, in most cases, the onset of the disorder is sudden and is not always a tell-tale myasthenia gravis case. MG is characterized by the decay in muscle strength after use and improvement upon rest. The first noticeable symptoms include the drooping of eyelids (ptosis) and double vision (diplopia). Generalized myasthenia, or weakness all over the body, develops in patients within three years if they initially experience trouble with ocular (eye) muscles (Rubin 2014). Additional symptoms include an unstable gait, a change in facial expression, difficulty chewing and swallowing, shortness of breath, and weakness in the limbs, fingers, and neck. While the symptoms are usually well managed and patients can live comfortably, early detection is key because it can prevent the condition from exacerbating (NINDS 2015).</p>\n<p>One of the preliminary ways to diagnose MG is to check for disruption in eye movements or muscle strength. These changes in eye movement and muscle strength can occur without altering the patient\u2019s sensitivity to touch. This occurs because MG is an isolated neuromuscular disease, a disease that does not affect any other system like the sensory system. A more quantifiable way of diagnosing is performing a special blood test to detect AChR antibodies in the blood sample. This test is of high validity, as 80-90% of patients with generalized myasthenia gravis test positive (Rubin 2014). Moreover, the specificity of this test significantly decreases in the absence of ocular symptoms. In another test called electromyography, a repetitive electrical impulse is given to the affected muscle. In 60% of the patients with myasthenia gravis, the muscle response will dissipate over time; that is, the patients\u2019 response to the electrical stimulus will lessen progressively (Rubin 2014). Occasionally, another test is performed during which a drug called edrophonium is administered. If a patient is positive for MG, edrophonium relieves activity-induced muscle fatigue. Nonetheless, this result can be seen in patients with other neurological conditions as well, or if performed in patients without droopy eyelids. A follow-up CT or MRI scan should be performed to check for thymus enlargement, a condition called thymic hyperplasia, prevalent in 65% of MG patients (Rubin 2014). While doctors can utilize various tests to diagnose MG, these tests may provide non-specific results, and thus, more than one test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.</p>\n<p>It is estimated that only 1 in 5,000 Americans are affected by MG, but the actual number may be higher due to the fact that many individuals may be undiagnosed until they reach advanced stages (Juel and Massey 2007). Even though the disease can occur at any age and to anyone, it is more common among women under 40 and men above 60 years of age (NINDS 2015). It is, therefore, essential to have an unambiguous early diagnosis in order to follow-up with proper treatment, as the condition may eventually affect the respiratory muscles, causing airway obstruction.</p>\n<p>While there is no known medication for treating the autoimmunity caused by the immune system attacking the ACh receptors, drugs that help manage symptoms are typically prescribed. A class of drugs called anticholinestrase helps relieve symptoms by increasing the duration and availability of ACh in the NMJ and preventing its enzymatic breakdown by acetylcholinestrase. Additionally, steroids are prescribed to suppress the patient\u2019s immune system, reducing the production of antibodies that might target patients\u2019 own cells. However, when taking steroids, caution has to be taken because the patient becomes more vulnerable to other garden variety diseases like the common cold and strep throat, which are otherwise preventable by an intact immune system. Finally, a procedure called thymectomy, or the surgical removal of the thymus gland, can be performed, and it has shown both permanent and temporary improvement in 80% of the cases of MG (Rubin 2014).</p>\n<p>Even though MG is a potentially fatal autoimmune disease, it is not as \u201cgrave\u201d as it used to be. The latest technological advancements in diagnoses and treatments has made the term \u201cgravis\u201d redundant or unnecessary in MG, with patients having a normal life expectancy after appropriate care (NINDS 2015). Since the symptoms are similar to many other neurological disorders like muscular sclerosis and muscular dystrophy, emphasis should be given to early and accurate diagnosis for effective disease remission. In my opinion, individuals should undergo at least two tests to accurately confirm MG and avoid a false positive. An AChR antibody test could be used, since it is an indicator of an autoimmune disease, and an electromyography test could be administered, since it indicates a neuromuscular disorder. This condition is a good example of how our defense systems can malfunction and cause serious damage to the functioning of our bodies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Work Cited</p>\n<p>Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L. 2002.

While I was writing this piece, I recognized just how little time non-athletes spend thinking about the impact of sports injuries. Many NCAA athletes have life-long sports injuries, but we rarely talk about this issue as a campus community. There\u2019s a national discourse revolving around injury prevention in football, and I believe this is a topic college students (athletes and non-athletes alike) should be thinking critically about.\u201d</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-730\"></span></p>\n<p>On a sunny October afternoon in 2012, Coolidge Evans, running back for an NCAA Division I football team, stepped on the field with a smile on his face. His team had traveled to South Dakota to play South Dakota State, and he was starting for the first time. A football player since the age of 6, Coolidge was always in tune with the vibe of the field before a game. On this particular day, he could tell he was about to <em>\u201cgo off</em>\u201d. \u201c\u2018Go off\u2019 basically means I had full composure and control of the game,\u201d Coolidge explains.</p>\n<p>A sophomore at the time, Coolidge was excited to play well and make his parents (who had traveled from California to see him) proud. The players were running the spread offense, which is Coolidge\u2019s favorite play. He had experience with this play in high school, so he knew exactly what he needed to do. Coolidge knew that the defense was aggressive and would act on quick assumptions, so he successfully tricked the defense by going left and breaking into the open field ahead of him. The safety tackled him as he was running, and he fell to the ground. \u201cI was moving the ball but then I was like \u2018Ah, this is all bad,\u2019\u201d Coolidge recalls. Instead of bracing for the impact, Coolidge relaxed his body as he came down to the ground.</p>\n<p>Lying on the ground in a state of shock, Coolidge couldn\u2019t feel anything. He was on the ground for all but a couple of seconds, though, and found that he could get up without any help. He told the physical trainers on the sideline that his shoulder didn\u2019t feel normal. He wanted the trainers to cut through his jersey and remove his shoulder pads to get a good look at his shoulder. The physical trainers refused, despite the fact that his shoulder was clearly causing him pain. The trainers gave Coolidge some painkillers and he sat out for the rest of the game. Coolidge left the field to shower and put his arm in a basic sling. He was later given ice for his shoulder. He was in pain on the bus ride from the stadium and on the flight home. \u201cSleeping on that plane was the most uncomfortable sleep I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Coolidge recalls.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Coolidge had injured his acromioclavicular (AC) joint during the game. The AC joint is located between the clavicle and the scapula. While the AC joint is strong, its location makes it vulnerable to injury from direct trauma (Koehler et al. 2015). The muscles that attach to the bones in this region rotate, flex, and extend the arm. In American football, shoulder injuries account for 10% to 20% of all musculoskeletal injuries, and in a cohort of intercollegiate football players, AC joint injuries accounted for 41% of all shoulder injuries (Lynch et al. 2013). The prevalence of these injuries comes as no surprise; football players are constantly tackled on the field and are given little time to recover, and these injuries are diagnosed and treated with a nonchalance that is quite commonplace in the field of athletics.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>When he returned home, Coolidge realized just how much he needed his shoulder for daily tasks. Showering, wearing a backpack, and driving his manual car proved to be difficult with his impaired shoulder. Coolidge accommodated for this by using his good arm. Physical trainers said he had a third-degree AC separation, but that he would be fine. \u201cIn football language, \u2018fine\u2019 means \u2018good enough to play,\u2019\u201d Coolidge clarifies. A third-degree AC separation refers to the complete dislocation of the joint between the shoulder blade and collarbone, an injury so severe that it can result in a permanently deformed shoulder.</p>\n<p>Before heading out to practice, Coolidge would get an air cushion taped around his shoulder and his shoulder pads would be placed on top. The physical trainers recommended that Coolidge do weekly physical therapy, but he felt like they were downplaying his injury. He was still in pain, but for a month and a half, he tried to convince himself that he was okay.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>If a player\u2019s injuries are not properly treated, players might have to face the physical and mental burden of dealing with serious complications. Dr. Danielle Campagne, an emergency medicine physician, states that these complications may threaten life or limb viability or cause permanent limb dysfunction (Campagne, 2014). This may sound overly dramatic for a fairly common sports injury, but failing to let an injured joint properly heal can greatly increase the risk of permanent damage. Joint injuries can disrupt neurovascular structures in the body. Blood vessels and nerves from the hand and arm drain into a main artery and nerve plexus (respectively), both of which are located in the shoulder region, so an injury in this area can be especially debilitating. Long-term complications can result in general joint instability, torn ligaments, or fractured bones. In most cases, a physical examination will be done, x-rays will be taken of the affected area and, if the injury is deemed mild, the patient will be sent home with a list of rehabilitative arm exercises. In more serious cases, an MRI scan will be administered and surgery may be necessary.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>One weekend, Coolidge flew to Los Angeles and got an MRI scan through his personal physician. The MRI scan confirmed that he had a torn labrum in addition to the third-degree AC separation. A labrum tear refers to a rupture of the cartilage that stabilizes the shoulder joint, and it is a common injury for athletes who engage in tackle sports. His shoulder was, as athletes call it, \u201cblown\u201d. He returned to campus and showed the physical trainers his MRI results. They agreed that surgery was necessary. Throughout December of that year, Coolidge did not train with the football team, but instead took time off to let his shoulder heal.</p>\n<p>Coolidge went in for shoulder reconstruction surgery the following January. The ligament of his left clavicle bone and the tendons of his left bicep were reattached to his scapula. His torn labrum was reattached to his shoulder socket with sutures. He was prescribed Vicodin for the pain and his healing shoulder was encased in a heavy duty sling for four months. Two months after the surgery, he began daily rehabilitative exercises. He continued to do physical therapy with an athletic trainer for the rest of the year.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Anywhere from 11% to 81% of student athletes will sustain an injury over the course of their football careers (Dragoo et al. 2012). Only 3.6% of AC joint injuries are diagnosed as severe enough to require surgery. In a retrospective study that assessed the pathology of AC injuries in NFL players, orthopedic surgeon Dr. Bryan Kelly states, \u201cSurgery has rarely been necessary. We have treated several NFL quarterbacks non-operatively.\u201d Dr. Kelly does go on to mention that more serious cases will need surgical treatment (Kelly et al. 2004). Surgery and post-operative care are both time-intensive and costly. The process can be emotionally jarring for student-athletes specifically, many of whom want to simply get playing time on the field. Recovering from a severe injury can also affect other aspects of a student-athlete\u2019s life; balancing academic responsibilities in addition to physical rehabilitation may prove to be too much to handle.</p>\n<p>In more recent years, there has been a bigger push to prevent football players from having to deal with the physical pain and mental burden of injuries. Researchers have analyzed extensive databases containing injury diagnoses of NFL and NCAA athletes. In a study that assesses data from the NCAA Injury Surveillance System, Dr. Jason Dragoo and his colleagues found that rates of AC joint injuries are 11 times greater during football games than during practices (Dragoo et al. 2012). The study posits that game conditions are less predictable and produce heightened speeds and intensity, which contribute to an increased risk of injury (Dragoo et al. 2012). Reevaluating how players train and how injuries are treated might lead to a lower incidence of these severe injuries occurring during games. Results from injury prevention trials in other sports show that a structured and progressive warm-up can help prevent general sports injuries, but there is a lack of research that assesses the effectiveness of this training tactic in football specifically (Kirkendall et al. 2010). As far as treating joint injuries, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons suggests that the player must have no pain, no swelling, a full range of motion, and normal strength before returning to play (AAOS 2013).</p>\n<p>Football players look practically superhuman on the field. That\u2019s why fans enter stadiums in droves to support their favorite players. Unfortunately, many fans do not know how common it is for players with sustained injuries to continue playing when they shouldn\u2019t. Football players might seem indestructible, but it is crucial to remember that, even in all their might, they have very vulnerable and fragile bodies.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>By the end of the year, Coolidge felt like he had fully recovered. He remained on the team and continued playing football for two more years. Now, at twenty-two and still as athletic as ever, Coolidge appears to be in good health. When asked what triggers his shoulder pain he pauses for a moment and mumbles, \u201cThinking about it triggers the pain.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t even like touching the scar. When asked if he feels like his shoulder is back to normal he responds, \u201cNo, but it\u2019s a new normal.\u201d</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<p>[AAOS] American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.

I chose the topic of transgender medical treatment outcomes because of the recent increase in transgender inequity in the media. In the last 10 years, with the emergence of World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), there has been an increase in studies and resources available to clinicians. This emergence, while promising, is new and few clinicians feel comfortable treating these patients. This paper focuses on the outcomes of treatment on the wellbeing of patients struggling with gender dysphoria (GD). I originally chose this topic because of my connection with several transgender individuals. I was also curious as to what could be done to alleviate GD because I had heard about the prevalence of mental disorders and suicide rates among these patients. I do not focus on the treatments themselves in my literature review but on the wellbeing of the patient after receiving treatment. I thought that this was the important emphasis because the overall goal of these treatments is\u00a0to improve the wellbeing of the patient.\u201d<span id=\"more-819\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p>Individuals experiencing gender dysphoria (GD) have a marked incongruence between their assigned and experienced gender, resulting in great distress<sup>1</sup>. Issues, such as transgender bathroom policies, are exposing transgender rights to the mainstream media, highlighting this population\u2019s lack of equity. Social marginalization can cause high rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide in this population<sup>2</sup>. In addition, barriers to health care leave these individuals at high risk for negative health outcomes<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>GD is accompanied by a desire to transition to an individual\u2019s gender identity<sup>1</sup>. An increasing number of gender nonconforming youth are seeking medical intervention, yet in many cases few providers feel educated about and comfortable with treating these patients, making this population vulnerable<sup>2,4</sup>. There are guidelines for transitioning developed by respected organizations, such as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society<sup>4</sup>. These guidelines, which were developed after conducting clinical and academic research, are meant to guide clinicians to provide evidence-based medicine for their transgender patients, but it is important to note that there is not a universal consensus within the medical community<sup>4</sup> . There is disagreement among clinicians on whether the risks of transitioning or withholding treatment result in worse outcomes<sup>4</sup>. The purpose of this literature review is to analyze the benefits and risks of medical intervention to the wellbeing of patients experiencing GD in order to provide guidance to general practitioners. This literature review will first discuss the eligibility for beginning the transitioning process, followed by the outcome of\u00a0 the medical stages of transitioning, and finally, the risks associated.</p>\n<p><h4>Eligibility</h4></p>\n<p>To be eligible for treatment in the following studies, patients must meet the standards established by WPATH<sup>5</sup>. These standards include a presence of GD that is intense and long lasting, an increase in GD when beginning puberty, an absence of any mental or physical problems that would affect treatment, and patient consent contingent on parental support<sup>5</sup>. Each guideline is essential to providing accurate care for these patients. For example, it is important to wait until GD increases during puberty because GD in prepubertal children often desists, while GD in adolescents during puberty have high rates of persistence<sup>5,9</sup>. Another WPATH standard for transitioning is parental support, which was shown in a study to be linked with buffering mental health illness in adolescents with GD<sup>6</sup>. These factors are all necessary to ensure a positive transitioning experience<sup>5,8</sup>.</p>\n<p><h4>Medical Interventions</h4></p>\n<p><em>Puberty Suppression</em></p>\n<p>Puberty suppression can be used as both a diagnostic tool and a medically valuable treatment option for youth experiencing GD<sup>7,8,9</sup>. Puberty suppressors are drugs that prevent puberty from starting. Because puberty suppression tends to be fully reversible, it gives youth time to explore their gender identity while preventing their body from irreversibly changing during puberty<sup>7,8,9</sup>. It also makes surgery less redundant<sup>7</sup>. The following studies investigated the effects that puberty suppression had on psychological functioning and patient well-being after undergoing psychological support.</p>\n<p>A study that tested puberty suppression and psychosocial functioning compared two groups of adolescents experiencing GD<sup>8</sup>. In this study, psychologists and psychiatrists conducted clinical interviews, psychological assessments, and questionnaires in order to evaluate the effects of psychological support on GD adolescents<sup>8</sup>. In the group with adolescents eligible for puberty suppression, six months of psychological support did not improve their psychosocial functioning <sup>8</sup>. In contrast, the adolescents\u2019 psychosocial functioning significantly improved to levels equivalent to their\u00a0 peers without GD after being on puberty suppressants for 12 months<sup>8</sup>. The second group of adolescents had their puberty suppression delayed due to not meeting the WPATH standards<sup>8</sup>. This group improved in psychosocial functioning with psychological therapy, but there was no further improvement after six months, and they scored lower in psychosocial functioning than their GD peers even after 18 months of therapy<sup>8</sup>. Although psychological support improved functioning, puberty suppression is associated with further overall improvement and is argued to be an effective treatment for youth experiencing GD<sup>8</sup>.</p>\n<p>An additional study showed promising effects of puberty suppression by testing psychological functioning and well-being in 55 transitioning young adults<sup>9</sup>. Using questionnaires, participants were evaluated 3 times: before puberty suppression, at the introduction of cross-sex hormones (CSH), and at least 1 year after gender-reassignment surgery (GRS)<sup>9</sup>. Researchers in the study found that puberty suppression did not alleviate GD <sup>9</sup>. Puberty suppression does alleviate distress, but to fully remit GD, additional actions were required, such as CSH and GRS<sup>9</sup>.</p>\n<p><em>Cross-Sex Hormones and Gender-Reassignment Surgery</em></p>\n<p>Unlike puberty suppression, CSH and GRS are irreversible treatments<sup>10</sup>. CSH has a physical impact on both transmen and transwomen, eliciting changes that assist in presenting as their preferred gender<sup>10</sup>. GRS alters an individual\u2019s sex to resemble their experienced gender. The following three studies focus on different aspects of patient\u2019s well-being after CSH and GRS treatments.</p>\n<p>A study that included 55 young transgender adults with similar representation of transmale and transfemale participants, observed that GD was alleviated after the start of CSH and GRS treatments<sup>9</sup>. In this group, the patients who\u00a0 received treatment of CSH and GRS improved their body image satisfaction and psychological functioning to values similar to that of the general population<sup>9</sup>. These patients also showed particular improvement with anger, anxiety, and behavioral and emotional problems<sup>9</sup>. None of the participants regretted going through the transitioning process<sup>9</sup>. These results suggest that medical intervention may produce overall global functioning improvements for individuals experiencing GD.</p>\n<p>A defining aspect of GD is distress. A study was conducted to test the stress level in transsexual individuals before and after starting CSH therapy<sup>11</sup>. At the beginning of the study, patients with GD who had not received hormone therapy had high levels of stress, insecurity, and anxiety<sup>11</sup>. Before they began treatment, participants had their level of cortisol measured<sup>11</sup>. Cortisol is a hormone released in response to stress, and can be used to measure perceived stress. Cortisol level was measured by taking a blood sample one hour after waking up for three days and perceived stress was determined using a self-reported evaluation<sup>11</sup>. It was found that all participants had higher levels of cortisol and perceived stress before CSH therapy, compared to levels found in the general population<sup>11</sup>. Patients treated with CSH therapy for one year reduced their cortisol levels equivalent to the general population<sup>11</sup>. It was also found that patterns of stress, such as insecurity and anxiety, were alleviated<sup>11</sup>. The data suggests that patients benefited from CSH therapy<sup>9,11</sup>.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the studies previously mentioned that focused on short-term results, a long-term follow-up study assessed overall evaluation of participant\u2019s transitions, <sup>15</sup>. 71 participants first underwent a clinical interview, and then were required to fill out a separate\u00a0 follow-up questionnaire with periodic standardized questionnaires to keep a record of their changes over a long time frame<sup>15</sup>. The evaluations reported that using medical interventions reduced their GD<sup>15</sup>. Individuals reported high levels of well-being, with most employed, and sustaining satisfactory social lives<sup>15</sup>. The only common regret was wishing to have made the transition earlier in life<sup>7,9,15</sup>. It was found that most participants were in steady relationships and assessed their satisfaction with their relationships, on average 4.52 out of 5<sup>15</sup>. Similar results were found when evaluating friendships and relationships with their parents, which were 4.3 and 4.08 out of 5 respectively<sup>15</sup>.\u00a0 There were three main themes that researchers found in participants: they felt positive about their decision to pursue treatment, none wished to reverse their decision, and they overall had a high level of life satisfaction<sup>15</sup>.\u00a0 The long term effects of medial intervention seems promising for improving the wellbeing of individuals with GD <sup>4,15</sup>.</p>\n<p><em>Risk Assessment</em></p>\n<p>Due to the lack of abundant long-term studies on the risks of transitioning, there is some concern about long-term medical implications<sup>4,7</sup>. This section will review studies that investigated potential risks for individuals who pursue medical intervention.</p>\n<p>In a case report, a 22-year follow-up was conducted with a patient, B, a transman who began puberty suppression at age 13, and later followed up with CSH and SR<sup>7</sup>. At age 35, he presented a healthy blood pressure, height, weight, bone mineral density above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile, normal serum values for lipids and showed no signs of diabetes<sup>7</sup>. In this case report, there was no observed negative risk<sup>7</sup>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, since puberty suppression occurs during a time of major brain development, a study investigated the effects that puberty suppression has on executive functions to identify any risk associated<sup>12</sup>. They compared two groups of GD adolescents: one group treated with puberty suppression and the other group left untreated<sup>12</sup>. When data from the two groups were compared, the findings suggested that there is no difference in executive functioning of the patients<sup>12</sup>.</p>\n<p>This next study focuses on the effects of CSH. It analyzed the physiological effects of 106 individuals with GD treated with CSH<sup>13</sup>. It found that 2% of the participants developed erythrocytosis and elevated liver enzymes. Transmen did see a large increase in acne and hair loss due to the increase in testosterone from their therapy<sup>13</sup>. Despite some negative outcomes, overall data showed that CSH was effective and carries a low risk\u00a0 of side effects and severe negative outcomes<sup>13 </sup>. An additional report on CSH in transsexuals suggests that treatment is safe and there is low risk for osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer<sup>14</sup>. These findings predict that there is low short-term risk associated with transitioning, but clinical data for long-term risks is insufficient.</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p>With an increasing number of individuals presenting with GD, it is important to understand the outcomes of transitioning<sup>2,3</sup>. It appears that pubertal suppressants are a helpful aid for adolescents experiencing GD<sup>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15</sup>. Furthermore, CSH and GRS has been shown to alleviate GD<sup>2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15</sup>. While these studies show promising results, there is little data available on the long-term risks of treatments. Despite this, immediate risks of delaying treatment include depression, self-harm, and suicidality<sup>2,3,5,6,7. </sup>\u00a0While there may not be a consensus in the medical community, some professionals believe that withholding medical interventions for GD does more harm than good and can cause great distress and poor health outcomes<sup>4</sup>. As shown by the increase of transgender issues in the media, there is also little consensus by the public.</p>\n<p>Another aspect of healthcare that can improve GD patients\u2019 health outcomes is providing culturally competent care. Clinicians who care for these patients have a responsibility to provide medical care that is nonjudgmental and comprehensive. Being an ally is especially important for patients in this population, because they experience higher instances of health care inequity. The increase of the quality of life, coupled with the little known risk, suggests that medical intervention is a good option for patients with GD. To provide the best quality care, it is important that health care providers consult the Endocrine Society and WPATH guidelines when treating GD patients.</p>\n<table width=\"259\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"130\">Table 1.

While the topic is frequently in the news, the specifics of the virus are not always discussed in depth. As ongoing research is demonstrating the virus\u2019 possible links to human health disorders, it is important for the general public to be informed about the facts of the virus, in an effort to minimize its spread.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-822\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Recently in the U.S. and across the world, there has been growing concern regarding Zika virus, a pathogen primarily transmitted by the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Aedes </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">species of mosquito (CDC). Although infection with the Zika virus is generally only accompanied by mild symptoms, it has also been linked to microcephaly, a condition in which infants are born with abnormally small heads (Wilson, Schlagenhauf 1). As the number of people affected by Zika increases, further research is underway to look into Zika\u2019s role in other neurological disorders in an effort to discover other effects and conditions the virus might be associated with. Recently, there has been scientific consensus that Zika can cause Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that often begins with tingling and muscle weakness, and sometimes leads to paralysis (WHO). These new discoveries, in addition to the increased number of reported cases of the virus and new information regarding transmission, have led to greater worldwide interest in the virus. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in Uganda in the rhesus monkey, and has since been reported in many countries in Africa and Asia (Wilson, Schlagenhauf 1). More recently, it has been found in North, South, and Central America, in addition to many of the Pacific Islands (CDC). Within the past year, the virus received increased scrutiny, due to the discovery of its link to microcephaly. This responsibility for birth defects caused many people to regard the virus as being more severe than initially thought, as it can potentially lead to lifelong conditions for infants with mothers who are infected. \u00a0Additionally, the 2016 Olympic Games held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil further raised worldwide concern and greater recognition of the virus, as the virus has been reported in over 19 states in the country since its first local transmission in April of 2015 (Wilson, Schlagenhauf 1-2). Together, both the link to microcephaly and increased number of places reporting local Zika transmission led to increased media coverage of Zika, sounding an alert and encouraging prevention to people planning to travel to countries experiencing outbreaks. It appears that in the case of the Olympics, these attempts of prevention were successful, as the World Health Organization reports that there were no cases of Zika infections resulting from the Olympics (Tavernise). More recently, the U.S. also has experienced a Zika outbreak, with 43 locally acquired cases of the virus, all in Florida, and 3,314 travel-associated cases; and these numbers are rapidly growing (CDC). Zika has been declared a \u201cglobal public health emergency\u201d by the World Health Organization (BBC).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Symptoms associated with the virus are generally mild and often not detectable. Common symptoms include fever, rash, aches, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (an infection of the eye), and generally go away within a week (CDC). Less commonly, an infected individual may experience muscle pain and headaches (CDC). Due to the lack of severity of these symptoms, people may become infected and not realize it. While the symptoms are generally mild, it is still important for individuals to get tested for Zika, as more serious and lasting effects are possible. Its link to microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome are of particular importance, and there is currently further research being conducted to explore possible links to other neurological disorders (WHO). \u00a0This is especially pertinent to pregnant women, or women planning on getting pregnant, as many cases of microcephaly in infants born to women affected with Zika virus have been documented (CDC). Microcephaly results in a smaller head and brain size and can lead to infants having a variety of other medical problems, such as dwarfism, seizures, and facial and joint deformities (Wilson, Schlagenhauf 2). Additionally, several children also experienced learning disabilities, impaired motor function, struggles with balance and movement, and delays in speech (Boston Children\u2019s Hospital).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In addition to the increased number in identified viral infections and the virus\u2019 potential to cause birth defects, recent discoveries in its modes of transmission are also demonstrating the greater threat the virus may pose. While it was initially thought that this virus was only transmitted to humans from mosquitoes, new evidence suggests that human to human transmission can also occur. The ability of Zika to be transmitted through sexual intercourse increases public concern about the virus due to the effects that the virus can have on fetuses, and also because of the realization that people can contract the virus without ever coming into contact with a mosquito carrying the virus (WHO). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment available for Zika virus infection. Thus, it is very important for people, especially pregnant women, to take preventative measures against becoming infected. The use of insect repellants and clothing that limits exposure of body parts can be helpful in preventing mosquito bites. Additionally, it is very important for people to be aware of the areas that this virus is endemic and to either limit traveling to or take additional precautions when going to these areas. Finally, it is also imperative for people to take precautions regarding the sexual transmission of the disease, either by using condoms or by practicing abstinence. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Overall, it is very important for the general public to have full knowledge and awareness about this virus, in order to minimize its spread. \u00a0While the extent of the dangers attributable to this virus may not yet be fully understood, any instance of an emerging pathogen that threatens human health requires ongoing scrutiny. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Works Cited:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">MacMath, Jillian. \u201cZika in the US: Officials Announce over a Dozen New Locally Acquired Cases of Virus in Florida.\u201d AccuWeather.

Our assignment was to examine a health related research question and explore the subject in a quarter-long research and synthesis process. I decided to write about Schizophrenia because I realized that I knew close to nothing accurate about people with mental health illnesses. Lack of understanding of the disease can contribute to stigmatization of these patients and cause further psychological harm. On my way to demystifying Schizophrenia, one of the most researched relationship I found was that of Marijuana and Schizophrenia. Throughout this process, I not only gained valuable knowledge on this topic, but I also learned to appreciate the various methods scientists developed to study the mechanism of this multi-layered and abstract disease.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span id=\"more-879\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The high prevalence of Schizophrenic patients with the comorbidity of cannabis-dependency disorder prompted researchers to investigate the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia. The purpose of this literature review is to examine the current research on various factors that are significant in this association. The paper will look into retrospective studies that compare and contrast the two groups: schizophrenic patients with cannabis-dependency disorder and schizophrenic patients without cannabis-dependency disorder. Furthermore, I will examine studies that analyze the effects of cannabis on the cognition of adults with schizophrenia and cannabis-dependency disorder, as well as studies that explore the effects of cannabis on adolescents and its relation to schizophrenia. Significant factors found to be involved in this relationship are age, gender, genetic predisposition, and cannabis consumption behaviors.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Schizophrenia spectrum disorder is a debilitating chronic mental illness that alters one\u2019s emotional, psychological, and cognitive foundations. It gives rise to hallucinations, delusions, mania, reduced expression of feelings and pleasure, poor decision making skills, impaired working memory, and unusual thought content. Often times, schizophrenic patients acquire other illnesses, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression, bipolar disorder, multiple personality disorder, and drug addiction- the reason for which is another large topic of research. The cause of Schizophrenia is unknown and, as is the case for many mental illnesses, diagnosis relies on the appearance of particular symptoms. This questions the accuracy of the diagnostic criteria and demonstrates the lack of knowledge the medical community retains on this disease. Interestingly, schizophrenic patients present a median lifetime cannabis use disorder rate of 27.1%, as compared to the general population lifetime cannabis disorder rate of 10%. Cannabis-use disorder or cannabis-dependency disorder is characterized by an unhealthy pattern of usage of cannabis despite the harmful disturbances on daily activities and the consequences of physical and mental distress. This high correlation between cannabis and schizophrenia captures the attention of many researchers. In current literature, studies are conducted to answer three questions: (1) Does cannabis usage induce schizophrenia? (2) If so, is cannabis-induced schizophrenia a distinct disorder of its own? (3) Does the onset of schizophrenia draw patients to consume cannabis? My literature review will attempt to analyze in depth the most important factors involved in the relationship between schizophrenia and cannabis, as well as attempt to answer the three big questions in schizophrenia research today. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Retrospective Studies of Schizophrenic Patients with Cannabis-dependence disorder and Schizophrenic Patients without Cannabis-dependence disorder</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Comparing and contrasting the variables associated with the schizophrenic patients who are lifetime cannabis users and those who are not is a logical starting point to begin analysis of the role cannabis plays in schizophrenia. Helle et. al. (2016) considered the factors: family history of psychosis, gender, age of onset of Schizophrenia, and type of substance consumed. A large heterogeneous sample of 1,119 patients in the age range of 18-65 were drawn from three clinical sites in Norway. They were clinically diagnosed with Schizophrenia using the diagnostic test DSM-IV. This manual allows health professionals to take into consideration multiple factors and severity of the factors to diagnose patients effectively. Family history of psychosis, lifetime substance use, and age of onset of schizophrenia information were obtained through patient interviews. Age of onset of schizophrenia is determined by first psychotic episode, either reported by patients or determined by the patient\u2019s first visit to a clinical psychiatrist. Using information from interviews and urine samples, the participants were diagnosed with substance use disorders. The substance-use group included participants who abused, were dependent on, had lifetime registration of, or had positive results on urine tests for one of the following substances: cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, and opiates. The abstinent group never used any of these substances. A thorough comparison of the two groups revealed that there were more males in the substance group, 67.8%, as compared to the abstinent group of 53.5%. The substance group was comprised of younger participants with lower average years of education, and a shorter mean duration of illness. Cannabis is the only substance found to be significantly associated with the age of onset of Schizophrenia; approximately a three years earlier age of onset of psychotic symptoms is seen in schizophrenic patients who are cannabis-dependent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Sarzzazin et. al. (2015) conducted a similar study with more specific groups but fewer participants. The participants consisted of 171 schizophrenic patients from a hospital in France; they were grouped into \u201cPre-onset Cannabis-use disorder\u201d group (Pre-onset CUD) or \u201cNo pre-onset group\u201d (No Pre-onset CUD). Patients who stated that their usage of cannabis started at or before the onset of schizophrenia are in the pre-onset group and all other schizophrenic patients with co-morbidity of CUD were classified in the No Pre-onset CUD group. Through comparisons, it was found that the Pre-onset CUD group was predominately male (67.1%), however, there was no difference in the mean age of onset of schizophrenia (both 23.7 years of age) or difference in types and magnitude of symptoms or magnitude of symptoms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Mane et. al. (2015) compared and contrasted demographic, family history, symptoms, and gender in 119 first psychotic episode schizophrenic patients from ages 18-35 who were cannabis users and those who were not. First psychotic episode schizophrenic patients refer to those that have only experienced psychotic symptoms once. The patients in the cannabis-users group used cannabis at least weekly in the previous six months. Additionally, the participants filled out questionnaires specifying their reasons for cannabis use. There was no difference in symptoms found between cannabis users and non-cannabis users. However, cannabis users had an earlier onset of psychosis and were predominately male. The reasons for cannabis use in schizophrenic patients are largely to deal with hallucinations, suspiciousness, boredom, depression, or to alleviate medication side effects. This study supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia induces patients to seek cannabis usage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Helle et. al. and Sarzzazin et. al, examined factors that are difficult to determine correctly. The methods used to determine age of onset of schizophrenia and history of psychosis were based on patients\u2019 memory quality or on access to medical notes and interviews. However, asking patients to recollect information from memory is not very accurate. Inaccuracy \u00a0in methods may contribute to the discrepancy between Helle et. al. finding that cannabis increases onset of schizophrenia by three years and Sarzzazin finding no correlation between cannabis and age of onset of schizophrenia. Furthermore, there may be information about family history that researchers do not have records of. With these limitations in mind, all three studies found no difference in family history of psychosis between the two groups, suggesting that genetics do not play a role in the onset of schizophrenia. Additionally, there were no differences in demographic and clinical characteristics. This does not support the hypothesis that cannabis-induced schizophrenia is its own clinical entity. Helle et. al, Sarzzazin et. al, and Mane et. al. found that cannabis-using groups are most likely to be male and younger than the non-cannabis users. Relationships found in these studies could be identified as correlation and not causation because there is no clear cause-effect relationship examined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">While the previous studies mentioned in this literature review determined possible correlations between cannabis usage and schizophrenia, Kelley et. al. (2016) determined a causation relationship; in this retrospective study, marijuana use in the premorbid period was examined. A total of 247 English-speaking participants between ages 18 and 40 were used in this study. Marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco use were recorded based on how many joints, drinks, and cigarettes were used per month. Interviews were conducted with each patient and two other family members to determine the month of onset of psychotic symptoms. Subsequently, a precise number of the three substance used were determined in the period before psychotic symptoms began, the premorbid period, for each participant. The study found that certain behaviors during the premorbid period correlated with an increase in psychosis. Males, again, were found to be more prevalent in all substance groups. An increase in use of marijuana was associated with an increase in rate of psychosis. Daily use during pre-prodromal period approximately doubles the rate of progression to schizophrenia. Any increase in use during the premorbid period increases the rate of onset of schizophrenia. Specifically, escalation of marijuana usage in the five years premorbid period causes an earlier onset of schizophrenia. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The temporal link found between usage of marijuana and onset of schizophrenia shows that the usage of marijuana during the premorbid period is not the most important. Rather, the increase of dosage during that period is the most predictive of an earlier onset of schizophrenia. However, it is important to note that in this study, cannabis was found to increase the rate of onset of schizophrenia, not induce the onset of the disorder itself. This discovery explains the lack of difference found in age of onset of schizophrenia between pre-onset CUD group and no pre-onset CUD group in Sarzzazin et. al. Because the study did not take into account the amount of cannabis usage during the time before the onset of schizophrenia, no differences in the groups\u2019 age of onset were seen.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Effects of cannabis on Cognition of Adults with Schizophrenia</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The study conducted in Power et. al. (2015) classified schizophrenic patients into three groups: cannabis non-users (CN), cannabis- users (CU), and cannabis dependency (CD) and administered two cognitive assessment tests. The National Adult Reading Test Revised was used to assess the cognitive ability prior to illness onset and the Digit Symbol Coding Test assessed the patients\u2019 current cognitive abilities. Demographic and clinical differences between the groups were examined after accounting for confounding variables. No difference in the results of the tests was found between the groups, revealing that cannabis has no effect on the Intelligent Quotients of the schizophrenic patients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Risk-taking is an important function in executive cognitive abilities and correlates with one\u2019s ability to make decisions. People with schizophrenia and comorbid of cannabis dependence have been observed to possess altered risk-taking abilities. This study analyzes participants\u2019 risk taking abilities with a virtual lab experiment and two questionnaires. The Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) is a simulation where participants are to assess when to pump a virtual balloon, given caution to not pop the balloon. Money was given to the participants for each pump, but once the balloon pops, the money accumulated diminishes as well. The Risk Perception Questionnaire and the Self Mastery Scale allow the participants to analyze their own locus of control. Schizophrenic patients without cannabis-dependent disorder displayed the least amount of risk taking among the three groups. Patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring cannabis dependence have a unique pattern of risk taking that is intermediate between people with schizophrenia and people who are cannabis dependent. (Fischer, 2015)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">While Power et. al found that the intelligent quotient in adults are not affected by cannabis usage, the study in Fischer et. al. shows that there are cognitive differences between schizophrenic patients and schizophrenic patients with cannabis dependence disorder. The difference in cognitive results seen in the two studies might be because cannabis induces an effect on different cognitive domains of the brain, which are differentiated by the tests determining participants\u2019 intelligence quotient and the tests assessing participants\u2019 risk-taking abilities. The results from the two studies indicate a possible weak correlation between cannabis and cognition in schizophrenic patients. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Early Cannabis use Impact on Adolescent Brain</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Perhaps the most direct way to analyze cannabis\u2019 effects on people is a direct injection of cannabis into rats and then note the immediate results. In this experiment, Renard and her research team injected adult and adolescent rats with the psychoactive component in marijuana, delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol (THC). They observed whether the injection increased schizophrenic symptoms, as compared to control adult and adolescent rats with no injections. Willingness of the rats to interact with others determined the variable for social motivation and social cognition. Furthermore, anxiety behaviors were observed by examining rats\u2019 startle reflex to white noise and by placing rats in a box filled with light and observing the time it takes for the rats to leave the dark box and enter the light box because rats are naturally display adverse behaviors towards light. Neural recordings placements were also done to examine the frequency of neuronal firing in the brain. Lastly, the protein extraction was conducted. THC injected adolescent rats spent less time with stranger rats, traveled shorter distances, and made fewer transitions from dark to light boxes, as well as spent more time doing so. An increase in frequency of neuronal firing in adolescent rat and a hyperactive dopamine pathway were found. In adolescent rats, there was a significant decrease in phosphorylated proteins, while a significant increase in phosphorylated proteins was observed in adult rats. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Similarly, many studies have found cannabis to have an effect on neurological development of adolescents, especially during the spike of testosterone in adolescent boys during puberty. In French et. al, (2015), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to observe the effects of cannabis on adolescent brains during age 14 and 18. They observed the cortical thickness of the brain and the amount of gray matter present. Participants were separated into 2 groups based on a self-report questionnaire about whether or not participants have consumed cannabis in their life. Lower cortical thickness and lower amounts of gray matter were seen in males with higher polygenic risk score who consumes cannabis regularly, beginning at an age as early as 16. This correlation was not seen in females with high-risk scores or males with low risk scores.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">We can confidently conclude that adolescents are more sensitive to the effects of cannabis than adults. Not only do the behavioral changes seen in adolescent rats support the hypothesis of the significant effect cannabis has on the subjects, but the discovery of physically altered proteins through phosphorylation in the dopamine pathway further confirms this conclusion.Specifically, in human male adolescents who are genetically predisposed to schizophrenia and began usage of cannabis early in their lifetime, lower cortical thickness and a decrease in the amount of gray matter in the brain was observed. Both cortical thickness and gray matter are indicative of the cognitive functions of the participants. These studies provide solid evidence in support of the hypothesis that long-term exposure of marijuana in male adolescents may lead to neuropsychiatric-like symptoms such as anxiety, decreased social motivation and cognition, working memory dysfunction, and altered signaling pathways in the brain. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia still remains controversial. Understanding mental illnesses such as schizophrenia poses a challenge to health professionals because the symptoms cannot be easily measured and examined without relying on subjective accounts from patients. Despite lack of objective tools to examine factors involved in the association between cannabis and schizophrenia, researchers manage to conduct sound experiments, although each carry its own limitations. Retrospective analysis provided incongruous evidences of earlier onset of schizophrenia with cannabis-dependence disorder. However, when taking into account the specific amount of cannabis consumed in the prodromal period, it solidified a strong association between time of consumption and behavior of consumption to earlier onset of psychotic symptoms. While no difference in clinical symptoms were found between cannabis-dependence schizophrenic patients and schizophrenic users that were non-cannabis users, the larger amount of psychotic symptoms found in adolescent rats in comparison to adult rats provided a clue that age is an important factor to consider. More research on cannabis\u2019 effects on adolescent brains revealed that genetically predisposed adolescent males who consumed cannabis regularly had a higher likelihood of jumpstarting the onset of the illness. Current literature does not support cannabis-induced schizophrenia as a separate entity, but the hypothesis of using cannabis as self-medication was supported several times. From the evidence proposed, cannabis consumption does not directly cause the onset of schizophrenia, but well-conducted studies do suggest cumulative cannabis consumption in the premorbid period does induce an earlier onset of schizophrenia-like symptoms in genetically predisposed male adolescents. Specific effects of cannabis on human adolescents reinforce this association. More studies will need to be conducted to further explore if the relationship between cannabis and schizophrenia is actually a causation relationship and to provide insight for possible treatments and cures for Schizophrenia.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">References</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Fischer, B.F., McMahon, R.M., Kelly, D.K., Wehring, H.W., Meyer, W.M., Feldman, S.F., Carpenter, W.C., Gorelick, D.G.

This project taught me a lot about what we can do to help our patients get the most out of the clinic they go to. As you gain experiences in the medical field, think about the services your organization offers and how you can use your skills to enhance those services to the next level!\u201d</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-891\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Background</h4></p>\n<p>My Community HealthCorps experience at LifeLong East Oakland, a federally qualified community health center, can be described as a tale of two halves. During the first half, I accompanied Brigitte Peltekof, LifeLong\u2019s social worker, on home visits in the East Bay Area.</p>\n<p>I slowly learned to conduct an entire home visit by observing Brigitte. This entailed asking patients about the different social determinants of health\u2013 housing, income, transportation, caregiver support, and psychosocial history, to name a few. We then used this information to help patients access the health and social services they needed.</p>\n<p>Amassing patient interactions over 5 months gave me the confidence to pursue an independent project centered around home visits during the second half of my term. Without having worked out the details, I chose to make high blood pressure, or hypertension, the main focus of my project for several reasons. I primarily recognized its many eventual consequences, including damage to the arteries, brain aneurysm, and kidney failure. I hoped to raise awareness of high blood pressure\u2019s life-threatening effects to our hypertensive patients.</p>\n<p>My time at LifeLong leading up to the project also made me aware of the barriers patients face in coming to the clinic. By meeting patients where they live, my hope for this project was to make healthcare as accessible as possible for the patients involved.</p>\n<p><h4>Project Vision</h4></p>\n<p>I had three goals in mind when proposing this project. They are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To provide the panel of patients with blood pressure cuffs and encourage a greater level of engagement in their well-being by monitoring their blood pressure and exercising daily.</li>\n<li>To instruct patients about no-cost, easy-to-perform breathing and energy exercises intended to elicit the relaxation response via regularly scheduled home and clinic visits.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Evidence by Stahl et al. 2015 (in \u201cRelaxation Response and Resiliency Training and Its Effect on Healthcare Resource Utilization\u201d) states that \u201cmind body interventions can reduce individual disease burden as well as the utilization of healthcare resources and are well suited to the changing healthcare environment.\u201d</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>To reduce patient\u2019s\u2019 blood pressure readings by encouraging the integration of</li>\n</ol>\n<p>breathing and energy exercises into their daily lives.</p>\n<p><h4>Home Visits</h4></p>\n<p>I began visiting patients at the end of January once I received the shipment of blood pressure monitors and finalized an initial panel of patients. During our first visit, patients signed a consent form, were educated about the consequences of hypertension and guidelines for blood pressure numbers, and agreed to a list of responsibilities as part of their participation in this panel.</p>\n<p>Patients were provided with a blood pressure log at the beginning of each subsequent home visit to enter the date, time, and blood pressure recording, along with comments about how they felt and if they had taken their medication that day. The previous blood pressure log was collected and uploaded into the patient\u2019s medical record. I measured the patient\u2019s blood pressure during the visit and recorded it in the log.</p>\n<p>Home visits also entailed asking how the patient was doing. This led to conversations about the patient\u2019s family, home environment, level of physical activity, concerns about a medication\u2019s side effects, and more. Before leaving, I scheduled my next visit with the patients to increase the likelihood of maintaining regular visits.</p>\n<p>This project\u2019s initial focus was to parse out three breathing exercises during each home visit, so as to not frontload the patients with too much information at once. The breathing exercises are often utilized in yoga (including chair yoga), energy medicine, and meditation. Most patients discovered their blood pressure to be significantly lower after engaging in breathing exercises for 5 minutes. While some patients looked forward to learning a new set of breathing exercises during each home visit, some wished to focus their efforts on a select few.</p>\n<p>Patients who, at first, had only been interested in learning additional breathing exercises also started to utilize me as a health coach. They wanted to know when their next doctor\u2019s appointment was, how they could switch providers, whether they were taking their medication correctly, etc. They recognized the value of having someone from the clinic come to their home and took full advantage of my service. Some patients asked me to prepare a handout about diabetic neuropathy, come up with a week-long menu of health meals, help schedule a dentist appointment, and so on. Electronic versions of all handouts can be found at: http://tinyurl.com/HTNproject</p>\n<p>As a result, these home visits took an unexpected but welcoming change. I was now indirectly addressing hypertension by helping patients with their other chronic conditions and overall well-being. Considering that most patients on the panel, and the community in general, are alone during the day time, having someone to talk to and listen to them became refreshingly therapeutic.</p>\n<p><h4>Patient Q &amp; A\u2019s</h4></p>\n<p>During my penultimate home visit, I asked each patient twelve questions about this project. Patient interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Below is a paraphrased summary of the Q &amp;A. You will find the questions and assortment of answers provided by the patients at the end of this paper.</p>\n<p>Patient takeaways from this project included awareness about the importance of getting in a relaxed state of mind while taking their blood pressure. Deborah S. spoke of the stark difference between taking her blood pressure with the TV on and off. The latter allowed her to reach a more calm state, which resulted in a lower blood pressure reading. Jarvis J. reflected on the project as a life-changing experience that improved his other health conditions and uplifted his overall sense of well-being.</p>\n<p>Patients provided insightful suggestions on how this project could be improved. One suggestion was to go on a walk instead of having home visits, so as to provide patients with a change of environment. Linda S. suggested holding a monthly group meeting at the clinic so panelists could engage with one another and exchange successes and challenges.</p>\n<p>When asked about what advice she would give about blood pressure, Willie B. offered that blood pressure plays a significant role in affecting quality of life as one ages. Kris D. advised individuals to focus on taking care of themselves and keeping stress to a minimum. She admitted that making time for herself is something she needs to work on, but she recognizes how important it is in maintaining a healthy blood pressure.</p>\n<p>Most patients resoundingly wished their healthcare provider to know that this program should continue. I worked with patients who predominantly spend their time at home, alone. Home visits gave them an opportunity to socialize and talk to someone, which is powerfully therapeutic in itself.</p>\n<p><h4>Reflections</h4></p>\n<p>I have been deeply humbled by the patients I have had the honor of serving. I admire my patients\u2019 courage to own up to their health conditions and their willpower to commit to improving their health. I am moved by their openness to invite a stranger into their home again and again. Their vulnerability in sharing their fears, hopes, strengths, and successes inspires me. I have seen them grow into individuals who are more invested in taking care of their health and more knowledgeable about how to do so. By spending countless hours with them, I have become a better listener and patient advocate. I have experienced tremendous personal growth from hearing their incredible stories and helping them navigate through our healthcare system. I will carry the lessons I have learned from them throughout my medical career and beyond. I want to thank them for their hospitality, their time, and their willingness to change.</p>\n<p>By experiencing patients\u2019 inquisitive nature toward health-related topics and their need for assistance with navigating our healthcare system (making appointments, asking about referrals, etc.), I am convinced that this project should continue to exist.</p>\n<p>Patients who have someone that they can spend their time with in the community, without any significant time restrictions, receive a rich layer of individualized patient care and experience greater patient satisfaction. They are also more likely to utilize their clinic\u2019s services and be intrinsically motivated to pursue a better state of health.</p>\n<p><h4>Moving Forward</h4></p>\n<p>Based on the feedback from patients and agreement from LifeLong staff, I firmly recommend that a project like this become a commonplace feature of our clinics. Having Health Coach Volunteers would allow clinics to do just that. Better yet, all parties involved would benefit from such a program.</p>\n<p>Volunteers, who would mostly be future or concurrent applicants to medical and other health professional schools, would stand to gain an unparalleled experience working with the underserved on a 1-on-1 basis. They would have the opportunity to identify a patient panel and follow it over several months. Health coach volunteers would create patient education materials, shadow social workers and providers, and gain a strong letter of recommendation. Not only will their experience give them an edge in their applications to professional or graduate schools, but it also will deepen their understanding of how healthcare works and increase their maturity as they continue on their path to becoming future healthcare professionals.</p>\n<p>If you would like to implement a similar program at your clinic, do not hesitate to contact me at sharmaharsh91@gmail.com. I will be happy to provide you with the appropriate resources.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><h4>Extended Patient Q &amp; A\u2019s</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>What has motivated you to be a part of this project?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>\u201cBlood pressure issues. Newly discovered BP [blood pressure] issues.\u201d \u2013Susan B.</i></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Before I started doing home/clinic visits, what did you think this project would be like?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>\u201cI didn\u2019t really know. I just, um, was like \u2018hey, [they\u2019re] just trying to see\u2026\u2019 I was really wanting to learn things to help me de-stress my body and that was my main concern of how to get this blood pressure down. Because even though I went through a process of losing weight before, I still had high blood pressure. So, it wasn\u2019t just my weight, it was also the stress levels that I carry in my body.\u201d -Kris D.</i></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>When I started doing home/clinic visits, how did these expectations change? Was it for the better or worse?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>\u201cIt was for the better. I\u2019ve noticed that my BP has gone down. Like, the last time I checked it was like 121/79, which was never, ever the case. And I think that has to do with the fact that I started eating more vegetables, and taking time to jot down my BP, be more careful in doing the breathing techniques as well\u2026and turning off the TV while taking my BP. I think that\u2019s #1. Because before I would do it with the TV on and be more in tune with that and I think because I take time to just relax, breathe, and not have anything interfere helped.\u201d -Deborah S.</i></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Now that the project is coming to a close, how would you reflect on it?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>\u201cA life-changing experience. With the way my BP was, it was just a matter of time before I had a stroke or\u2026or something else could occur from it, but since I been in the program, all the testing that I\u2019ve been doing for other things that I\u2019ve been coming to the doctor for has just been beautiful. You know, I think my BP being kept at where it\u2019s supposed to be kept at makes the other things work even properly without even me knowing it, since I\u2019m not a doctor. But I can just feel the difference. You know, I\u2019m not walking around with my head just feeling heavy. Like if you touch it, your head\u2019s about ready to explode. You know, I was walking around like that for quite some time. And it was time for me to wake up and you guys woke me up to see that my life mattered.\u201d -Jarvis J.</i></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>How could this project have been better?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>\u201cWell, we could\u2019ve started the walking earlier. You know, going for a walk when I visit, we could\u2019ve started that earlier. But other than that, it\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s great. But I think I like the out visit more than I do the in-home like, you know going out walking with you and then going over the things\u2026because it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, you take it in better I think. Because when you\u2019re in home, you\u2019re just\u2026it\u2019s like okay, hurry up and finish. But walking the lake [Merritt] made it like, okay, you know, we gotta walk anyway, so why not talk and do, yeah.\u201d -Deborah S.</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cIf we had did it in a\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026group would be all right to see what other people is do- ing. Sitting around, talking about what can be done better. I\u2019d like to know if other people were benefiting, besides me with the program. If we got in a group, we could talk about it, and see what we could do better.\u201d -Linda H.</i></p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>What would make it easier for you or other patients to be compliant?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>\u201cBe serious about it. Everything that I\u2019ve done at the clinic, I\u2019ve taken as seriously. And I realize that everything that happens there, which has been, you know\u2026 given to me, has been a help.\u201d -Gloria R.</i></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>If you had to give patients who are in your shoes advice about BP, what would you tell them?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>\u201cThat eating actually is really\u2026you know, eating the right stuff, eating vegetables and exercising has a lot to do with your BP, too. So taking time out to do that. And, just make sure you eat right, exercise, and do breathing techniques. I didn\u2019t think the breathing techniques would work, but they do. They really put your mind at ease.\u201d -Deborah S.</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cI\u2019d tell em it was very important for them to know what their BP is because that\u2019s kind of determining what their quality of life is gonna be in the future.\u201d -Willie \u2018Delphine\u2019 B.</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cPay attention. Pay very close attention because it\u2019s something that can change, you know, without you being aware of it. That\u2019s why they call BP the silent killer.\u201d -Susan B.</i></p>\n<p><i>\u201cDon\u2019t stress\u2026don\u2019t stress. Stress is a silent killer and I\u2019ve been told that by a physician at LifeLong. Even though I\u2019ve been told that and I try not to stress\u2026I think once I get through my challenges of school and other things, I\u2019m gonna really work harder on taking care of me. And I told that to my daughter and a friend that I wanted to take more time, um, taking care of me now. Because I\u2019ve given my all to other things except for me, and I wanna make me feel better in the long run. I wanna feel better, I really do. Because stress is no joke. And then, on the 21st of May, my cousin died and, um\u202656 years old and he\u2019s gone now.

I should implement more fruits and vegetables, less fried foods, more baked foods or grilled foods. And cut out a lot of the pork and beef.

        "date": "02/17/2017",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">After researching Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) treatment methods for a UWP 104F assignment, I learned that current FXTAS therapeutics is limited to symptomatic treatment. Most articles emphasized the need to better characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying FXTAS development to develop drugs specifically for FXTAS. Therefore, I questioned what researchers currently know regarding molecular events that lead to FXTAS signs and symptoms and how this knowledge can aid in drug therapies. This motivated me to prepare a literary review, intended to educate and inform practicing clinicians, especially neurologists and psychologists, about recent findings and the future directions for FXTAS research. For this assignment, we were expected to synthesize recent articles and provide relevant information for clinical practice. Specifically, I wanted clinicians to gain a better understanding of a primary focus within FXTAS research\u2014molecular triggering events\u2014and importantly, how this research relates to clinical treatment of FXTAS.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1004\"></span><h4>I.</h4><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Discovered in 2001, Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) was identified as a late-onset, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, typically affecting males over the age of 55 (1). FXTAS is linked to a dominant mutation in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> gene, located on the X chromosome (1). This leads to higher disease penetrance in males\u2014approximately 45% in males compared to 16% in females. In the United States, more than 1 million individuals are impacted by FXTAS (2). Core clinical features of FXTAS include intention tremor, gait ataxia, cognitive decline and dementia, and these symptoms progressively become more debilitating throughout time. Unfortunately, a cure still remains unknown, and thus, advanced research continues, emphasizing the molecular processes that underlie FXTAS to pioneer drug development. Ideally, once molecular events are better characterized, therapies can be developed to specifically target those processes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At the molecular level, FXTAS affects carriers of a small mutation, also called a premutation, in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> gene. Normally, individuals have less than 55 CGG repeats in the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> gene, but premutation carriers have between 55-200 CGG repeats (1). This repeat expansion leads to increased levels of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA, yet decreased levels of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (3). Originally, studies suggested that the high levels of mRNA caused the symptoms of FXTAS. However, recently, a competing hypothesis has been proposed, involving a toxic protein produced by repeat-associated non-AUG translation (RAN). Therefore, this review will focus on describing these two leading toxic processes\u2014RNA-mediated toxicity and RAN protein toxicity\u2014to better characterize FXTAS pathogenesis and, ultimately, address therapeutic implications. This article will first discuss the molecular events involved in the disease, including the original hypothesis\u2014RNA-mediated toxicity\u2014 and the recent hypothesis\u2014RAN protein toxicity. Lastly, this review will examine therapeutic perspectives given our knowledge about these molecular processes.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Ii. Molecular Triggering Events</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">To advance therapeutics, FXTAS research capitalizes on understanding the underlying molecular processes that lead to FXTAS pathogenesis. Thus, this section discusses the two leading proposed molecular mechanisms that may lead to FXTAS signs and symptoms.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">RNA-mediated toxicity</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The earlier hypothesis investigates the unique molecular pathology of FXTAS. FXTAS patients and premutation carriers exhibit elevated </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA levels by as much as 10-fold, suggesting that regular transcriptional control is reduced (4-5). Importantly, the expanded CGG repeat in the mRNA transcripts excessively binds one or more proteins (6). However, by sequestering proteins, the proteins\u2019 normal cellular function is blocked and prevented, leading to functional deficiencies within the cell (6). These proteins include DNA repair proteins, transcriptional control proteins, and proteins involved in processing microRNAs (miRNA) (6). \u00a0Several of these \u201cRNA binding\u201d proteins bound to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA have been identified in the neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS\u2014ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions. Previous studies demonstrate that these inclusions may be positively correlated with clinical FXTAS symptoms (7). Therefore, identifying colocalized sequestered proteins attached to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA with ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions further validates and strengthens this model (5-6). Scientists first proposed that one or more of the aforementioned \u201cRNA binding\u201d proteins is/are acting to mediate the effect of abnormal mRNA levels, which cause FXTAS development. Sequestering these specific proteins leads to toxic RNA that may underlie the neurological impairment, cell loss, and brain atrophy in FXTAS patients (6-7).</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">RAN protein toxicity</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Recently, a competing hypothesis has emerged, involving unconventional translation, referred to as RAN translation. In this second post-transcriptional mechanism, \u00a0the expanded CGG repeat is included in the peptide product, either FMRpolyG or FMRpolyA, and results in either a polyglycine or a polyalanine stretch, respectively. This occurs because translation of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA begins at a point upstream of the expanded CGG repeat instead of at the expected AUG start codon (7). Typically, standard translation machinery would bypass the CGG repeat region, as it is located in the 5\u2019 UTR (1). However, RAN translation shifts the frame of the normal coding sequence. Interestingly, two possible shifts can occur during RAN translation and can recognize the expanded repeat sequence as either GCC, coding for glycine, or GCG, coding for alanine (7). Although both shifts occur, the shift resulting in a polyglycine-containing peptide, FMRpolyG, occurs at higher levels and has been found in intranuclear inclusions (7-8). Recent studies have demonstrated that the peptide product, FMRpolyG, is toxic to cells, causing proteins to misfold and aggregate (7-8). FMRpolyA products are also toxic, but the focus of research remains on FMRpolyG due its higher prevalence and co-localization with inclusions. Thus, it is more likely to participate in FXTAS pathogenesis. More importantly, however, the overall roles of RAN translation and these unexpected toxic peptides need to be further unraveled, as this research focusing on RAN translation is in its infancy. RAN translation adds another potential toxic mechanism, explaining how the expanded CGG repeat might manifest into the FXTAS clinical phenotype.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Iii.</h4><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><h4>Prospects for Drug Development</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Though there is no cure for FXTAS, further elucidation of the RNA- and protein-mediated toxicity mechanisms have opened new perspectives for drug development. Therefore, this section will examine different therapeutic directions and targets, considering the information gleaned through FXTAS research at the molecular level as described above.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Gene-targeted Therapy</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Because FXTAS is a genetic disorder, drug therapies ideally target genetic components contributing to the development of FXTAS, as employed through genome editing and gene silencing approaches. Genome editing explores the possibility of removing the expanded CGG trinulecotide repeat, which would address the core cause of FXTAS pathology. Essentially, it would correct the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> gene. However, this is still a futuristic approach because currently, there is no technology available to accomplish this in non-dividing cells, like neurons (9).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Contrarily, gene silencing techniques are available for patients participating in a clinical trial and are more actively employed for other microsatellite diseases, mainly Huntington\u2019s disease. Though gene silencing is currently being studied for patients with Huntington\u2019s disease, it can easily be adapted for use in FXTAS patients, who also suffer from a trinucleotide repeat disorder (10). This approach aims to silence the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> gene, eliminating toxic mRNA and FMRP. There is concern, though, because certain levels of FMRP need to be preserved for normal cognitive function. Similarly, therapy that targets the degradation of toxic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA experiences this fundamental conflict between removing toxic mRNA and maintaining sufficient levels of FMRP. Both gene silencing and degradation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA approaches have the capacity to prevent both RNA-mediated and RAN protein-mediated toxicity, but if </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA is completely degraded, no FMRP can be produced (9). The absence of FMRP is known to cause FXS (Fragile-X Syndrome) and therefore, this approach may not be beneficial for FXTAS patients and premutation carriers, as it could lead to another Fragile-X disorder (1). Instead, a modest reduction in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA levels may help the cell eliminate toxic RNA and RAN protein aggregates while preserving sufficient FMRP levels for cognitive activity (12).</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Protein-targeted Therapy</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Given recent findings, FMRpolyG is now also a therapeutic target due to its intracellular toxicity. In the cell, proteasomes mark FMRpolyG for degradation, yet simultaneously FMRpolyG inhibits this activity, blocking degradation and ultimately leading to its intracellular accumulation (7). Therefore, increased proteasome activity could prevent this toxic process (9). In fact, a recent study observed that increased proteasome activity led to degradation of toxic proteins, reduced aggregate formation and increased cell survival (11). This evidence suggests that elevated proteasome activity poses strong therapeutic potential. However, there are difficulties regarding the long-term toxicity of elevated proteasome activity and cellular adaptation leading to treatment resistance. Increased levels of protein degradation may be deleterious to cells. Therefore, it is critical to target a specific process in the protein degradation process, because this allows for higher regulation and control (9). Overall, this method may prove better suited to patients because it avoids the intrinsic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA and FMRP problem, unlike gene-targeted therapy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><h4>IV.</h4> \u00a0</span><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Primarily, there are two toxic mechanisms leading to FXTAS pathogenesis: RNA gain-of-function and protein gain-of-function. The RNA gain-of-function hypothesis consists of the sequestration of RNA-binding proteins specifically to the expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat region in the 5\u2019 UTR. This results in the lack of required proteins for tasks such as gene expression and mRNA processing, which are essential for proper cellular function (6-7). The protein gain-of-function hypothesis was recently explored due to further understanding of non-conventional RAN translation mechanisms. RAN translation incorporates the expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat in the peptide product, which was previously thought to be untranslated (7). This leads to toxic peptide products that are prone to misfolding and aggregating within the cell (7-8). Though presented separately, the RNA-mediated and RAN protein-mediated toxicity mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and, in fact, may have synergistic effects (7, 9). Thus, FXTAS pathogenesis would best be described as a two-hit model\u2014toxic RNA and toxic protein both may be critical for FXTAS development (7).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Although these two toxic mechanisms have been further characterized in research, there is no easy drug target for FXTAS treatment. Fundamentally, gene-targeted therapy\u2014mainly genome editing and gene silencing\u2014would prevent both RNA-mediated and RAN protein-mediated toxicity because it would target the root cause of FXTAS (i.e. expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat). However, this method is problematic. Both technologies remove or silence toxic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> mRNA, which leads to diminished levels of FMRP. Therefore, drugs specifically targeting RAN protein toxicity may be more sensible, since they would avoid the fundamental conflict between promoting </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FMR1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> degradation and preserving sufficient levels FMRP for cognitive function.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">FXTAS research has made tremendous progress in recent years and has helped advance drug development possibilities and avenues. However, further insight is needed to explore the role of RAN translation and the resulting toxic peptide, FMRpolyG, in FXTAS pathology. RAN translation has important implications for FXTAS patients and premutation carriers and may be a promising target for the development of drug therapies. The reported findings included in this review excite researchers to continue investigation to ultimately discover a standardized cure for FXTAS.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Works Cited</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Hagerman RJ, Leehey M, Heinrichs W, Tassone F, Wilson R, Hills J, et al.

Today, it is believed that one third of the world\u2019s population is infected with some form of TB. However, not many people truly understand what tuberculosis is or what it does. I hope that after reading this, you will have a better understanding of TB.\u201d</span><span id=\"more-1020\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Pathogenesis</h4><span style=\"font-weight:400\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">When TB was an epidemic in the United States during the early 1900\u2019s, many people nicknamed the disease \u201cconsumption\u201d because of how it \u201ceats you away.\u201d For those with active TB, some symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats and weight loss. Most cases of tuberculosis are caused by the bacterium, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. Although there are other </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Mycobacterium</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> species that cause TB, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> is the main causative agent. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">M. tuberculosis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">has many unique characteristics that make it stand out. A notable feature is the bacterium\u2019s thick, waxy, mycolic acid coating, which plays a vital role in its survival within the human body. Although most bacteria can survive for a few days on dry surfaces such as a tabletop, the waxy coat allows </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> to survive for weeks in a dry state. This also helps increase resistance to dehydration and chemical damage, which can prevent antibiotics from killing the organism (Lampart, 2002).</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> prefers to colonize in the lungs because it is highly aerobic; therefore it grows best in highly oxygenated areas. The lungs are responsible for allowing oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream, requiring it to be sterile. To retain sterility, the lungs have their own defense system to prevent and clear pathogens. An important component of this defense system is the alveolar macrophages, which detect pathogens and eradicate them. However, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> can easily evade the immune system by surviving and multiplying inside of these alveolar macrophages (Keane et al., 1997). The infected macrophages can only migrate to the nearest lymph node and hope that the bacteria will be contained by other immune cells.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><h4>Diagnosis</h4><span style=\"font-weight:400\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There are two methods commonly used to detect TB, but they are not 100% accurate and both methods have specific requirements. If a positive result is read, other exams are needed in order to determine if it is a true positive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">First is the purified protein derivative (PPD) skin method, which tests the inflammatory response against the purified tuberculin protein to see if the individual has previously been exposed to the bacteria. The test requires an individual to have a healthy immune system and to follow up with a healthcare professional 48 to 72 hours later to observe the inflammation response (Dacso, 1990). Although the PPD skin test is the most common due to its simple protocol, the results can be inaccurate if the patient has a poor immune system or if they are already vaccinated against TB.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The second method of detection is a blood test called the Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). Interferon gamma (IN\u03b3) is a cytokine, which is important for activating macrophages and performing other functions in the immune system. Similar to the PPD skin test, the IGRA tests for a specific response against the bacteria. This is to determine if the individual has previously been exposed to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. Although the IGRA is meant to be more accurate, the blood samples must be processed immediately, as any delay can lead to a false result.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">It is important to note that most people who are infected with TB don\u2019t get sick as long as the immune system is not compromised. These people are classified as having inactive or latent TB because the immune system and bacteria are at a standstill. The bacteria is controlled, but cannot be eradicated. People who are TB positive are often required to do an x-ray of the chest to test for active TB. In a patient with active TB, the chest radiograph shows 2-4 mm nodules throughout the lungs, which resemble bird seeds (Hussain et al., 2007). However, identifying </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">M. tuberculosis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> in a sputum sample is the true diagnostic test for TB.The main difference between active and inactive TB is that inactive TB is contained and is not spread around the lungs. When doctors look at the radiograph of someone with inactive TB, they look for the GHON (pronounced \u201cg-OH-n\u201d) complex, a lesion near the lymph node of the lung formed from the walled-off bacteria. For active TB, bird seed like nodules should be spread throughout the lungs.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4><span style=\"font-weight:400\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">TB can only be spread through the air or from the saliva of an individual who is already infected with active TB; individuals with inactive TB are not contagious. However, even if the bacteria is contained in people with inactive TB, there is a slight chance that reactivation can occur. Therefore, people with active or reactivated TB are often those with compromised immune systems. Such cases are common in patients who are Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive and in those who use steroids. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There are several antibiotic treatments to control the disease. If active TB is found, the patient is often put on several antibiotic treatments for 5-6 months. Healthcare professionals stress that treatment must be administered properly to prevent drug-resistant bacteria from appearing. The misuse of antibiotics allows surviving bacteria to reproduce and drug-resistant bacteria to adapt, making antibiotics useless. In order to prevent future drug-resistant TB from appearing, it is our responsibility to be educated and to educate others about the risks of improper usage of antibiotics.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Takeaway</h4><span style=\"font-weight:400\">:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tuberculosis is fascinating and has an immense amount of significance in today\u2019s world. In summary, TB is a bacterial infection of the lungs that many people are able to resist unless the immune system is compromised. The PPD and IGRA tests check for previous infection of TB. However, only an x-ray exam of the chest or a culturing of bacteria is sufficient to diagnose for TB. There are treatment options for active TB, but they must be applied properly to prevent drug-resistant bacteria from evolving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">References:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Dacso, C.

As this is a disease that affects such a wide variety of people, and currently has no cure, I wanted to educate myself about the developments regarding it. Although the potential treatments are still under investigation, they provide hope for people affected by a currently incurable disease.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1111\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a terminal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline. As the most common cause of dementia, AD affects over 24 million people worldwide, and this number is only expected to increase due to greater life expectancies (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Although this disease affects a great number of people, there is currently much that remains unknown about it, particularly the causes and potential treatments. While there seems to be a consensus among researchers and clinicians that the disease is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid plaque accumulation in the brain, their causes and implications are still under investigation (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2-5)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Furthermore, although old age is identified as posing the greatest risk for disease development, it appears that other factors, such as genetic mutations, oxidative stress, diet, and certain medical conditions, may also play a role (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5,6)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The purpose of this literature review is to examine how oxidative stress, particularly due to deficiencies in vitamins D and E and diabetes mellitus (DM), may lead to the development of AD, and to evaluate the implications that these findings may have on further research. This paper will first address these risk factors for the disease, and will then discuss how knowledge about them can potentially lead to targets for treatment. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Oxidative Stress as a Cause of Ad</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although old age is known to be the most common cause of AD, it appears that other factors may also be responsible for the cognitive decline that leads to the development of the disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as one of these factors, as the accumulation of free radical species induces damage in vital macromolecules, such as DNA, proteins, and lipids (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,7)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Though the mechanism is not fully understood, this seems to induce inflammatory reactions from the brain, leading to damage and the formation of beta-amyloid plaques (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">8)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. While oxidative stress has a multitude of causes, there are three in particular that may be positively correlated with the risk for AD: vitamin D deficiency, vitamin E deficiency, and diabetes mellitus.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vitamin D Deficiency</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vitamin D has been shown to have a protective effect against cognitive decline in the brain, as it appears to prevent neurodegeneration due to its antioxidant effects</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Thus, it is not surprising that individuals who are deficient in vitamin D have been found to have an increased risk of developing AD (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5,6)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This link was shown to hold true in a study of 1,658 U.S. adults who initially did not have any form of dementia</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The researchers followed up with the study participants after an average of 5.6 years and found that 102 of them had developed AD, and that there was a positive correlation with vitamin D deficiency (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Another study conducted in Italy showed the same results: vitamin D deficiency was responsible for a larger number of participants developing AD after a 6 year follow up (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similarly, a different study found AD risk to be greater in northern regions compared to southern in Italy, New Zealand, and Chile (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">9)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. While this trend initially did not seem to relate to vitamin D deficiency, it was noted that people in the northern regions were more likely to be deficient in the vitamin, thus further demonstrating its role in AD development (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">9)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While these studies provide evidence that individuals lacking in vitamin D have an increased risk of AD, there may be other influences present that could be affecting the risk. Additionally, most studies only examine elderly individuals with this particular deficiency, so it is unknown if insufficient amounts of the vitamin throughout life is the issue, or whether a short-term deficiency later in life is enough to increase the risk (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6,9)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. However, the correlation between AD and vitamin D does seem to support that oxidative stress may cause the disease (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5,6,9)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vitamin E Deficiency</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like vitamin D, a lack of vitamin E also seems to pose a greater risk for development of AD (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3,10-12)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Vitamin E refers to eight different compounds, four tocopherols and four tocotrienols, all of which appear to promote antioxidation in the body (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">16)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Deficiencies in the tocopherols, especially alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, may have a link to AD. Lack of alpha-tocopherol seems to result in nerve cell damage and death, as this deficiency has been found to cause less branching of the dendrites in Purkinje fibers, significantly decreasing communication throughout the brain (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3,10,12)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Additionally, deficiencies of both alpha- and gamma-tocopherol may lead to neuroinflammation due to oxidative stress, further enhancing cognitive decline and, consequently, AD (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3,8,10,12)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In contrast, other research has shown vitamin E levels alone to have no impact on AD risk (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,13)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Some studies have reported that there is no significant difference in serum vitamin E levels in patients with and without AD, while others have reported that the difference only occurs in individuals that genetically have a higher risk for AD (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">13)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. A few studies have found a correlation between vitamin E deficiency and the ApoE4 gene variant, but research in this area is limited, as many people do not know that they have this mutation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Thus, due to the conflicting evidence on the relationship between vitamin E and AD, more studies are necessary.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hyperglycemia experienced in patients with DM may cause oxidative stress due to the accumulation of superoxides (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4,14)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This oxidative stress can then manifest in the brain, leading to damage and death of neurons. Therefore, it follows that patients with DM may have an increased risk of developing AD, as demonstrated in various studies (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4,15)\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In some cases, it appears that the risk for AD doubles in patients with DM (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The relationship between AD and DM was further explored in terms of cardiovascular disease. It has been hypothesized that cardiovascular disease increases the risk for AD, but upon further analysis, it appeared that this correlation may be due to the factors that pose risks for cardiovascular disease, such as DM. However, a study testing this hypothesis did not find a significant relationship between AD and DM (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">15)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. While it did seem that DM may increase the risk for dementia, there was no increase of plaques or tangles in the brains of diabetic patients, and thus no indication of an increased risk for AD. Consequently, more research in this area is necessary due to the opposing findings.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Potential Treatments</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since oxidative stress has been identified as a potential cause for AD, treatment options targeting this are currently under investigation. Both vitamin and herbal supplements may be able to prevent or lessen the effects of AD due to their antioxidative effects, and thus are being examined for their efficacy (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7,11,16,17)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dietary Antioxidants</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vitamins with antioxidant effects, such as vitamin E, have shown success in reducing cognitive decline in some individuals (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">16)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Consuming increased amounts of vitamin E, both through supplements and food sources, may lead to a decreased risk for development of dementia (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">11,16)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In a specific analysis of the components of vitamin E, it appears that the increased presence of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol reduces the progression of mild cognitive impairment to AD, although it is dependent on the dose, which varies based on the person.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, there is contrasting evidence that vitamin E may not make a difference at all, or that it may actually be harmful (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,16)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In a study conducted on 769 individuals, there were no significant differences between the placebo group and the vitamin E supplement group in terms of their development of AD (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">16)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Furthermore, one study found that vitamin E doses above 800 IU/d have been shown to cause death</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. However, since other studies cited that doses of 1000 IU/d prevented cognitive decline, more research is necessary in order to fully evaluate the effects of the vitamin.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Herbal Supplements</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, some herbal supplements may also play a role in reducing cognitive decline, as they contain flavonoids that can function as antioxidants (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7,17)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Pomegranate peel extract as a treatment has been successful in reducing the amount of plaque formation without causing harm to the liver, which is a concern in some herbal supplements (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">17)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Similarly, green tea pills seemed to have a beneficial effect on people with AD, as they reduced oxidative damage in many areas of the body, including nervous tissue (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. While both of these supplements appear to reduce oxidative damage, more clinical trials are necessary, as there currently is not enough evidence to determine their efficacy.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The damage of nerve cells and accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques attributed to oxidative stress has caused clinicians and researchers to investigate the link between oxidative stress and AD (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,7,8)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. While vitamin D deficiency appears to be linked to AD due to the general neuroprotective effects that the vitamin has, vitamin E deficiency seems to be linked to Purkinje fiber damage and neuronal death (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,3,6,9.10,11,16)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Furthermore, the hyperglycemia faced by many individuals with DM may cause accumulation of superoxides in the brain, ultimately leading to damage and death of neurons (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4,14)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In all three of these conditions, the oxidative stress experienced by the individuals appears to be positively correlated with an increased risk for AD (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3-6,9-11,14)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. However, there are studies that present results that disagree with these trends, highlighting the complexity of this condition and its potential causes (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,13,15)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Consideration of oxidative stress as a cause of AD has led to treatment options specifically targeting these areas. Vitamin E supplements have been given to patients due to their antioxidant effects, and while some trials have reported positive results, others have reported no benefit, or even negative results (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,11,13)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In addition, some herbal supplements, such as green tea extract and pomegranate peels, have been shown to reduce oxidative damage and thus delay the effects and reduce the damage of AD (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7,17)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. However, more clinical trials are necessary in order to fully evaluate the benefits of supplements, as there is a limited amount of evidence available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overall, the advancements in research of AD leading to the discovery of oxidative damage as a potential cause for the disease have uncovered many possible treatment options. Further research in this area is necessary to identify a potential cure for a disease that affects so many people.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lillenes MS, Rabano A, St\u00f8en M, et al.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe controversial topic of a human head transplant caught me by surprise when I read about it in the news. I was curious about the psychological, immunological, and technical complications of this procedure. After researching it, I became more knowledgeable and open-minded towards it.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1202\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2013, physician Dr. Sergio Canavero proposed to attempt the world\u2019s first human head transplant as a last treatment option for patients with diseases that infect their body, but leave their brains healthy. The volunteer is Valery Spiridinov, a 31-year old man suffering from Werdnig-Hoffman disease, a disorder characterized by muscle atrophy. An outline of the procedure was published in the International Journal of Surgery.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Canavero\u2019s paper first describes the procedure of a head-body transplant performed by Dr. Robert White in a Rhesus monkey in the 1970\u2019s. The monkey appeared normal after the transplant in all measures, but survived for only 8 days due to the lack of technology to re-connect the spinal cord. Now, nearly five decades later, Canavero\u2019s protocol includes more advanced technology. First, an especially sharp blade is used to sever the recipient\u2019s head from his body. A brain-dead donor\u2019s body, whose immunotype is matched to the recipient, is selected. After the recipient\u2019s head is drained of blood, it, along with the spinal cord of the donor\u2019s body, is chilled to temperatures of 12-15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u03bf</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">C. Studies have shown the ability to restore functions of the brain with arrested circulatory blood flow without neurological damage within 45 minutes. The rest of the recipient\u2019s body, however, is kept at normal temperature to maintain organ functions. Appropriate monitoring of the organs, as well as injection of anesthesia and antibiotics, is applied. Spinal cord, vessels, and veins of head and body are subsequently sewn together within 1-2 minutes. A solution that facilitates in membrane fusion and acts as a neuroprotectant is applied through an IV into the bloodstream. Immunosuppressant drugs, identical to those taken by organ transplant patients, are used. The patient is provided with psychological therapy during recovery.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Two reviews by Furr and colleagues published in 2017 provided additional methods for the most difficult part of the surgery: re-connection of the spinal cord. The methods were successful in patients who suffer from spinal injuries. Additionally, it emphasized the maintenance of an intact blood-brain barrier as critical in preventing access of immunoregulatory cells to the brain, which lowers the chances of the body rejecting the brain. They also proposed manipulating the donor body\u2019s bone marrow cell precursors of immune cells to recognize antigens of the face and head. The psychological risks the patient would encounter are currently unknown because a self-body dissonance as large as the one that the patient will experience has never been encountered. Although, enhancement of life quality reported by patients who underwent face transplants indicated a possible positive outcome. More research on the brain immunology axis was suggested. Additionally, opponents in the bioethics department pointed to the inability to provide Mr. Spiridinov with the full risks of the procedure, to ensure informed consent, as a large red flag.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A successful head transplant has enormous implications on the possibilities provided by science and technology in the future. Currently, 800 physicians and health-care professionals have joined Dr. Canavero\u2019s team. The surgery is scheduled to take place in December 2017.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Canavero, S. (2013).

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI became interested in vector-borne diseases in Spring of 2016, when I conducted an independent study on the ethical advancement of genetically modifying technology. I discussed the potential application of CRISPR to mosquitoes, primarily </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aedes aegypti</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, in the effort to combat dengue. Throughout my extensive research, the danger posed by mosquitoes was commonly emphasized by diverse sources. It was thus surprising to read that Microsoft\u2019s Project Premonition is based on the assertion that mosquitoes can be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">useful </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to us in our quest to control vector-borne diseases. My intrigue led me to research the project further to better understand its method, application, and potential.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1210\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vector-borne epidemics have become increasingly common across the globe, causing over 1 million deaths and affecting over 1 billion people annually [8]. As such, efforts to mitigate their spread have gained momentum. Due to the fact that numerous emerging vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and zika are transmitted primarily by mosquitoes, many disease-control strategies have focused on minimizing mosquito populations [8]. Among the diverse strategies that have been tested and employed on mosquitoes are genetically modifying them with gene-editing techniques such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) or release of insects with dominant lethality (RIDL), altering their habitats and resources by introducing competitor or predatory species, and using insecticides. Each of these methods have been met with varying degrees of success and concern for the safety of their use [3,5,6]. One particular team has undertaken a different approach \u2013 rather than attempting to combat mosquito populations, Microsoft\u2019s Project Premonition seeks to learn from the valuable information they can provide us. It does so with the vision that future vector-borne outbreaks may not only be controlled, but avoided altogether [7]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is unusual to suggest that mosquitoes, being the primary vectors of harmful infectious diseases, may be used to prevent such diseases. Since its inception in 2015, Project Premonition, led by Microsoft researcher Ethan Jackson, has worked to create a system that uses data collected from mosquitoes to detect pathogens before they cause widespread outbreaks. This has been difficult to do thus far, mainly because of the difficulty in collecting reliable data using current traditional techniques. Project Premonition aims to override this obstacle by effectively finding \u201cmosquito hotspots\u201d with drones rather than satellites, collecting mosquitoes with robotic traps that are equipped to lure and identify specimens, and detecting both known and unknown pathogens with a metagenomics approach that involves gene sequencing the collected mosquito DNA with a SNAP alignment tool, a recent development made collaboratively by Microsoft, UC Berkeley, and UCSF [1,2,4,7]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The project aims to acquire data on mosquito genetics and behavior across various species, as well as environmental data pertaining to natural factors such as time, wind, temperature, and light levels. The data will be analyzed collectively to visualize patterns in mosquitoes and the spread of vector-borne diseases, which will then be used to predict oncoming epidemics. In doing so, the project can enable disease-mitigation strategies to work more efficiently, simply by alerting them to certain diseases that are gaining prevalence. The project may also enable diseases to be prevented completely [4,7].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While Project Premonition is not a solution to the vector-borne epidemics currently affecting world populations, it offers itself as a potentially valuable method for disease prevention in the near future. The collaborative effort between Microsoft and various academic and research institutions, such as Johns Hopkins University, UCSF, UC Riverside, and UC Berkeley, highlights the project\u2019s multidimensional and innovative approach, which may help ensure its practicality in terms of cost, safety, and efficacy. Despite its atypical attitude toward disease-spreading mosquitoes, Project Premonition\u2019s ability to recognize the usefulness of mosquitoes as well as their imposing threat is precisely what makes its endeavor promising [4,7]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Boyle, Alan. \u201cHow Microsoft\u2019s Project Premonition uses robotic traps to zero in on Zika mosquitoes.\u201d 16 February 2017.

        "title": "Got a Spare?",
        "author": "Harrison Manacsa, Biological Sciences, \u201817",
        "date": "06/10/2017",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThis started as a case study I wrote on my friend\u2019s chronic kidney disease for UWP104F. She was diagnosed during our freshman year; and I see the impact of her weekly dialysis on her family, diet, and college schedule. Knowing that a kidney transplant will greatly improve her health, I researched the processes one would undertake to donate their kidney. As it turns out, there are numerous factors one should consider. My article briefs on the current state of kidney donation. It is an expression of my amazement of turning our bodies into tools.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1218\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We have two hands. We have two eyes and two ears. We have a pair of lungs and a pair of feet. Often, we overlook why some of our body parts come in pairs. Even more so if we\u2019re left with one. If I were to lose one or both, could you share yours? Are our bodies purposefully designed with spare parts?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sitting just below our stomach, sandwiching the left and right ends of our small intestine, are two fist-sized, bean-shaped organs that drain to one bladder. The kidneys are the filters of our body and the gateway to the urinary system. As harmful salts and metabolites in our blood sift through the filtering nephrons, they are pumped into the bladder and become urine. One kidney can accomplish this task. But two kidneys double the body\u2019s filtering power, which underpins the congruency of all harmonious body pairings. However, when both kidneys are dysfunctional, blood filtration halts. Bile and ions recirculate in the blood and poison the organs from which they came. Urination ceases, and body-wide organ failure ensues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the modularity of the human body becomes more apparent to us, we realize that sharing our kidneys is just one of the many humanly attributable acts that we can do for one another. Since the early 1900\u2019s, scientists have been fascinated with giving the organs of brain-dead, effectively deceased people to living patients. In 1954, Dr. Joseph Murray and Dr. David Hume perfected the first living donor kidney transplant between identical twin brothers. Eight years later, the medical pair performed the first deceased donor transplant in a procedure that demonstrated patient-donor kidney compatibility (Barker </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). The two types of kidney donors offer their advantages and shortcomings. While deceased donors may give up both of their kidneys, living donors can only give one. However, living donors often present stronger, cleaner, and healthier kidneys that are less likely to fail in a recipient\u2019s lifetime (\u201cLiving Kidney Donor Network\u201d). Today, many patients in the United States receive new kidneys from deceased donors; however, these donations are currently managed by an overwhelmed and impacted system (Organ Donation and Transplantation Statistics).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), which established the guidelines for the nationwide allocation of organs to transplant patients. Part of NOTA\u2019s Title II proposal is the establishment of the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) (Public Interest Law). Today, UNOS maintains the central database of eligible patients waiting for a cadaver\u2019s kidney. But due to the increased demand for kidneys, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">UNOS has been stigmatized in pop culture as the ominous \u201cwaiting list.\u201d Patients suffer interminable waiting times and dwindling patience. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2014, the National Kidney Foundation estimated that of the 100,000 patients that waited in line through UNOS, only 11,570 underwent a transplant. On average, 3,000 new patients were added every month, while the median waiting time for a patient steadily increased to 3.6 years (Organ Donation and Transplantation Statistics). During this time, a patient\u2019s immune system and vasculature will have deteriorated until he or she has become too weak to even undergo a transplant. For this reason, UNOS encourages healthy individuals to consider becoming living kidney donors. UNOS\u2019 homepage greets visitors with an advertisement recruiting living-kidney donations and lists the basic criteria needed by eligible donors (Home | UNOS).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ideal kidney donors must be at least 18 years of age and free of any health conditions that are difficult to treat, such as AIDS or cancer (Living Donation). Additional requirements vary by a donor\u2019s specific body criteria</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">gender, body weight, usual diet</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and the state where the surgery will take place. Once evaluated, a donor is matched to a kidney recipient with similar blood and immunological antibodies (Living Donation). Surprisingly, the strict need for perfect donor-recipient pairings has decreased in recent years. With the troubling health statistics of transplant patients, Dr. Karl Womer of Johns Hopkins Medicine believes that \u201cit is really important to have a transplant as soon as possible and with any degree of matching. It\u2019s better to have a transplant than not\u201d (\u201cWhat Kidney Donors Need to Know\u201d). Donors typically undergo a laparoscopic nephrectomy. Once they are anesthetized, three small incisions are made at-and-around their belly button, where a camera and a hot cauterizing iron are inserted. Surgeons carefully burn all connections to the kidney, and then simply reach in with their hand to grab it. Larger donors may need to have a wider incision for better identification and acquisition of their kidney. After the two-hour surgery, donors recover in the hospital for an additional four to six days (Gupta </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cLiving donors recover quickly,\u201d says Dr. Edward Gibney, a nephrologist at Piedmont Atlanta Hospital in Georgia (What It\u2019s Like to Be a Living Kidney Donor). \u201c[Donors] should be able to get back to work and [their] life in just a few weeks.\u201d During this time, the size and filtration rate of the donor\u2019s sole kidney will increase to compensate for the loss of the other kidney. And because the donor and recipient will leave with only one kidney each, both patients will forever need to minimize all dangers that can physically damage their kidney, including lower-back injuries, excessive sodium and alcohol consumption, or misuse of prescribed medication. Although considered very unlikely, complications such as hypertension may arise in both the donor and the recipient but are manageable through healthy diets and moderate exercise. According to the National Kidney Foundation, more than 80% of donors are satisfied with their decision (What to Expect After Donation).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yet if living donors more effectively rescue transplant-awaiting patients, why are volunteers still limited? Sally Satel, in her </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New York Times</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> article \u201cWhy People Don\u2019t Donate Their Kidneys,\u201d conveys that people only donate their organs in an \u201caltruistic\u201d context. For instance, families and friends of transplant patients are more willing to donate because of their adherent values of emotional or genetic bonds (Satel). When 47-year-old Karen Shatka was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease\u2014a genetic disorder that caused a fluid-filled cyst to destroy her kidneys (Polycystic Kidney Disease)\u2014eleven of her family members volunteered to donate (Kidney Living Donor Transplant A Case Study).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ellen, Karen\u2019s stepsister, was the closest match, and the two underwent surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, in 2012. Ellen says that she is \u201cso blessed to be a living donor for Karen. [She\u2019d] do anything for her\u201d (Kidney Living Donor Transplant A Case Study). But many other diseased kidney patients are not so fortunate. In 2014, 20-year-old Tamara Nguyen was diagnosed with end-stage chronic kidney disease, which meant that numerous factors, such as diet and predisposed hypertension, prompted her kidneys to deteriorate. However, upon learning of her condition, Tamara\u2019s parents and siblings all refused to donate. Tamara believes that, as a Vietnamese woman, her family\u2019s cultural stigmas place her health at a low priority. Instead, Tamara depends on dialysis to filter her blood for two hours, twice a week. She believes that she is better off seeking help from a stranger. In 2016, Nguyen is still on the \u201cwaiting list.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When it comes to donating to a stranger, though, Satel laments that some institutions \u201cforbid donors [from receiving] anything of tangible value in return for their lifesaving deeds.\u201d Due to potential complications with the donor\u2019s and recipient\u2019s health, some institutions won\u2019t fund transplant operations and recovery costs. Additionally, it is illegal to sell or purchase organs. NOTA\u2019s \u201cTitle III,\u201d the \u201cProhibition of Organ Purchases,\u201d states that \u201cit shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly\u2026 transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce\u201d (Public Interest Law). This is all to say that donors may find difficulty in being rewarded for their generous gift. In fact, donors are largely ignored after their transplant surgery. According to the Living Donation California website, transplant expenses for a kidney donor are covered by the donor\u2019s health insurance; however, subsequent follow-up and check-up services are not, and neither are lost wages from time off work (Who Pays for Living Donation and Kidney Transplants). Essentially, neither the health care providers nor the government will compensate kidney donors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All limitations considered, perhaps institutions and regulations also bolster the need for donors. If donors are paid for the value of their kidney, then transplantable kidneys will become a purchasable commodity, and a free market for organs will favor patients who can afford them and exclude patients who cannot. Through donors, all patients have an equal opportunity for regaining a normal life. Supporters of such philanthropic approaches include Dr. Paul Dooley and Dr. Jeremiah Lowney. In 2004, the medical pair co-founded the website MatchingDonors.com, where potential organ donors can make an online profile and match with a registered transplant patient. Dr. Dooley was motivated to start MatchingDonors after his father was denied placement onto the UNOS transplant list because, as Dr. Dooley\u2019s website conveys, \u201cthe list was so long that by the time a kidney would become available Mr. Dooley\u2019s father would not still be alive\u201d (Organ Donor, Organ Transplant, Organ Donor Services). It is unsuccessful stories such as Dr. Dolley\u2019s that prompted Jacob Halupka, a 38-year-old father of three, to donate to a stranger. In a 2007 interview with People Magazine, Halupka described making his profile on MatchingDonors as \u201ca calling. It\u2019s difficult to read these stories and not want to help\u201d (Kidneys Online). In fact, more and more people like Jacob Halupka are searching for patients-in-need online. In 2011, East Haven, Connecticut mayor Aprile Capone Almon donated one of her kidneys to Carlos Sanchez, a transplant patient she found on Facebook. Mayor Almon responded to Sanchez\u2019s Facebook post with the \u00a0message, \u201cCarlos, I\u2019ll get tested, I\u2019ve got two, so what the hell? You can have one\u201d (Facebook Helps Facilitate Organ Donation). Today, MatchingDonors has over 14,000 registered potential donors. Many of the website\u2019s pairings continue to be publicized by CNN, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Huffington Post</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and television shows like \u201cHot in Cleveland\u201d (Organ Donor, Organ Transplant, Organ Donor Services). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Clearly, the public is starting to become aware of something marvelous. We know that pairings are a natural component of nature, but as we have learned from the symmetry that underlies our anatomy, we increasingly realize that humans are capable of helping one another on an astonishing level. The decision to donate a kidney comes with an enormous responsibility for both the donor and the recipient. Donors should take into consideration the long-term benefits and risks to their health and wellness. Yet it is amazing that such a decision can even be contemplated by any such organism. Perhaps our organ-sharing abilities are what truly separate humans from other creatures in nature. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Works Cited</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Barker, C.

After reading that congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect, I was compelled to do some research on how tissue engineering has sought to improve existing surgical options. After coming across a couple articles about acellular valve conduits, I decided to report on the research of the University of Minnesota, which was recently published in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nature Communications</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1222\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Congenital heart defects are a serious and increasingly prevalent problem, with treatment limited to synthetic valve and vessel replacements. The inability of these replacements to grow and respond to their biological environment calls for repeated open-heart surgeries to resize the prosthetics, especially in children. Scientists, led by the University of Minnesota, have recently developed artificial blood vessels that can grow inside the patient. This advancement could potentially eliminate the need for multiple heart surgeries in children with congenital heart defects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cardiac defects, such as pulmonary atresia, sometimes require surgery to create a connection between the arteries and left ventricle. Homografts, tailored pulmonary arteries taken from a person who has died, and bovine jugular vein grafts obtained from cows, are the only two materials currently available to form this connection. However, these materials don\u2019t grow with the child, which means that the graft will eventually be too small. The graft will have to be replaced with a larger one at some point as the child \u201coutgrows\u201d the conduit. \u00a0Other complications, such as shrinkage of the conduit due to calcification, add to the probability that the child will have to undergo five to seven procedures during their lifetime. A conduit with the ability to grow would greatly benefit children with heart defects. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although there are methods being developed that use autologous cell grafts and polymers, researchers at the University of Minnesota have developed an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">acellular</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> graft with growth potential that does not require cells to be isolated from the patient and cultured before implantation. Instead, the patient\u2019s own cells would be able to colonize and grow on the acellular graft post-implantation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThis might be the first time we have an \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 material that doctors can implant in a patient, and it can grow in the body,\u201d said Robert Tranquillo, who led the research team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The researchers seeded sheep dermal fibroblast cells into fibrin gel, a biodegradable protein scaffold. The cells secreted extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, which are essential for the regular gene expression, migration, proliferation and differentiation of cells. To form the material into vessel-like structures, the cell-populated gel was wrapped into tiny tubes. Then, the material was put in a bioreactor with the necessary nutrients, which also strengthened and stiffened the cells by keeping them in constant motion. The synthetic blood vessels were finally washed with special detergents to remove all the sheep cells, leaving behind a cell-free protein matrix. Because all cells are efficiently removed, there is no risk of rejection and no need for immunosuppression. The resulting tube, composed of mostly collagen, can be stored until needed for an operation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To test the manufactured blood vessels, the synthetic vessels replaced part of the pulmonary artery in three lambs at five weeks of age. Ultrasound images taken over 50 weeks to monitor the artificial vessels showed that the implanted vessels were successfully populated by the lambs\u2019 own cells, allowing the vessel to grow together with the recipient into adulthood. In fact, the collagen protein increased 465 percent by week 50, confirming that the vessel had not simply expanded but had really grown. \u201cThis is the perfect marriage between tissue engineering and regenerative medicine where tissue is grown in the lab and then, after implanting the decellularized tissue, the natural processes of the recipient\u2019s body makes it a living tissue again,\u201d Tranquillo said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although Tranquillo\u2019s animal studies are promising, further studies and endeavors are necessary to determine if these artificial vessels can be used in humans. This exciting breakthrough highlights the possibility that vessels grown in labs can grow with the recipient. The benefits of this research are far-reaching, with the potential to eliminate the need for multiple surgeries in children and greatly relieve the health care system of high costs due to the need for periodic replacement of grafts. Most importantly, acellular conduits have the likely power to significantly improve the quality of life of children with congenital heart disease. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sources</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blaszczak-Boxe, Agata. \u201cArtificial Blood Vessels Grow After They\u2019re Implanted.\u201d Live Science.

This is a subset of health care that is in my opinion talked about too much but not enough \u2013 especially when it comes to abortion. I initially wrote this piece for an upper division writing class focusing on women\u2019s health; but reproductive health care access soon transformed into a cause that is now a great passion of mine. The results from the literature had me fiercely enraged yet profoundly inspired. Women all over the world today are denied necessary health care because of skewed perceptions of family planning and women as a whole. Abortion services \u2013 be it via medication or surgical procedure \u2013 are vital to communities, not just women. What troubled me most was discovering that the women who are already struggling suffer the greatest from abortion restrictions \u2013 women who already have mouths to feed, who are working multiple jobs just to make ends meet, who are uninsured, and often have no support system at all. It saddens me to know that the needs of these women are so often disregarded as communities make judgements, and as lawmakers work to regulate women\u2019s reproductive rights. Deciding to have an abortion can take a huge psychological and physical toll on women and their families; and abortion restrictions only make this experience more trying for them. This, however will not prevent women from seeking abortions, it will only cause more of them to suffer major health complications or even die trying to obtain an abortion. This piece is for anyone out there like me: someone who wants to get educated, who wants to join the conversation, and who wants to become a stronger advocate for women\u2019s reproductive rights!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1226\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Abstract</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This review of literature aims to assess the overall status of reproductive health care access nationwide. It investigates how statewide perceptions, stigmas, and policies affect access to this kind of health care, with an emphasis on abortion services. It was found that conservative states were positively correlated with having stricter reproductive health care restrictions. Three components: state legislation, perceptions, and stigmas have been shown to influence each other and shape regional access to reproductive health care. This paper investigates the unique experiences and struggles women face when seeking these services and are met with access restrictions. Women experienced significant economic and psychological stress as the level of abortion restrictions increased, which also affected their family planning decisions including if, when, and where they want to obtain contraceptives, prenatal care, or an abortion. Physicians also played a role in providing access to these services and influencing women\u2019s health care decisions. With this knowledge, policy makers, physicians, and communities can better understand the world of reproductive health care and become better advocates for the improvement of access to these services on a national and even global scale. Additionally, this insight has the potential to influence the progression of women\u2019s reproductive rights, which will in turn improve the health and well-being of women, their families, and communities alike.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Keywords</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> abortion, reproductive health care access, family planning, United States, policies, perceptions, abortion stigma, abortion restrictions, physician\u2019s role, social conservatism, reproductive health care knowledge, health care decisions, experiences</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Introduction</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Abortion access in the United States is a heavily debated issue and has kept the country politically and socially divided for decades. The question of how accessible abortion services are to women remains varied across state lines. Statewide perception, knowledge, and opinion regarding abortion have a great ability to affect statewide policies, how women access family planning services, and how they make their health care decisions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,3,10-12,15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Restrictions such as gestational age limits, longer waiting periods, and an increased number of visits to abortion facilities have been shown to cause a major strain in the lives of women.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Women are forced to sacrifice more time, energy, and money to undergo this process, with low-income women bearing the hardest burden.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6,8</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The Guttmacher Institute, a leader in sexual and reproductive health research, reported an implementation of 334 abortion restrictions between 2011 and 2016 nationwide by states including Texas, Michigan, Missouri, and Alabama.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Seventeen of these states had also recently motioned to eliminate funding for abortions and family planning service providers like Planned Parenthood.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These motions could have serious implications for women if enacted across the country. Women seeking abortions and are living in many of these communities that are misinformed and disregarded by lawmakers and health care professionals will not only find themselves struggling to find an abortion-providing facility, but will suffer greater health risks due to the lack of well-trained professionals. This review of literature works to reveal and understand the statewide societal perceptions surrounding abortion and how they influence public policy and social views regarding reproductive health. The unique experiences and struggles women face as a result of these views and policies are investigated to better understand the effects abortion restrictions have on women. In the wake of current upheaval regarding reproductive health care access, it is vital that this topic be discussed to further protect women\u2019s rights. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Discussion</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Regional Influences on Family Planning  Perceptions, Stigma, and Policy</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Statewide perceptions and attitudes toward reproductive health care services such as abortion have been found to impact their level of accessibility to women. Factors including socioeconomic status and the amount of accurate abortion information provided to women show to have the largest effect.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4,5,8-13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Attitudes regarding abortion are not only present at the societal level, but also infiltrate state legislation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1,2,15 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Therefore, it is important that varying regional perceptions and stigmas be investigated to understand how they affect policy and women\u2019s accessibility to reproductive health care services. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perceptions and Stigma</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Current literature suggests that socially conservative states tend to have negative views on unplanned pregnancy, non-abstaining forms of birth control, and abortion.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3,9,13,15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These states have also been found to provide less accurate abortion information to women than socially liberal states.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These attitudes and lack of education regarding family planning can play a major role in the way women make important family planning decisions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">10,11,13,14</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Studies looking at the relationship between social ideologies and knowledge and perceptions of family planning have revealed some insightful results. Daniels et al. compared statewide accuracy of embryonic and fetal development information provided to women seeking abortions. They revealed that one-third of the information deemed inaccurate by specialists were congregated in Southern and Midwestern states \u2013 otherwise, typical conservative states.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These results could explain findings from a 2016 study which assessed Texan women\u2019s knowledge and support of abortion restrictions. A large proportion of women believed that abortion was morally wrong and were in support of restricted access.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Women with these views were more likely to be from socially conservative groups (conservative Republican or Catholic) compared to their more liberal Democrat or Protestant counterparts.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> However, over half the participants were either completely unaware or had little knowledge of current legislation on this topic.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> According to Smith et al., social attitudes and widespread inaccurate reproductive health knowledge appears to have a major impact on the women seeking abortion services in other conservative states.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> A study conducted in Alabama revealed that although most women know there is a high abortion rate in the state, women who obtain abortions are highly judged by their communities, causing it to be a hushed or hidden occurrence.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Smith\u2019s study is just one example of how negative perceptions regarding unplanned pregnancy and abortion can reinforce socially conservative views that are already unsupportive of reproductive health services. This cycle thus appears to be more prolific in socially conservative states, where more inaccurate reproductive health information is provided to communities, as observed in states like Alabama and Texas. These factors therefore play a major role in the public\u2019s attitude regarding this issue, which can reflect voting patterns, policies, and the ways in which women make their health care choices. On the other hand, a study done by Aiken and Scott did not find a strong correlation between voting patterns of state legislators and stances on family planning.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> More research should be conducted to explain the relationship between voting habits and statewide perceptions of abortion. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How Perceptions Influence Policy</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perceptions and stigma regarding abortion and unplanned pregnancy can impact both women\u2019s health care decisions, and state policies on abortion access.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,5,6,13,14</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although Bessett et al.\u2019s study comparing attitudes and related state policies between conservative Republican \u201cred states\u201d and liberal Democrat \u201cblue states\u201d did not find a strong correlation between the two, the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s most recent census on American reproductive health care access and related laws reported that 17 states, predominantly from the South and Midwest, passed 46 new abortion restrictions in 2016.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3,12</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These restrictions required abortion providers to obtain unnecessary hospital admitting privileges, withhold funding to abortion-providing facilities, deny women insurance coverage, and enforce gestational age limits.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Counter regulations, however, have also been implemented to help increase access such as broadening women\u2019s eligibility for insurance coverage, as well as supreme court overturns of major abortion restrictions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Therefore, although many states are working to further restrict abortion access, many others are working to increase accessibility and improve family planning for their female residents.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">12</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>The Effects of Abortion Restrictions on Women</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Public knowledge and perception regarding abortion and family planning not only influence local policy, but also the experiences \u00a0and reproductive health care decisions of women seeking these services.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Kimball and Wissner\u2019s assessment of state-level social determinants of health found that religiosity, social conservatism, and voting preferences were positively correlated with teen birth, abortion, and infant mortality rates, with the highest correlation being with social conservatism.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">9</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Secondary factors such as gestational age limits, financial cost, and harassment found by Jerman and Jones, which are more common in socially conservative states, cause psychological and economic stress for women seeking abortions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Between 2011 and 2012, women paid an average of $480 for abortion procedures, and found it more difficult to access facilities that would perform abortions as the gestational age increased. These same women also faced picketing and entry blockage at 84% of the abortion clinics visited nationwide. With these issues being more common in socially conservative areas, this could explain why Midwestern and Southern conservative states have the highest abortion rates but the fewest abortion-providing facilities.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6,7,13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> As a result, women seeking abortion procedures in these states are forced to travel much further, as well as struggle to find childcare, take time off work, face judgement, and even reduce food budgets for their families.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,6,8,11,13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This may elucidate why many women either hesitate to have or completely forgo abortion procedures.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These examples are typical situations for most women seeking abortions in conservative regions of the United States, with low-income women suffering the greatest strain.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Thus, these social and economic restrictions prove to not only affect women\u2019s well-being, but also the well-being of their families.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,8,9,11,13</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conservative states (particularly Midwestern and Southern ones) are characterized as having several layers of abortion restrictions, which in turn negatively influence abortion rates and the well-being of women and their families living in these areas.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,6,8,9,11,13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> If restrictions continue to prove effective at limiting access to accurate information, specialized physicians, abortion facilities, and related affordable reproductive health care services, women will continue to either forgo the care they need or find much riskier solutions, which could result in major health complications.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>The Physician\u2019s Role in Family Planning</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A physician\u2019s role in the family planning process is vital to women\u2019s health and the future of their families. Although it is the duty of a physician to provide care regardless of personal beliefs or attitudes, many physicians either refuse to perform abortions even when qualified to do so, or fail to support the needs of their patients when discussing family planning options.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">10</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Therefore, assessing physicians\u2019 abilities to provide accurate health care information and patient advocacy is an essential component to understanding abortion access nationwide. Although, physicians self-reported being able to overcome their personal opinions regarding abortions in a 2016 national study, female patients were seen as more worthy of empathy and abortion access by their physicians if they acted more feminine and expressed emotional remorse.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">10</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> In addition, physicians were more likely to delegitimize women\u2019s needs for abortion and limit access if their patients elected to undergo the procedure rather than if they required one for a fetal anomaly, maternal health risk, or incest.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">10</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Margo et al.\u2019s study of South Carolina revealed that many public health providers caring for women seeking abortion services imposed anti-abortion judgements on them, making many of these women doubt their original health care decisions and experience more self-judgement.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These studies reveal how influential the support and advice of physicians are to women making important family planning decisions. Physicians are seen as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to essential reproductive health services for women; therefore, supporting their female patients\u2019 wants and needs for these services is of crucial importance to improving women\u2019s health and well-being.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7,10,11,14</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many factors that influence women\u2019s reproductive health care decisions. Statewide perceptions, stigmas, knowledge, and implementation of access policies can determine if a woman receives proper care. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2-15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Conservative states in the South and Midwest present the greatest reproductive health care access limitations in the country, and thus, reflect the largest proportion of poor health outcomes for these women.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2-4,6-8,11-13,15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This review, however is not able to fully reflect nationwide abortion access. With the literature showing a greater focus on conservative statewide family planning access, the experiences of women who seek these services in liberal states remains underlooked and cannot be objectively compared to women\u2019s experiences in conservative states. The studies reviewed which assessed liberal state reproductive health care access showed to have major biases and lacked diverse samples of women.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This is unfortunately a common limitation in abortion access studies, where only women who successfully underwent abortions are sampled.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2,5,6,11,13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> With abortion access in liberal states typically being less restrictive compared to that of conservative states, it could explain why research in these areas is in short supply and might be more challenging to conduct. It is vital, however, that more data be collected in liberal states and from more diverse samples of women to adequately observe, assess, and improve reproductive health care access nationwide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The various regional factors reported in the recent literature that influence women\u2019s access to abortion services proved to be very insightful into the world of reproductive health care. These findings reveal several ways in which access to reproductive health care can be improved such as: (1) providing more accurate family planning information to communities, (2) making abortion-providing facilities more widely available, (3) supplementing these facilities with well-trained and empathetic physicians who perform affordable procedures, and (4) increasing insurance coverage for reproductive health care services overall. These are all excellent potential steps to not only improving reproductive health care, but the lives of women and their collective reproductive rights. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aiken ARA, Scott JG.

The purpose of this piece is to thoroughly inform the reader. In this article I will discuss how genetic variation affects nicotine dependence, review studies which examine the effects of this genetic variation, and discuss how genetic variation can influence the likelihood of other diseases. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This article aims to follow an individual\u2019s encounter with nicotine, starting with the first encounter of a cigarette to an examination of other diseases related to smoking. The sections below provide an explanation of the specific experiments which examined how nicotinic receptor genes \u00a0affect an individual\u2019s response to nicotine.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1372\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nicotine acts as an addictive neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the development of smoking and tobacco dependence. However, many individuals have different responses to smoking, and not all are susceptible to developing an addiction. Therefore, there must be other factors that influence the development of tobacco addiction.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Mechanism of Nicotine</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nicotine is a chemical that alters an individual\u2019s mood, behavior, cognition, and body functions. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels found in neurons. When activated, the nAChRs undergo a conformational change that allows ions to pass through the channels and transmit an action potential throughout the neurons. Researchers found that nicotine causes increased levels of dopamine when the nAChRs are located on dopaminergic neurons [1]. Thus, the release of dopamine contributes to nicotine\u2019s addictiveness.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Variation in Nicotinic Receptor Subunits</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An individual\u2019s physical response to nicotine depends on the types of subunits that make up the receptor. There are twelve genes that code for different subunits of nAChR, labeled </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u03b12\u2013\u03b110 and \u03b22\u2013\u03b24. \u00a0The nAChR is composed of five subunits arranged in a ring around a channel </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[1]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The most abundant high-affinity nAChRs in the human brain are composed of two \u03b14, two \u03b24, and a fifth subunit that is variable [2]. This suggests that addiction can have a genetic basis. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Dizziness Caused by the First Cigarette Predicts Genetic Predisposition To Nicotine Addiction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Every addiction begins with the first encounter with the drug, and nicotine addiction starting with smoking the first cigarette is no exception. Many first time tobacco smokers show a range of responses such as dizziness and nausea. Various phenotypic responses can be attributed to genetic variations in neuronal nicotinic receptor genes (CHRN). These genetic variations affect long term nicotine dependence. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genetic variation can influence an individual\u2019s initial response to a cigarette, which might \u00a0affect their perception and dependence on nicotine in the long term. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ehringer and his colleagues \u00a0discovered that the phenotypic response of dizziness was linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the CHRNB3 gene. Data from the experiments showed different levels of RNA expression resulting from SNPs in the CHRNB3 in smokers who reported dizziness after smoking their first cigarette. Notably, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">there was a strong correlation between dizziness and nicotine dependence. Individuals who had developed nicotine addiction reported a primarily negative physical response to the first cigarette [3]. Genetic variation is responsible for differences in physical responses to nicotine, which also affect the development of long term nicotine dependence. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The results of this study can be applied in clinical practice. Clinicians can use dizziness as an indication of an early smoking-related phenotype that is closely related to the underlying genetic mechanisms of tobacco addiction. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Youth and Nicotine Dependence</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nicotine dependence is also affected by the initial age of the smoker. Smokers who start at an earlier age are more likely to develop a lifelong nicotine addiction. Therefore, youths and adolescents have the greatest vulnerability for developing nicotine dependence. Specific genetic markers that are associated with a smoking phenotype, such as cigarettes smoked per day, can be a quantitative measure of nicotine dependence. In a longitudinal study led by Cannon, researchers identified the relationship between genetic variants and the smoking phenotype of cigarettes per day (CPD) in European smokers</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> between ages 15 and 21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. SNPs in several CHRN regions in young smokers (CHRNB3A6 SNP </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rs2304297</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CHRNA5A3B4 haplotype C, CHRNA2 SNP rs2271920) were found </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[4].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Each SNP independently contributed to an increase in cigarettes per day. These genetic markers are associated with increased smoking behavior in youth, supporting the claim that genetic variants can influence nicotine dependence.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Risk-taking Genes Might Explain Risk Taking Behavior in Youth</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Risky behavior varies among different populations due to genetic variation. Some individuals are more likely to start drinking or smoking because they have certain risk-taking alleles that contribute to their behavior. In a study of different ethnic populations, researchers found </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">significant differences in the allele frequency of SNP markers between Caucasians, Hispanics, and African Americans. Researchers found three SNPs in the CHRNA5, A3, and B4 (A5A3B4) gene cluster that are associated with an earlier age of initiation of both alcohol and tobacco consumption. Researchers concluded that variation in these genes might influence behaviors that promote early age experimentation with drugs and other risks. Considering how the A5A3B4 gene cluster influences nicotine dependence and alcohol consumption, it is very likely that these genes are involved in the development of risk-taking behavior. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Individuals with these alleles tend to experiment with harmful substances since they perceive nicotine and alcohol as a low risk [5]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genetic variation contributes to both behavior and risk perceptions. Consequently, genetics has a strong influence on nicotine dependence. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Genetic Variation in Nicotine Dependence</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Individuals have varied response to nicotine; some people become addicted after smoking just one cigarette, while others will never become addicted even after smoking one hundred cigarettes. To observe how genetic variation can affect smoking behavior, researchers must study a quantifiable phenotype that indicates nicotine dependence. Thus, in order to identify genes that influence nicotine dependencies, they must study a highly heritable and quantifiable phenotype such as the number of cigarettes per day (CPD). Individuals who have a higher CPD are at a greater risk of developing \u00a0long term nicotine dependence. In a genome wide study of three European populations, Berrettini et al examined if there were certain SNPs associated with an increase in CPD. The results found certain SNPs in the CHRNA5 within individuals who smoke more cigarettes per day [6]. Thus these SNPs were linked to an increase smoking behavior and higher risk of developing an addiction to nicotine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additional evidence suggests a strong genetic association with nicotine dependence. A recent study by Saccone found that a non-synonymous SNP in CHRNA5, in the genes of nicotine dependent individuals, increased the risk of nicotine dependence </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[7].</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A non-synonymous SNP is an SNP in a protein-coding region that results in a change in an amino acid, thus changing the overall protein structure. Researchers found the SNP caused an amino acid located at 398 to change from the normal allele containing asparagine to the risk allele with aspartic acid. This SNP had an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, meaning that individuals would have to inherit two mutated risk alleles in order to be nicotine dependent. Individuals who were homozygous for the risk allele experienced a two-fold increase in the risk of developing nicotine dependence [7]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This supports \u00a0the hypothesis that nicotine dependence has a genetic basis. Uncovering genetic factors that affect nicotine dependence will provide doctors with more knowledge to prevent, diagnose, and treat nicotine addiction. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genetic variation contributes to both increases and decreases in nicotine dependence. In a study by \u00a0Feng, researchers found an association between the CHRNA4 rs1044396 SNP and an increased nicotine dependence in Chinese males. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A genetic variant of CHRNA4 causes the C nucleotide to become a T nucleotide. The C allele increases the risk \u00a0of nicotine addiction while the T protects against nicotine addiction. The researchers found that </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">individuals with the C allele smoked more cigarettes and also had a greater dependence on nicotine. Interestingly, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CHRNA4 rs1044396 polymorphism is a synonymous polymorphism, insofar as \u00a0there is no change to the protein sequence [8]. This polymorphism must be further studied in order to understand its mechanisms with other CHRN genes. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Smoking Related Diseases</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to nicotine dependence, genetic variation can influence the likelihood of contracting other nicotine-related diseases. Thorgeirsson et al discovered a genetic association between an SNP in the CHRNA3 gene and an increase in smoking quantity, nicotine dependence, and the risk of smoking related diseases, such as lung cancer and peripheral arterial disease in patients of European descent. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They also found this genetic variant in 18% of lung cancer samples and 10% of peripheral arterial disease samples, which supports the conclusion that the SNP increased the chances of contracting both nicotine-related diseases [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genetic variation influences nicotine dependence and can increase one\u2019s susceptibility to developing smoking related diseases. Thus, smoking can have a variable impact on health. The variable phenotypes of nicotine dependence can be attributed to genetic variation. In addition, general precaution against nicotine use and abuse is necessary because individuals are usually unaware of their genetic susceptibilities. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>The Genetic Risks of Lung Cancer</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Longer term nicotine abuse generally leads to fatal diseases such as lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Therefore, it is imperative to determine genetic factors that contribute to disease risk in order to understand the mechanism of the disease. In </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">a genome-wide association study by Hung and others, researchers identified the genetic factors that increase the risk of lung cancer</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In the study, they focused on the A5A3B4 gene cluster region since it is known for its role in nicotine dependence. Researchers determined \u00a0a locus in the chromosome region 15q25 that is strongly associated with lung cancer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[10]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This genetic marker contains six genes that encode the nAChR subunits, an iron sense response element, a gene used in DNA repair, and a gene that has a currently unknown function. The names of these genes are </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CHRNA5</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CHRNA3</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CHRNB4</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">IREB2</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PSMA4</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and LOC123688</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [10]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The strongest evidence also indicated that the SNP in the CHRNA5 gene developed a non-synonymous variant that increased the risk of lung cancer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers concluded that these genetic variants influence an individual\u2019s risk and predisposition to lung cancer. Long term nicotine abuse, in the form of smoking, might increase one\u2019s chances of developing lung cancer in individuals who are genetically predisposed. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Neuropsychiatric Disorders Related to Chrna SNPs</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to lung cancer risk, genetic variation in \u00a0acetylcholine receptor genes also affects cognition. These effects increase the risk of developing other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and addiction. Researchers in a study led by </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mobascher</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> analyzed the genotypes of German individuals and compared the results to a cognitive processing test. As a part of the cognitive test, researchers used an electroencephalogram to record the individual\u2019s response to an auditory stimulus. The study found five SNPs within the CHRNA4 region that affected both the auditory system and cognitive processes [11]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers then examined the mean reaction time for three rs1044396 genotype groups (TT, CT, and CC). Although there was no statistical pattern in reaction time, there was a genotype sex interaction effect on reaction time. In females, the TT genotype was associated with a slower reaction time, while in males with TT had a faster reaction time. The results of this study found an SNP, specifically the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CHRNA4</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> rs1044396 T-allele, that is associated with a decrease in attentiveness </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[11]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In future studies, this allele can be used as a marker for risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and attention deficit disorders.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Visuospatial Attention</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A cognitive phenotype is defined as a distinct behavioral or cognitive characteristic that can be quantitatively measured. Cognitive phenotypes are used in neurobiology to diagnose and classify neuropsychiatric illness [12]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a study by Greenwood and co-authors, researchers examined the cognitive phenotype of visuospatial attention \u00a0produced by a SNP in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CHRNA4</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> gene. Components of the visuospatial attention depend on large scale neurocognitive networks that are moderated by the nAChRs [13]. Visuospatial attention strongly influences how quickly and accurately the brain evaluates and processes events. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers also studied how nicotinic stimulation affects the brain\u2019s networking. A genetic variant of CHRNA4 causes the C nucleotide to become a T nucleotide. Researchers found that the C allele is associated with an increased risk of nicotine addiction, while the T allele is protective against developing a nicotine addiction[8]. Supposedly, an individual with two TT alleles for the CHRNA4 gene will have an increased number of low affinity nicotine receptors which is less likely to activate a response in the neuron. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By administering nicotine to non-smokers and measuring behavioral and brain activities via imaging, they found that nicotine causes a narrow focus of attention by binding to the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Researchers found an association between attention and the nicotinic cholinergic system. They hypothesized that the T allele of CHRNA4 rs1044396 SNP is associated with the ability of focusing attention on a target inside a region at the expense of events outside the region. Individuals who are CHRNA T/T homozygous may take longer both to redirect their attention and to change their perspective of an event based on new information [13]. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Depression and Loneliness in Elderly Males</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genetic variants in acetylcholine receptors play a role in smoking behavior, cognitive function, and negative emotion. Since nAChRs are a type of receptors located in the brain and play a role in dopamine regulation, they can also play a role in the development of depression. A recent study found that a genetic variation in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CHRNA4 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(rs1044396) had an effect on attention and negative emotion in normal adults </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[14]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In this study, led by Tsai, researchers established a genotype-phenotype correlation between genetic variation in CHRNA4 (rs1044396) and cognitive function/depressed moods </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[14]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Researchers evaluated the level of loneliness, diagnosed potential depression, and assessed cognitive functions in elderly (63-98 years old) male smokers living in Veteran\u2019s Home in northern Taiwan in comparison to their genotype </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[14]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the study, the sample of elderly Chinese males with the CHRNA4 rs1044396 SNP and a C/C genotype had higher levels of depression and loneliness than the T allele carriers [14]. A possible explanation for the correlation between depression and nicotine dependence is that increased feelings of depression </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">or loneliness </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in C/C homozygotes can lead to an increase in use of nicotine as a self-medicating substance to relieve negative emotions. These results indicate that nAChR genetic variants have an effect on the mechanism of depression. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The results of these experiments support the idea that genetic variation heavily contributes to an individual\u2019s development of nicotine addiction. Minute molecular changes such as SNPs can have significant impacts on one\u2019s health. An individual\u2019s physical response to nicotine can vary depending on genetic variation in nicotine receptors. Surprisingly, Ehringer et al found that individuals who had developed nicotine addiction later in life reported an initial negative response of dizziness after smoking the first cigarette [3]. Genetic variation can play a role in initiating risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco consumption in youths. A study found that individuals with certain SNPs in the CHRNA5, A3, and B4 gene-cluster perceived nicotine and alcohol substances as low risks and therefore were more likely to participate in risky behavior [5]. Additionally, researchers identified that a single SNP in a protein-coding region of the CHRNA5 gene can result in a two-fold increase in the risk of developing nicotine dependence [7]. Nicotine addiction can lead to other smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer and peripheral arterial diseases. Therefore, genetic variation can also contribute to an individual\u2019s risk of contracting such diseases. General precaution against nicotine use and abuse is necessary since individuals are usually unaware of their genetic susceptibilities. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bibliography</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">D\u2019Souza MS, Markou A.

        "date": "02/05/2018",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">by Bukre Coskun,\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cell Biology \u201818</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Author\u2019s Note: I became interested in the immune system and the role of the thymus after taking an immunology class where I learned about how T-cells are distributed throughout our body. I wanted to explore this subject more after learning that the thymus, an organ that is integral to the production of T-cells, atrophies after puberty and eventually becomes inactive. \u00a0Here, I review a publication that describes how the concentration of T-cells in our body changes as we age. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1559\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The thymus plays a key role in the production and maturation of T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that identifies and kills cancer cells, virus-infected cells, or cells that are damaged in other ways. Hormones released by the thymus, such as thymosin, stimulate the maturation of T-cells before they are expelled into the bloodstream. Some T-cells migrate to lymph nodes where they become activated </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">when they are presented with antigens by MHC class II molecules by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Active T-cells then divide and help identify and kill pathogens, activate B cells to produce antibodies, and build an army of memory T-cells to respond quickly to secondary exposure to the infection. While most organs grow with us as we age, the thymus slowly shrinks after puberty and is replaced with fatty tissue. Therefore, aging is associated with the deterioration of the thymus that leads to the decreased production of new T-lymphocytes and thus, decreased immune function. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thome et al. from Columbia University recently published a paper in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Science Immunology</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> describing how compartmentalization of T-cells in lymph nodes allows for naive T-cells to be maintained throughout the human lifespan. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> While most immunological studies rely on blood samples to identify circulating T-cells, which contain only 3% of the total T-cells in the body, Thome et al. used human tissue to analyze cell composition. While some T-cells are found in circulating blood, they are mostly found in lymphoid tissues located at various submucosal membranes throughout our body, such as those associated with our lungs and eyes. Analyzing human tissue allowed scientists to characterize the other 97% of total T-cells in the body, uncovering more information about T-cell lineage and sustenance. Human tissues were obtained from organ donors through the organization LiveOnNY, and from discarded tissue from patients undergoing pediatric cardiac surgery through the Human Studies Core of the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology. Lymphocytes were then isolated from the various lymphoid tissues obtained, including the thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To identify how the production of T-cells changes over time, researchers studied the presence of T-cells in tissue samples from a large range of ages. In order to measure thymic output of T-cells, researchers marked the differences\u00a0between immature T-cells, cells that had recently exited the thymus, and long-lived naive cells in the periphery. The team identified new na\u00efve T-cells by looking for episomal circular DNA (TRECs) formed during recombination of a gene in the T-cell receptor. TRECs are stable and not duplicated during mitosis, so they diminish with each cellular division. By determining </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">REC content using a PCR-based approach</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the researchers determined that different sites had concentrations of naive T-cells that varied based on the age of the donor. For instance, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pediatric patients had more T cells in the thymus, while older children had more T cells in the lung-draining lymph node</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">s. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, there was a decline in the thymic production of na\u00efve T-cells after the age of 40. This supports the age-related regression of the thymus and the correlated decrease in naive T-cell output. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This finding suggests that naive T-cells are selective about where in the body they travel to as we age, although the mechanism for this is unclear. More interestingly, the study found that na\u00efve cells are not as mobile as previously thought. Instead, they travel only to specific sites where they nest and receive signals to expand in the vicinity of these \u201cnests\u201d. Thus, T-cells observed to be circulating in high numbers during childhood are naive T-cells in transit to their lymphoid homes rather than naive T-cells migrating between tissues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understanding how T-cells differentiate and populate different tissue sites, such as lymph nodes, after leaving the thymus may allow us to personalize immunotherapies and vaccines. Furthermore, studying how aging correlates with the shrinkage of the thymus and the reduction in T-cell diversity may help us address increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, infection, and cancer in older individuals. In fact, it may even be possible to preserve T-cell functionality by slowing, stopping or reversing thymic recession. Continued research on the mechanisms and spatiality of our immune system will help advance new approaches for extending immune competency in older individuals. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Miller, Jacques FAP. \u201cImmunological function of the thymus.\u201d\u00a0</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Lancet</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0278.7205 (1961): 748-749.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kaufmann, Gilbert R., et al. \u201cRelative significance of different pathways of immune reconstitution in HIV type 1 infection as estimated by mathematical modeling.\u201d\u00a0</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AIDS research and human retroviruses</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a017.2 (2001): 147-159.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chinn, Ivan K., et al. \u201cChanges in primary lymphoid organs with aging.\u201d\u00a0</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Seminars in immunology</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

After conducting an interview with the patient, I became intrigued by the controversial aspects of her ailment, and drew on research to better understand the scientific context of chronic pain. I hope that my reflection at the end raises questions that readers are also thinking, and that these questions could spur readers to learn more about the subject.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1564\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pain is frequently characterized as a visible symptom\u2014 a purple bruise, the \u201couch\u201d exclaimed after bumping into a table corner. We may wince simply at the sight of pain, and observing pain in action makes most of us feel empathy for its victims. Consequently, pain rarely brings to mind something invisible. But pain can go undetected by the naked eye, as exemplified by chronic pain, which is widely regarded as an invisible ailment. Patients not only battle persistent pain that lasts months to years but also cope with no visible signs of injury.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I first learned about the subject of this reflective case study, a female student at the University of California, Davis, I was intrigued by the invisible aspect of her chronic pain condition. I decided to conduct an interview with the patient and discovered other engaging aspects of her experience. Prior to developing chronic pain, the patient described herself as a \u201cnormal college student\u201d who strived to keep different areas of her life in balance [1]. Although she spent hours on schoolwork each day, she always made time for her hobbies and social life. Her daily routine also consisted of exercising regularly and getting enough sleep nightly.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This routine changed when the patient began her sophomore year in college with a heavy course workload. Feeling immense pressure to do well, the patient spent extra time to manage her studies, which often meant late nights and putting schoolwork as her sole focus. One night, she had just finished studying when she felt a dull ache spread across her shoulders. She assumed it was her stiff posture that caused the problem and didn\u2019t think much of it, dismissing the pain easily. Her shoulders had never been injured before so she didn\u2019t see reason to be alarmed; but the shoulder pain persisted, for weeks and then months. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When asked why she didn\u2019t seek medical attention right away or try to alleviate her pain, the patient replied that she didn\u2019t consider her shoulder pain to be a \u201cserious problem\u201d [1]. While the lack of visible injury contributed to this belief, the patient also deemed her age to be a factor. She did not think it was plausible for her nineteen-year-old self to develop a severe pain condition that is commonly associated with older adults, particularly in television commercials for pain relief medication.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The patient\u2019s misconceptions about chronic pain are typical and have similarly caused other chronic pain patients to delay treatment and professional help. While chronic pain can develop after a major injury or illness, such as a back injury or shingles, it can also arise without a known cause [2]. Pain is the body\u2019s way of alerting a person that something is wrong, and it is normal for the body to send pain signals to the brain when someone is injured or ill. However, pain that lingers after an injury or illness is abnormal. Chronic pain is defined as pain that extends longer than three months, and could even persist for years [2]. Anyone can develop chronic pain but it is more common in older adults [2]. It is not a normal part of aging. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although the patient experienced chronic shoulder pain in the absence of a past injury, she believes her stress levels during sophomore year contributed significantly to her condition. The patient could manage her classes by adhering to a rigorous studying routine but her efforts took a toll on her health. It is not yet fully clear to researchers how stress and pain are related; however, evidence shows that stress and pain can influence each other dramatically [3]. Stress not only has an emotional impact on a person but can cause physical pain as well. Furthermore, studies support the conclusion that emotional processes in the brain can increase pain [4]. The brain is a key player in determining how people perceive pain because the nervous system regulates pain and its pathways [5]. The brain always tries to inhibit pain signals; however, if a person is stressed, the brain\u2019s ability to filter these signals is hindered [5]. Consequently, the sensation of pain can actually be increased due to stress [5].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The patient suffered a year of shoulder pain before deciding to visit her physician. She realized her condition was serious when the pain became too difficult to ignore and endure; the bursts of pain gradually became more frequent, spreading to her neck during certain occurrences. Even sitting down for a short period would cause an ache to emerge in her shoulders. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After conducting library research, I determined that the patient\u2019s condition can be classified as nociceptive pain, one of two generally accepted categories of chronic pain that is characterized by a dull ache [6]. Nociceptive pain \u201carises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue\u201d and is caused by the activation of nociceptors [6]. It\u2019s possible that the patient\u2019s stress posed a threat to tissue damage, thereby triggering the nociceptors. Nociceptors are sensory receptors that detect signals from damaged tissue or threat of damage in the body [7]. These sensors of the pain pathway are located in the skin, as well as in other structures such as blood vessels and tendons [8]. Tissue damage and the threat of damage trigger the activation of nociceptors, and the pain signals travel from the nociceptors, through the sensory nerves, and up the spinal cord to the thalamus in the brain, which works to relay sensory signals in the brain [8]. The pain signal is then sent to the cerebral cortex, which is the part of the brain that processes thought [8]. Nociceptors play an integral role in sounding the pain alarm in the body, in response to highly specific stimulation. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the patient finally visited the doctor\u2019s office, her physician prescribed two pain relievers\u2013 ibuprofen and acetaminophen\u2013and provided little guidance for long-term treatment. Without a formal diagnosis from her physician, the patient came to her own conclusion that her shoulder pain was associated with stress. The patient explained that she feels the impact of her shoulder pain most aggressively before studying for exams because she is stressed out about doing well. The dull pain hits her shoulders in frequent bursts and she temporarily relieves the pain with Bengay, a type of analgesic cream used to alleviate muscle aches. She clarified that she decided not to take ibuprofen after a while because she \u201cdidn\u2019t like taking pills all the time\u201d [1]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After forming her own conclusion, the patient reigned in her unhealthy study habits, which \u00a0subsequently decreased her stress levels. She now possesses coping methods and outlets for her stress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI manage my stress by hanging out with friends, going to the gym to exercise, taking study breaks, and studying early for exams. I don\u2019t stay up late anymore. I don\u2019t think my body can handle it,\u201d the patient explained [1]. Although she still experiences chronic shoulder pain, the frequency of pain outbursts have decreased, and the pain is now localized to her left shoulder rather than spread across both shoulders. She hopes that with time, her shoulder pain could be managed to the point that she will no longer require any treatment.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The patient\u2019s experience with chronic pain raises the importance of acknowledging the invisible aspect of certain illnesses. Although she did not show any visible signs of injury, the patient still suffered pain that was real and required attention. It is interesting that what is invisible to a third party observer could be invisible to the patient as well, and patients could be just as likely to believe that their condition is not serious because they do not visibly observe that something is wrong. The patient\u2019s initial dismissal of her condition due to preconceived ideas about chronic shoulder pain brings up the problem of harmful misconceptions in medicine. These misconceptions about certain illnesses merit attention because they have been shown to be potentially damaging to patients, and could delay timely diagnosis and treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The relationship between stress and chronic pain in the patient\u2019s experience demonstrates how a negative emotion like stress could manifest itself physically in the body and cause harm. It is notable that for the patient, coping with stress and learning how to manage her stress levels alleviated her chronic pain without medicinal treatment. Could self-treatment yield just as successful results in other chronic pain patients, given that pain is a very personal and subjective experience? Most certainly, the patient\u2019s case speaks to the important relationship between the mind and the body. Because the patient managed her emotional health and actively sought to reduce her stress, her body was able to heal as well.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[1] Guo, Cathy (Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology department, University of California, Davis, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Davis, CA).

He instructed his students to write an essay exploring this role in any way they wanted, and I chose to focus on the link between MCT1 and cancer. I enjoyed sifting through multiple strands of evidence for the reasons behind this link \u2014 strands that oftentimes were not in agreement with one another.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1613\"></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), as their name implies, are proteins that transport molecules with just one carboxylate group \u2014 such as lactate and pyruvate \u2014 across the cell membrane (1). This transport is proton-linked in that the concentration gradients of protons and monocarboxylates determine the direction of net transport (1). There exist several different MCT isoforms, each with different biochemical properties and functions (2). For instance, isoforms 1-4 play key roles in energy metabolism in the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart, in addition to T-lymphocyte activation and bowel metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (2). MCT8, on the other hand, aids in thyroid hormone transport across the blood-brain barrier, while MCT10 facilitates the transport of aromatic amino acids (2). Notably, MCT1 in particular has been linked to cancer progression, and several mechanisms through which it does so have been proposed over the years (11-22). MCT1\u2019s role as a pH regulator, lactate and pyruvate transporter, and growth and transcription factor activator may contribute to its ability to bolster cancer cell activity (11-22).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>pH Regulator</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Solid tumor cells in hypoxic microenvironments rely upon anaerobic glycolysis to synthesize ATP (3). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike normal cells, however, cancer cells have been observed to perform the metabolically inefficient aerobic glycolysis in the presence of oxygen </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(4). This phenomenon was coined the Warburg effect after Otto Warburg, who first reported it in the 1920s, and it has confounded scientists ever since (5). In the presence of oxygen, most cells rely upon mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in order to synthesize enough ATP to sustain themselves, as this pathway can produce up to 36 ATP molecules per glucose (6, 7). In glycolysis, by contrast, each glucose yields only two ATP molecules (7). This fact makes the Warburg effect seem paradoxical, as the rapid proliferation of cancer cells would indicate that they have high energy demands (4). Multiple explanations have been proposed for this phenomenon; whatever the reasons behind it, though, it is key that tumor cells exhibit a high glycolytic rate with or without oxygen present (7).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> In this context, MCT1\u2019s relationship to increased cancer cell development and progression can be explored. The high glycolytic rate of cancer cells leads to the production of hydrogen ions and lactic acid among other things, the consequence being decreased local pH (8). Acidification of the intracellular environment has been linked to cellular apoptosis, as well as the activation of endonucleases that induce DNA fragmentation (9). Extracellularly, increased acidity has the opposite effect: it aids in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells (9). As such, mechanisms to maintain the pH of cancer cells are necessary for their survival and success. Where MCT1 comes in thus becomes apparent given the importance of pH regulation in cancer cells: by shuttling lactate and protons, which are tied to cellular pH, MCT1 confers these cells with the ability to survive and even thrive in acidic environments (10). One way in which MCT1 provides an advantage to tumor cells is through pH regulation, an ability that goes hand in hand with its co-transport of protons.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Lactate transporter</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond its maintenance of pH, MCT1\u2019s transport of lactate in particular contributes to its correlation with increased cancer cell activity. As aforementioned, the increased glycolytic rate of cancer cells results in high lactate levels (7). In order for continuous glycolysis to occur, therefore, the transport of this lactate is essential (11). In this context, the association between MCT1\u2019s role as a lactate transporter and its utility for cancer cells is clear (11). This association has been explored by Payen and colleagues, who found that lactate release decreased and intracellular lactate accumulation increased both when MCT1 was silenced and when it was deleted in cancer cells (12). Significantly, the glycolytic efficiency of the cells decreased when MCT1 expression was inhibited (12). Lactate itself has also been linked to tumors: not only is its abundance an indicator of metastases and cancer patient survival, but it also has been shown to facilitate cell migration and cluster formation (13). In other words, lactate level both reflects and increases cancer cell malignancy (14). The association between lactate abundance and tumor potency again points to the importance of MCT1\u2019s ability to transport lactate.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Pyruvate transporter</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to lactate, MCT1 transports pyruvate, and this aspect of it offers an alternative explanation for</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> its boosting of cancer cell activity</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In one study, Sun Hong and colleagues found that inhibiting MCT1 reduced pyruvate rather than lactate export in breast cancer cells (15). This study implies that MCT1\u2019s role as a pyruvate transporter lies at the heart of its contribution to tumor growth (15). Sun Hong et al. began by examining gene expression to confirm the correlation between MCT1 and the glycolytic phenotype in breast cancer cells; thereafter they analyzed normal and malignant breast and lung tissues, ultimately determining that MCT1 protein levels were elevated in the malignant tissues (15). Following these initial findings, in order to investigate MCT1\u2019s effect on metabolic phenotype, they generated breast cancer cell lines in which MCT1 expression was knocked down (15). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The results suggested that MCT1\u2019s mediation of pyruvate export is a key function for it in glycolytic breast cancer cells \u2014 and that its mediation of lactate export is not </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(15). Whether the same phenomenon holds true for other cancer types such as colon, lung, or prostate cancer has yet to be investigated (15). It should also be noted that the cancer cells used in this study expressed higher levels of another isoform, MCT4, than those in other studies (15). This fact may explain discrepancies between these studies regarding the mechanism by which MCT1 aids cancer cells.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Growth factor activator</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Still other researchers have found evidence that MCT1 confers advantages to cancer cells independently of its transporter activity. Gray et al., for instance, found an association between MCT1 expression and growth factor-induced tumor cell motility (16). In one study, Gray and colleagues knocked down MCT1 expression and subsequently observed a change in two signaling pathways, called the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor pathways, both of which are important for the movement of tumor cells (16). Inhibiting MCT1, the researchers found, decreased the activity of both EGF and HGF as measured by the effects on tumor cell scattering and wound healing (16). Notably, the knockdown of MCT1 expression did not affect the net transport of lactic acid, likely due to redundancy between MCT1 and MCT4 (16). These results indicate it was MCT1\u2019s relationship with the aforementioned growth factors that was responsible for the change in cell motility, a relationship independent of its activity as a transporter (16).</span></p>\n<p><h4>Transcription factor activator</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Further studies have indicated yet another function for MCT1 in cancer cell metastasis beyond transport. These studies concern the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) pathway, which has been shown to play a crucial role in cancer development and progression (17). Through western blotting analysis, Zhao and colleagues demonstrated in one study that several human osteosarcoma cell lines express MCT1</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(18). Thereafter they knocked down MCT1 expression in such cell lines and observed a suppression in cell growth both </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vitro </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">following this knockdown (18). Moreover, they found that inhibition of MCT1 decreased other metastatic activities such as wound healing, invasion, and migration in osteosarcoma (18). In this study, Zhao et al. focused on NF-\u03baB signaling to explain their findings, as its hyperactivation has been linked to the enhancement of tumor cell survival and metastasis (18). By either downregulating MCT1 with the specific inhibitor \u03b1-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate or suppressing it through RNA interference, they found they could decrease the activity of the NF-\u03baB pathway, which in turn impaired the function of the osteosarcoma cells (18). MCT1\u2019s ties to NF-\u03baB thus play a part in its facilitation of cancer cell activity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Based upon the work of Zhao and others, Payen and colleagues further explored the connection between the NF-\u03baB pathway and MCT1\u2019s function with regard to tumor cells (12). They found that dosing carcinoma cells with the MCT1 inhibitors AR-C155858 or AZD3965 did not impair either cell migration or invasion; importantly, they noted that these inhibitors did not affect MCT1 expression in the cells (12). From this latter point, Payen and colleagues hypothesized that MCT1 expression is in fact responsible for controlling cancer cell migration \u2014 and that its activity as a transporter is not (12). They subsequently generated a transport-inactive version of MCT1 and expressed it in cells in which they had deleted the active version of MCT1 (12). What they found upon doing so was that migration was restored in these cells, implying that MCT1\u2019s promotion of cancer cell migration is indeed independent of its transporter activity (12). Following these results, they activated NF-\u03baB in MCT1-deficient cells and found that cell migration ability was then rescued; when they treated these cells with a highly specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, the opposite effect was observed (12). All in all, these experiments indicate that MCT1 controls cancer cell migration through its connection to NF-\u03baB.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Association with CD147</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One final explanation for MCT1\u2019s promotion of cancer cell activity is its relationship with the chaperone protein CD147. CD147 expression, which is elevated in carcinomas, is positively correlated with tumor recurrence and progression and negatively correlated with cancer patient survival (19). Because CD147 is essential for the transport of MCT1 to the plasma membrane, inhibiting CD147 expression disrupts the function of MCT1 \u2014 and, some have proposed, cancer cell activity as a result (10, 20). Others have suggested that the stable complexes that MCT1 and CD147 form with one another are a more significant factor in MCT1\u2019s promotion of tumor cell progression (12). As CD147 has been found to activate NF-\u03baB in cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts, some researchers have posited that these MCT1-CD147 complexes boost cancer cell activity through CD147-dependent activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway (12). Overall, MCT1\u2019s association with CD147 may add to its facilitation of tumor progression.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MCT1\u2019s ability to transport lactate and pyruvate, in addition to activate growth and transcription factors, may play a key part in the aid it provides to cancer cells. Further studies of the correlation between MCT1 and tumor progression may provide insight into the ways in which it can be used in a chemotherapeutic fashion. Already several attempts have been made to assess the effects of various MCT1 inhibitors on cancer cell metabolism (21). The case of AZD3965, a selective MCT1 inhibitor, illustrates the necessity of further research into MCT1\u2019s facilitation of tumor development and progression. One study demonstrated that inhibiting MCT1 with AZD3965 activates glycolysis, resulting in intracellular lactate accumulation (22). But another study showed that AZD3965 does not affect glycolytic activity or lactate levels in cancer cells; instead, it appeared only to inhibit tumors through the disruption of pyruvate export (15). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It seems that more work must be done in order to understand the metabolic changes induced by this inhibitor and any others, work that will be crucial in assessing their potential as chemotherapeutic drugs. The part MCT plays in cancer maintenance and progression also appears to vary depending on the type of cancer; conflicting results and lack of functional studies warrant additional investigation into the matter (10). In the future, more progress may be made with respect to targeting MCT1 as a means to halt tumor progression \u2014 and grasping MCT1\u2019s exact role in this progression is the first step toward such progress.</span></p>\n<p><h4></h4></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Halestrap, Andrew P., and Nigel T.

After taking a class focusing on neurons, it made me curious as to how the sensory abilities of teeth play out. I was surprised to read online a specific type of cell is involved with tooth sensitivity, and delved into research articles from there. I also wanted to highlight the future implications these studies help shed light on, such that future research will help clarify our understanding on topics like this.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1617\"></span></p>\n<p><h4></h4><h4>Introduction</h4><h4></h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Odontoblasts are cells found within sites of tooth development during the entire human lifespan. Their counterpart, odontoclasts, are involved in absorption of deciduous teeth during normal development (Dixon </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2000). <img class=\"alignright\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://snag.gy/EKQcJy.jpg\"/>The primary function of odontoblasts is dentinogenesis, although an important secondary role involved in sensation is highly implicated. This is supported by Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m\u2019s hydrodynamic theory of tooth sensitivity, the leading theory on how odontoblasts are involved in sensory perception (Black </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 2014). The theory suggests a signal transduction process, where changes in dentinal fluid from the external environment can stimulate the odontoblasts near the pulpal end of the dentinal tubule, leading their afferent myelinated A fibers to send sensory signals through the trigeminal nerve to the brain (Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m 1966). More recent studies have examined the specific molecules and channels involved behind the odontoblast and its initiation of action potentials (Ikeda </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2017).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These studies, which will be examined as follows, have clarified roles of the molecules involved with odontoblasts. Many of these studies support Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m\u2019s hydrodynamic theory and highlight the advantages of further research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><h4>Tooth Anatomy</h4><h4></h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each of a human\u2019s regular thirty-two teeth are anatomically divided into two main parts \u2013 the root, which consists of the lower part of the tooth surrounded by bone, and the crown, which is superior to the root and surrounded by gums. A layer of enamel covers the anatomical crown of the tooth, while cementum covers the anatomical root of the tooth. Underneath the enamel and cementum is dentin, a calcified tissue that surrounds the inner center pulp, as shown in Figure 1.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has been well-documented that a major role of odontoblasts is dentinogenesis, the formation of dentin (Bleicher 2014). Specifically, oligopotent neural crest stem cells give rise to odontoblasts.<img class=\"alignleft\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i.snag.gy/WmBRcE.jpg\"/>After the odontoblasts mature, their cell bodies remain in the pulp\u2019s outer wall, forming a boundary between the dentin and pulp, as shown in Figure 2. Located within the dentin are dentinal tubules, which extend from the outer pulp wall to the border of cementum or enamel. Due to the microscopic nature of these structures, their exact functions have remained unclear in past studies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><h4>Mechano-sensory Secondary Role</h4><h4></h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is now known that unmyelinated C sensory nerve fibers surround odontoblasts\u2019 cell bodies while myelinated A fibers surround their processes, and that odontoblasts\u2019 processes enter dentinal tubules (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). This unique position allows for odontoblasts to not only sense external stimuli, but also transient changes inside the pulp. Dentinal fluid inside the dentinal tubules allows for detection of movement. Although it has been difficult to properly examine, previous research indicates dentinal fluid has an elevated concentration of potassium compared to control serum (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The association of nerves with odontoblasts has since been highly documented. Trigeminal nerve fibers form the sensory axonal network around odontoblasts (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). Primary cilium, an organelle involved in sensory transduction, has been regularly identified throughout human odontoblasts, although the specific mechanistic roles are still being researched (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). One hypothesis suggests that odontoblasts\u2019 cilia in the cell bodies sense pulp microenvironment (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). Taken together, these data support the secondary role odontoblasts have as mechano-sensory receptors through axonal signal transduction pathways.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><h4>Cell Membrane Channels and Signal Transduction</h4><h4></h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and chloride-selective channels have been documented in the odontoblast membrane, suggesting a possible role in action potentials in odontoblasts. In addition to the typical cell membrane channels, K</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ca </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and TREK-1 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">two major mechano-sensitive ion channels </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2013 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">have been highlighted in odontoblasts (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). \u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Calcium-activated potassium channels in odontoblasts have been suggested to play a role in mechano-sensitivity detection when the channels activated in response to membrane stretch, revealing a potential mechanism for transducing mechanical stimulus into electrical signals (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). While the exact mechanism behind the signal transduction has not been uncovered, one theory suggests that an increase of intracellular calcium due to mechanical stretch on the tooth could open odontoblasts\u2019 K</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> channels and cause depolarization at their nerve endings (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). This theory is supported by a previous study that induced tooth pain sensation after inserting potassium agents into dentinal cavities (Markowitz and Pashley 2008). Another study suggests an elaborate ATP-mediated signaling pathway is potentially at work, where metabotropic and ionotropic ATP receptors were found in odontoblasts (Chung </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2016). ATP-induced calcium currents caused activation of ionotropic and metabotropic ATP receptors, which provided a basis for sensory processing and suggested the possibility of secondary messenger involvement (Chung </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2016). The precise physiological role of the ATP receptors in relation to the K</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> channels remains unclear. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another major mechano-sensitive channel seen in odontoblasts are the TREK-1 potassium channels. These channels are open at resting membrane potential and gated by various stimuli such as stretch, heat, and changes in pH. These channels are more concentrated towards the coronal portion of the dentinal tubule and less common towards the pulpal region (Bleicher </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2009). This specific distribution inside the dentinal tubule suggests a highly regulated mechanism behind the signal transduction and potentially different levels of regulation.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><h4>Transient Receptor Potential Channels</h4><h4></h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several lines of research found transient receptor potential (TRP) channels to also be involved in the signal transduction pathway. TRP channels regulate the entry of ions like calcium, which in turn regulates sensory functions in odontoblasts. Ichinohe </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> found that TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV4 (channels of the TRP subfamily) functioned in the transduction of mechanical and osmotic stimuli, while TRPM8 was not active in this process (2013). It should be noted, however, that these results were only found on mouse odontoblasts. In a recent study performed on freshly isolated native human odontoblasts, Ikeda </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> found that TRPM8 (transient receptor potential melastatin 8) plays a role in detecting external cold stimulation (2017). This finding highlights the important principle that data from non-human models may not be representative of normal human model function. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span></i><h4>Excitatory Substance P</h4><h4></h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although human models are ideal to uncover the mechanisms behind the signal transduction pathway, a few other key discoveries have been made through Black </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\u2019s study on narwhal\u2019s odontoblasts (2014). As mentioned earlier, the microscopic nature of the dentinal tubules has made it difficult to uncover the molecules at play. As such, narwhals with large tusks measuring anywhere between 1.5 to 3.1 meters on average have offered more complete imaging of the dentinal tubule network (Black </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 2014). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As discussed earlier, it is known that both myelinated A fibers and unmyelinated C sensory fibers are found around the odontoblasts, organized in different layers (Black </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 2014). A unique characteristic of the C fibers is that they contain Substance P, a neuropeptide that coexists with glutamate in primary afferents and is ultimately involved in pain perception (Black </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 2014). Immunohistochemical studies in narwhals found localization of substance P largely restricted to odontoblasts\u2019 cell bodies and processes in the dentinal tubules, suggesting a potential role in promoting excitatory impulses and action potentials to the CNS (Black </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 2014).</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It should be noted that narwhal\u2019s dentinal tubules are open to the environment, unlike human enamel, which occludes the dentinal tubules. As such, the mechanistic properties of odontoblasts in narwhals may differ, although the confirmation and localization of Substance P in narwhals are useful for future human-model studies. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><h4>New Research Findings</h4><h4></h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recent cutting-edge research suggests aspirin could have restorative effects on tooth decay. The method behind this research involves increasing the expression of odontoblast genes, ultimately enhancing the odontoblasts\u2019 ability to make dentin (Du e</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">t al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2017). Aspirin not only promotes dentin formation, but also inhibits inflammation (Du e</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">t al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2017). Since tooth decay yields significant financial costs through requiring additional dental treatments, this finding has significant implications worldwide through financial aspects and providing alternatives to current treatments.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Low power laser therapy is a recent innovative approach designed to regenerate dentin. The concept behind this involves laser activated transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), which differentiates neural crest cells into odontoblasts, promoting dentinogenesis and possibly mechano-sensory abilities (Arany </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">et al. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2014). The implications behind the effects laser activated TGF-\u03b21could have on the odontoblasts\u2019 mechano-sensory abilities are not clear yet. Thus, as we improve our understanding of the structures and ions involved in odontoblasts\u2019 signal transduction pathway, we can better understand how these new treatments interact with odontoblasts and dentin.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><h4>Conclusion</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While significant progress has been made in discovering microstructural elements involved with odontoblasts, greater clarification is needed. A closer look at the precise mechanisms that occur during the signal transduction process is necessary to solidify odontoblasts\u2019 secondary role as mechano-sensory cells. In particular, we now have a greater understanding of the channels at play as well as confirmation of structures, such as Substance P, TREK-1 channels, and primary cilium. Transient Receptor Potential Channels highlight the fact that there may be multiple different signal transduction mechanisms at play dependent on the external stimuli, such as TRPM8, which is specific in detecting external cold stimulation. Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m\u2019s hydrodynamic theory of tooth sensitivity is supported to this day. Recent potential treatments to dentin regeneration and alleviation of tooth decay demand a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved with odontoblasts as well as other cells in the human tooth. </span></p>\n<h4 data-fontsize=\"18\" data-lineheight=\"27\"><h4>References</h4></h4>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Arany, P., Barcellos-Hoff, M., Chen, A., Cho, A., Hahm, E., Hamblin, M., Huang, G., Hunt, T., Kulkarni, A., Mooney, D., Padwa, B., Shin, K., Sidhu, G., and Weaver, J. 2014.

One area of research that particularly fascinates me involves the use of microbes that naturally inhabit the human body to treat infections and diseases. I wanted to share the findings of a research study focused on one such microbe, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, because of the significant implications and potential for further development demonstrated by the research findings. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1691\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Human skin harbors diverse microbial communities, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is one of the predominant bacterial species that colonizes the normal skin surface. Some strains of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are commensal and therefore benefit from inhabiting the human skin environment but do not harm the host. In a recently published research study, Nakatsuji et al. (2018) reported that specific commensal strains of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> produce 6-N-hydroxyaminopurine (6-HAP), a molecule that is capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis selectively in tumor cells. The ability of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to defend against tumor growth possesses important implications in the future treatment of skin cancer. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6-HAP interferes with DNA synthesis because its molecular structure mimics that of adenine. Nakatsuji et al. found that in the presence of 6-HAP, DNA extension was blocked when the template required adenine to pair with thymidine but functioned normally during cytosine-guanine base pairing. Furthermore, 6-HAP disrupted DNA synthesis in a melanoma cell line but did not affect Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocytes (NHEKs). NHEKs are not susceptible to 6-HAP activity because they contain mitochondrial amidoxime reducing components (mARCs), powerful enzymes that reduce imitative compounds like 6-HAP to normal nucleotide bases. Consequently, 6-HAP is rendered to adenine in the presence of mARCs and DNA synthesis functions as normal within the cell. As expected, the expression of mARCs was discovered to be much higher in NHEKs than in the 6-HAP-sensitive melanoma cell line. The study suggests that 6-HAP is thus able to specifically target skin tumor cells to suppress their proliferation in culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nakatsuji et al. also investigated 6-HAP\u2019s ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Among mice injected with melanoma cells, some received 6-HAP injections while others received mock injections. The results showed that tumor size was suppressed by more than 60% in mice that were administered 6-HAP compared to those that were not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The research team conducted further experiments to examine how </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> affects the skin surface. Scientists topically applied </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on hairless mice before exposing them to UV radiation for 12 weeks. While some mice received a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> strain that produces 6-HAP, others got a strain that does not. Researchers found that mice colonized with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that makes 6-HAP formed tumors of significantly smaller size compared to mice colonized with the control strain. Predictably, the mice that received treatment from the 6-HAP-producing strain also developed fewer tumors overall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The research findings highlight the potential for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to protect against tumor growth and carry significant implications in the future treatment of skin cancer. Perhaps 6-HAP could be extracted from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> strains and harnessed to synthesize skin cancer drugs. It is also plausible for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to be transferred from individuals bearing 6-HAP-producing strains to those who do not, as a way to ward off skin cancer. For now, these ideas are merely possibilities as additional studies are necessary to understand the biosynthesis and regulation of 6-HAP in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">S. epidermidis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, as well as the interactions between bacteria and host.

Last fall, I decided to research idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after my grandfather was hospitalized and diagnosed with it over the previous summer. I quickly discovered that there wasn\u2019t much research on the disease itself or how to treat it due to its rarity. The purpose of this literature review is to inform others about idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and to encourage further research on the subject. With time, this research could be vital in saving lives just like that of my grandfather.</p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4>\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an irreversible and fatal disease of the lungs. Although it has been associated with genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking, environmental factors (e.g. occupational exposure to gases, smoke, chemicals, or dusts) and other conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the mechanism and causes of IPF are not yet fully understood by researchers. However, recent studies have provided evidence that IPF may be caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the inhalation of chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants. These chemicals have been identified as polymethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG-P), didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), oligo(2-(2-ethoxy)-ethoxyethyl) guanidinium chloride (PGH), and a mixture of chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) and methylisothiazolinone (MIT). It has been suggested that the generation of ROS by these chemicals is responsible for damaging the cellular structures of the lungs and triggering the development of IPF through the activation of the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway. Studies have also shown microRNAs to be key regulators of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway and the development of the disease. Several promising future treatments of IPF involve the inhibition of the TGF-\ua7b5 signaling pathway either through the administration of drugs containing sesquiterpene lactones, matrine, or oridonin compounds; or through the replenishment or inhibition of certain miRNAs. The studies detailed here highlight the importance of further research on IPF.<br/>\n<h4>Keywords</h4> idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis | PHMG-P | TGF\u03b2 | miRNA</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4>\nPulmonary fibrosis is an irreversible, fatal disease that results in scarring of the lung tissue and decreased function of the lungs. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis simply means that the cause is unknown. Patients with IPF typically experience difficulty breathing, with death caused by either respiratory failure or incurrent pneumonia. [1] The disease is characterized by marked collagen deposition and other alterations to the extracellular matrix (ECM), a network of macromolecules that provide structural support to the lungs. [1] These alterations to the ECM remodel and stiffen the lung\u2019s airspaces and tissues. [1] It is also characterized by diffuse interstitial inflammation and respiratory dysfunction. [2] Although its cause remains unknown, it is believed that the main steps in the pathogenesis of IPF are initiated by the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\ua7b5) signaling pathway and involves the migration, proliferation, and activation of lung fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts. [3] Fibroblasts are cells that have a high ability to proliferate and to produce ECM and fibrogenic cytokines. [3] Fibrogenic cytokines are multifunctional immunoregulatory proteins that contribute to the inflammatory cell recruitment and activation needed to promote the development of fibrosis. [4] These cytokines can activate myofibroblasts, which are primarily responsible for the synthesis and excessive accumulation of ECM components, collagen and fibronectin, during the repair process that leads to fibrosis. [5], [6]</p>\n<p>A 2011 outbreak of pulmonary fibrosis in South Korea prompted an onslaught of research as to how IPF may be caused and treated. [7] Specifically, this research has provided evidence that certain chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants can cause IPF through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have a powerful oxidizing capability that can induce the destruction of cellular and subcellular structures in the lung, including DNA, proteins, lipids, cell membranes, and mitochondria. [8] This damage caused by ROS has been found to promote the activation of the TGF-\ua7b5 signaling pathway and the development of numerous characteristics associated with IPF. [4] This research has been invaluable for the discovery of new potential treatments for patients with IPF.</p>\n<p><h4>Potential inducers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</h4>\nAfter the 2011 outbreak in South Korea, researchers were able to find a connection between IPF and exposure to chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants, such as those found in humidifiers and pools. They have suspected that these chemicals can cause pulmonary fibrosis by infiltrating the respiratory system as aerosol particles to induce cellular damage. The chemicals polymethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG-P), didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), oligo (2-(2-ethoxy) ethoxyethyl guanidinium chloride (PGH), and the mixture of chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) and methylisothiazolinone (MIT) attracted particular interest.</p>\n<p>In a study evaluating registered lung disease cases in South Korea, it was revealed that 70 percent of registered patients that suffered from IPF or other forms of household humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury had used humidifier disinfectants containing the chemicals PHMG, PGH, or a mix of CMIT and MIT prior to their development of the disease [7] It was determined that the aerosol water droplets emitted by the humidifiers may have acted as carriers to deliver these chemicals into the lower part of the respiratory system, causing humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury. [7] It was also revealed that most of the affected patients in the study had used humidifier disinfectant containing the chemical PHMG. [7]</p>\n<p>Another study detailed that even slight exposure to PHMG could cause cell death triggered by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). [8] Injury by ROS is typically followed by a fibrotic repair process involving increases in TGF-\ua7b5 expression, increased fibronectin, collagen synthesis, and a marked increase in the deposition of the ECM, all key characteristics of IPF. [4]</p>\n<p>One way that ROS promote ECM deposition and IPF is by activating transcription factors like nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB). [4] NF-\u03baB is a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines that is typically bound to a cytoplasmic inhibitor. [9] One study found that exposure to the biocide (substance that destroys/prevents growth in organisms) and preservative PHMB was able to generate significant ROS levels and activate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through the degradation of its inhibitor. [10] This is significant because the activation of proinflammatory cytokines is necessary for the recruitment and activation of myofibroblasts responsible for the increased ECM deposition that is characteristic of IPF patients. PHMB is also a cationic chemical and there is evidence that it can bind to negatively charged mucins, located within the mucous membranes of various organs. This can cause organs located in the respiratory tract to acquire increased susceptibility to PHMB and, in effect, a higher likelihood for the development of IPF. [10] Although the study did not match the exposure conditions of PHMB in humans, it has illuminated another way that individuals may develop IPF. [10]</p>\n<p>In a study investigating the role of DDAC\u2014one of the aerosols\u2014 in causing pulmonary fibrosis, mice exposed to DDAC exhibited fibrotic lesions that increased in severity over time. [11] Exposure to the chemical DDAC increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling and appeared to maintain the differentiation of myofibroblasts. [11] This was complemented by the high expression of genes responsible for the production of collagen in fibrogenic lungs. [11] Overall, the form of pulmonary fibrosis that was induced by DDAC was mild, and so more research must be conducted before it can be concluded that the chemical DDAC is responsible for irreversible, severe pulmonary fibrosis. [11] It is also possible that some of the patients affected with humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury may have experienced synergistic or additive effects from using multiple humidifier disinfectants, but this can be difficult to determine. [7] However, this study does indicate that exposure to DDAC can result in the development of several characteristics typically associated with IPF.</p>\n<p><h4>PHMG-P as a potential causative of IPF</h4>\nOf the chemicals listed in this literature review, PHMG-P has received the most attention by researchers. PHMG-P is a biocide that exhibits its antibacterial effect by disrupting the cell wall and inner membrane of bacteria, causing cellular leakage. [12] In a similar manner, PHMG-P can infiltrate the lungs in the form of aerosol particles and may cause IPF in individuals through the generation of ROS and the disruption of the ECM\u2019s alveolar basement membrane. [4]</p>\n<p>Disruption of the basement membrane occurs through increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that degrade various components of connective tissue matrices. [6] Metalloproteinase MMP2, in particular, destroys the basement membrane by solubilizing ECM elastin, fibronectin, and collagen, helping immune cells and fibroblasts migrate to alveolar spaces. [12] This can lead to severe damage of the lung architecture and aberrant ECM deposition typical of IPF. [4]</p>\n<p>In a study using an air-liquid interface (ALI) co-culture model to study the pathogenesis of fibrosis, PHMG-P was shown to trigger ROS generation, airway barrier injury, and inflammatory response. [4] Recall that exposure to other chemicals suspected of being potential inducers of IPF had similar effects. Therefore, it can be concluded that PHMG-P infiltrates the lungs in the form of aerosol particles and induces airway barrier injury by ROS. [4] This would result in the release of fibrotic inflammatory cytokines and trigger a wound-healing response that would eventually lead to pulmonary fibrosis. [4]</p>\n<p>In an animal study, mice exposed to PHMG-P experienced difficulty breathing and exhibited pathological lesions similar to the pathological features observed in humans affected with IPF. [12] A time course of 10 weeks was even established for PHMG-P-induced pulmonary fibrosis. [12] Throughout this period, it was found that a single instillation of PHMG-P contributed to an increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels and elicited an influx of inflammatory cells into lung tissue. [12] This recruitment of inflammatory cells contributes to the deposition of ECM components in the lungs and, as a result, the development of IPF. The instillation of PHMG-P was also suspected of blocking T cell development and impairing its function in the immune system. [6] This would result in an insufficient resolution of inflammation caused by the increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and result in stacked fibrotic changes and the progression of IPF. [6]</p>\n<p>Another study claimed that PHMG-P could cause pulmonary fibrosis through the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. [9] Recall that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is responsible for the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the development of IPF. According to the study, mice exposed to PHMG-P generated a large amount of ROS and produced significant levels of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner. [9] These cytokines produced by the NF- \u03baB signaling pathway are known to activate the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, increase collagen production, and promote wound-healing and tissue remodeling responses. [4] As these responses are characteristic of IPF and the cytokines exhibited in this study are known to be produced through the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, there is strong evidence that PHMG-P can induce IPF through the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.</p>\n<p><h4>The Mechanism of IPF</h4>\n<em>TGF-\u03b2\u2019s importance in the mechanism</em><br/>\nVarious studies of IPF have indicated that transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), one of the most significant fibrotic cytokines, plays a key role in the mechanism that induces IPF. TGF-\u03b21 is credited with inducing the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and upregulating the secretion of ECM proteins (like collagen) in IPF. [13]</p>\n<p>Specifically, growth factor TGF-\u03b21 binds directly to the TGF\u03b2 receptor II (TGF\u03b2RII), triggering the recruitment and activation of receptor TGF\u03b2RI by TGF\u03b2RII. [14] This step leads to the increased production of collagen through the activation of a collection of proteins called the Smad 2/3 complex. [13] The activated Smad 2/3 complex accomplishes this by entering the nucleus to enhance the transcription of profibrotic genes such as those that produce collagen. [13] This idea has been heavily supported by experimental evidence. Exposure to the chemical DDAC was found to increase cellular mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b21 by two-fold. [11] This increase contributed to the activation of the Smad 2/3 complex [11] and induced the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. [15] Overall, this led to the development of pulmonary fibrosis-causing fibrotic lesions in mice. [11]</p>\n<p>In another study, TGF-\u03b2 was found to promote the development of IPF by inhibiting the expression of the microRNA let-7d, driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased collagen deposition. [1] Typically, epithelial cells are important to maintaining lung functionality by acting as a barrier against pathogens and other harmful compounds and secreting protective substances. [4] During EMT, however, these cells increase in cellular motility [16] and are transformed into myofibroblasts, resulting in the acceleration of IPF. [4] Additionally, epithelial cells during EMT promote the recruitment of fibroblasts, while simultaneously inhibiting collagen degradation and elevating the levels of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). [4] TIMP-1 binds to metalloproteinase MMP2 to promote the growth of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, accelerating ECM deposition while preventing its degradation. [12] This corroborates the claim that the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway is a crucial component in the mechanism of IPF.</p>\n<p><em>MicroRNA\u2019s role in TGF-\u03b2 regulation and pulmonary fibrosis</em><br/>\nMicroRNAs are mRNA sequences that bind to complementary mRNA of proteins to prevent their translation and expression. They are also involved in multiple steps of fibrosis, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. [16] During the progression of IPF, miRNAs are known to regulate the process in which epithelial cells transition into myofibroblasts (EMT) to promote fibrosis. [16] Since each miRNA is specific to a particular mRNA sequence, miRNAs may function as either promoters or inhibitors of IPF. One study found that the miRNA, miR-433, can act as a promoter of IPF by upregulating receptor TGF\u03b2RI and growth factor TGF-\u03b21 to amplify TGF-\u03b2 signaling. [13] In a separate study, it was confirmed that miR-30c-1-3p may act as a negative regulator of pulmonary fibrosis through targeting the mRNA and preventing the expression of receptor TGF\u03b2RII. [15]</p>\n<p>In a study headed by the Department of Pathology at the University of Michigan Medical School, it was concluded that the development and pace of progression of IPF may be due to abnormal miRNA generation and processing. [1] It was found that in rapidly progressing IPF biopsies, five miRNAs significantly increased and one decreased when compared to slowly progressive biopsies. [1] This indicates that miRNAs have a significant influence on the mechanism of IPF. Additionally, members of the miR-30c and let-7d family significantly decreased in both forms of IPF when compared with unaffected individuals. [1] As stated previously, certain members of the miR-30c family are believed to be negative regulators of IPF and members of the let-7d family are inhibitors of EMT. All of the stated evidence signifies that miRNAs, in addition to the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, play important roles in the development of IPF.</p>\n<p><em>Other factors to consider in the mechanism</em><br/>\nThe NALP3 inflammasome is another important factor to consider in the mechanism of IPF. The NALP3 inflammasome is an innate immune system receptor suspected of being the main cause of persistent inflammatory response and exacerbation of fibrotic changes. [12] According to a study focused on researching PHMG-P-induced fibrosis in mice, the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome appeared to contribute to fibroblast proliferation and the progression of IPF due to the production of the cytokine IL-1\u03b2. [12] IL-1\u03b2 is known to increase the production of ROS needed to induce lung tissue damage by upregulating the expression of the cytokine chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1). [6] This upregulation of CXCL1 and resulting tissue damage was exhibited in the study, reinforcing the claim that the NALP3 inflammasome is a central component in the IPF mechanism. [12]</p>\n<p>Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), an antibody that has an important role in the immune system, also may have a role in the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis. In a study supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, immunoglobulin A, the most abundant human immunoglobulin, was compared with TGF-\u03b2 in its role in inducing pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. [3] In this study, sIgA enhanced collagen production and induced responses in cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). [3] MCP-1, similar to IL-6 and IL-8, is responsible for stimulating collagen synthesis and TGF-\u03b2 production in fibroblasts. [6] It was concluded that under IPF, sIgA may make contact with lung fibroblasts and result in exacerbating airway inflammation and fibrosis through enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines and ECM collagen. [3]</p>\n<p><h4>Potential therapeutic approaches and alternative methods of treatment</h4>\nAccording to recent studies, only two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been approved by the FDA for IPF treatment, and they have still failed to be significantly effective in treating the disease. [13] However, current studies on therapeutics that inhibit the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway appear promising. Two particular drugs of interest are oridonin and matrine, along with their derivatives.</p>\n<p>Oridonin, a major compound found in the herb Rabdosia rubescens, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammation and cancer for hundreds of years. [2] In a study focused on testing its effectiveness in treating IPF, it was found that exposure to oridonin significantly decreased the levels of three major biomarkers of fibrosis\u2014hydroxyproline (HYP), beta silicomolibdic acid (\u03b2-SMA), and collagen, type 1, alpha 1 (COL1A1)\u2014in a dose-dependent manner. [2] Additionally, oridonin attenuated pathological changes such as alveolar space collapse and infiltration of inflammatory cells. [2] Oridonin was able to achieve this through significantly inhibiting the upregulation of collagen production and the activation of Smad 2/3 in lung tissues, an important step in the progression of IPF through the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. [2] This presents a strong case for the use of oridonin as a treatment for IPF.</p>\n<p>Matrine, similar to oridonin, also has roots in traditional Chinese medicine. Matrine has been shown in several studies to exhibit significant antifibrotic effects through the inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway. In one study, matrine was shown to have an inhibitory effect against liver fibrosis by reducing the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and instead increasing the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). [13] Through the inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway, matrine was also shown to exhibit antifibrotic activities on cardiac fibrosis. [13] These antifibrotic effects are not just held by matrine, but their derivatives as well. The matrine derivative MASM was also shown to exhibit potent antifibrotic effects. [13] As the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway is a central component in the mechanism of IPF, matrine and their derivatives present themselves as strong candidates for anti-IPF therapeutics.</p>\n<p>Other drug candidates for the treatment of IPF are sesquiterpene lactones. Sesquiterpene lactones are naturally occurring compounds that are known to harbor extensive connections with the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway. [5] This makes these compounds and their analogues strong drug candidates for IPF treatment. In one study, two out of 44 semi-synthetic analogues of sesquiterpene lactones were found to highly inhibit the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway, ECM production, and the formation of fibroblasts. [5] This inhibition of ECM production and the formation of fibroblasts corroborates the claim that administering sesquiterpene lactones is an effective treatment for IPF.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, studies have shown microRNAs to be negative regulators of IPF. One study suggests that the replenishment of miR-30c may be a promising treatment. [15] Increased levels of miR-30c would promote the negative regulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, suppressing the differentiation of myofibroblasts and preventing excessive collagen accumulation. In this manner, the replenishment of miR-30c would attenuate IPF symptoms. The inhibition of certain miRNAs, such as miR-34a, has also been shown to be an effective treatment. The inhibition of miR-34a by treatment with the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (CSP) was found to prevent pulmonary fibrosis by preventing the overgrowth of fibroblasts. [17] Although the manipulation of miRNA expression has been shown to have a large impact on the development of IPF, there is one issue with this method of treatment. A single miRNA can target thousands of mRNAs, making the function miRNAs have in pathophysiological events involved in IPF unclear. [17]</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4>\nAlthough there is limited research on the etiology of IPF, this should only serve to motivate researchers to study its causes, mechanism, and potential treatments further. Thus far, the chemicals that have been shown to be potential inducers of IPF are PHMG-P, DDAC, PHMB, PGH, and the mixture of CMIT and MIT. However, out of all the chemicals, only PHMG-P has been heavily researched, and so additional studies are needed to confirm the other chemicals\u2019 involvement in inducing IPF. Additionally, this research could be expanded upon through the study of the effects of other household disinfectants on the human body to determine whether they are also factors in inducing IPF. Besides the discovery of potential causatives, studies have also further illuminated details about the mechanism. Specifically attracting interest is the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway in addition to miRNAs and their involvement in the regulation of IPF. Furthermore, the manipulation of TGF-\u03b2 and miRNA levels with oridonin, matirne, and sesquiterpene lactones has been linked to favorable outcomes in the treatment of IPF. With further research, these treatments could become common practice and improve the quality of life for patients suffering from IPF.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>S. R.

        "author": "By: Mari Hoffman, Genetics and Genomics 2021",
        "date": "05/02/2020",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n<p><h4>By  Mari Hoffman, Genetics and Genomics 2021</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4> In this paper, I will be discussing reviews on patient activation level and health outcomes in chronic diseases. I wanted to analyze the effect patients can have on their own treatment plans and discuss how they can make a difference. I feel personally connected to this topic because my dad was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has been a role model for me in his journey of his treatment plan.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patient involvement and education in their diagnosis is not a novel idea, but has been shown to play a role in overall patient experience [1, 2]. Chronic illnesses create responsibilities and demands on patients to manage and understand their care and diagnosis. It has been shown that chronic disease patients who take on a bigger role and engagement level with their own health have more positive outcomes [3]. Patient engagement or patient activation can be defined as \u201cthe individual\u2019s knowledge, skill, and confidence for managing their own health\u201d [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patients who are more involved in their diagnosis and treatment have been shown to have more positive outcomes. One study used survey data from cancer patients and assessed how patient activation level affected actions taken on by the patient, communication with the doctor, and overall satisfaction with their care and treatment [3]. The study used survey data that was collected by CancerCare who sent out six different online surveys to cancer patients in order to test their patient activation measure [3]. The survey was sent out to a sample that consisted of those who were 25 years or older and had received a cancer diagnosis [3]. The study population varied in different characteristics and after controlling for demographics and health status factors, the study found that patients who scored higher in their activation level were 4.7 times more likely to start exercise and 3.3 times more likely to start a healthier diet when compared to patients who scored less in their activation level [3]. The study also found that less activated patients had a lower score in following their doctor\u2019s recommendations, discussing side effects with their doctor, and in their overall satisfaction of their care received [3]. As discussed above, patients who scored higher on their activation level are more likely to be better informed on their treatment options and have greater proactivity in managing their condition [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a wide range of different factors that have been found to affect a patient\u2019s interest in participating in their health care decision-making. These factors are related to demographic, personal characteristics, ability to put time in, stage and severity of disease, and the influence from the practitioner [4]. There are many reasons not stated above why one may or may not involve themself in their own treatment decisions and plans.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Information about one\u2019s diagnosis and care treatment is one of the ways in which a patient can educate themself. This information enables people to understand and exchange with their healthcare provider on consequential decisions [4]. Education of the disease has been shown to increase the patient\u2019s willingness to ask questions because they are more confident in their understanding and therefore participate in a more active role in their treatment plan [4]. Decreasing the gap in education on their diagnosis also leads patients to better understand their own personal requirements with regard to their treatment and personalized treatment in terms of exercise and diet, and trust in their doctor to take their recommendations [4].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patient education and proactiveness can even lead to a patient becoming a driver in their own diagnosis. In January of 2016, my dad was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia by a general hematologist and was put on a \u201cwatch and wait\u201d approach. This approach essentially means that a patient\u2019s condition is monitored without receiving any treatment until there is a change in symptoms [5]. This made sense for my dad since his cancer was slow moving and he did not have many symptoms. Around six months later, the hematologist said he needed to be treated with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR), which is a Cytotoxic Chemotherapy. The doctor gave no real explanation for why he had to be treated at that time and regarding FCR, he simply said \u201cit\u2019s the gold standard.\u201d At this time, my dad had started to get connected with CLL support groups such as the CLL Society and decided to get a second opinion. Through the process of educating himself and receiving a second opinion, he realized there were many negative side effects that came with FCR that his doctor did not inform him about, and he would need his genetics tested to even see if he was compatible with the treatment. When he brought up his genetics to the doctor, the doctor responded saying he thought they already did that. My dad left the appointment feeling shocked and realizing he needed to be informed and educated on his treatment options if he wanted the best possible treatment. After doing genetic testing, he found over 50% of his cells were 17P deleted and he also had Trisomy 12. This meant his genetics would not be compatible with the treatment plan. It was becoming apparent to my dad that new non-cytotoxic treatments were superior for most CLL patients. He decided to take the initiative to continue to \u201cwatch and wait\u201d and explore other options.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After a couple of months, his symptoms started to progress and he got an appointment with a doctor at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) who told him that there was a clinical trial happening that could be a potential treatment option for his disease. Through his own research and the resources he found through the CLL Society website, support groups, and UCSD, he decided this was the right treatment for him. It was good that he chose to wait rather than take the initial treatment offered; if he chose the latter, he would have not qualified for the trial. He has been on the clinical trial with Venetoclax and Ibrutinib for about two years now and has shown normal numbers in terms of his white blood count, which is used to measure the presence of CLL. Through the resources provided to him, he was able to gain knowledge and connections with experts in the field to feel confident in his decision to find a treatment plan that worked for him. My dad is now very involved with the CLL Society and founded a local CLL support group in San Diego where they meet to discuss their experiences and bring in health professionals to lead discussions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My dad\u2019s personal story and the data shown above shows how imperative it is to do research and educate yourself on your own condition. It is critical to get your main information and opinions from your doctor, and to always consider a second opinion. Evidently, educating yourself on your own health and treatment plans can have beneficial effects overall, but it is critical to remember that doctors and health care professionals are trained in their field. It is very important to use your education and resources to find a specialist in your disease and start a conversation with them. Although you may not have all the resources in the beginning, the best advocate for your health and future is yourself. Use all the resources you can to continue to be informed and in touch with the professionals in the study of your disease.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thompson, Andrew G.h. \u201cThe Meaning of Patient Involvement and Participation in Health Care Consultations: A Taxonomy.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Social Science &amp; Medicine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 64, no. 6, 2007, pp. 1297\u20131310., doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.11.002.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hibbard, Judith H., and Jessica Greene. \u201cWhat The Evidence Shows About Patient Activation: Better Health Outcomes And Care Experiences; Fewer Data On Costs.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Health Affairs</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 32, no. 2, 2013, pp. 207\u2013214., doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1061.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hibbard, Judith H., et al. \u201cDoes Patient Activation Level Affect the Cancer Patient Journey?\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patient Education and Counseling</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 100, no. 7, 2017, pp. 1276\u20131279., doi:10.1016/j.pec.2017.03.019.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vahdat, Shaghayegh et al. \u201cPatient involvement in health care decision making: a review.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Iranian Red Crescent medical journal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> vol. 16,1 (2014): e12454. doi:10.5812/ircmj.12454</span></li>\n</ol>\n</div>",

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4> Adolescents are notorious for not getting enough sleep, but can that impact how the cells of our immune system operate? The following study reinforces the significance of maintaining a natural sleep schedule in adolescents and unveils a new area of research where sleep-wake patterns could be used as a diagnostic when screening for respiratory illnesses.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our circadian rhythm regulates a myriad of biological activity, ranging from metabolism and cell signaling pathways to various psychological and behavioral patterns. The circadian rhythm is defined as endogenous (built-in mechanism) and entrainable (adjusted to external stimuli such as temperature and light) [1]. Together, these factors manifest into a unique chronotype which describe an individual\u2019s propensity to sleep and wake at a particular time [2]. Recent studies have examined this biological pattern in relation to respiratory illness, revealing how </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">disruption in the circadian rhythm plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of airway inflammation and physiology. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The following study aims to further elucidate the relationship between an individual\u2019s chronotype and their susceptibility to asthma or allergic diseases, particularly in the adolescent population.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The study conducted by Halder et al. analyzed data from 1684 adolescents, ranging from ages 13-14, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">from the Prevalence and Risk Factors of Asthma and Allergy-Related Diseases among Adolescents (PERFORMANCE) study. Each individual was administered the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase III questionnaire to determine each adolescent\u2019s disp</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">osition to respiratory illness, with particular emphasis on wheeze, rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and asthma. This data was analyzed against responses from the reduced Morningness\u2013Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ), which was used to determine each participant\u2019s chronotype. An individual\u2019s chronotype was classified into one of three categories: morning, evening and intermediate types. Exte</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rnal factors such as demographics, social characteristics, and neighborhood environment (rural, industrial suburban, nonindustrial suburban and urban) were also considered as potential influences that may enhance asthma/allergy symptoms. Results revealed that an \u201cindividual\u2019s chronotype was associated with respiratory symptoms among adolescents\u201d. More specifically, those that were evening types, and intermediate types to a lesser extent, had a higher risk of current wheeze and current or ever rhinitis when compared to morning types. Intermediate types also demonstrated higher levels of Rhinoconjunctivitis when compared to morning types. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overall, individuals that were identified as evening types had a consistently higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms when compared to morning types.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Those identified as morning types did not exhibit significant correlation with respiratory symptoms. This association between respiratory symptoms and chronotype was paralleled, though to a lower degree, in individuals identified as intermediate types as well [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The wide pathophysiology of asthma and allergy makes it challenging to pinpoint a particular cellular process to explain this finding [4]. Previous studies have shown that asthma/allergy symptoms worsen at night which can be attributed to multiple immunological factors. A study by Christ et al. in 2018 observed the link between mast cell responsiveness, function in allergic diseases, and the circadian rhythm. Mast cells possess a high affinity for IgE antibody, which is produced by the immune system in response to allergen recognition. When activated by bound IgE, mast cells release chemokines, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators such as histamine, which exhibit diurnal character (are active during the daytime). This study illustrates how mast cell signaling, critically involved in the inflammatory response, operates on a circadian rhythm. This is due to the fact that inflammatory mediators are governed by diurnal (active during the day) behavior. [5]. This study focused on mast cell signaling by Christ et al. may provide some reasoning behind the results observed in the aforementioned study conducted by Halder et al. The Christ et al. study shows how dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle interferes with how the immune system responds to the presence of allergens, which could potentially aggravate the respiratory symptoms detailed in the Halder et al. study. For example, those identified as \u201cevening-types\u201d are \u201cmore easily prone to circadian misalignments that could eventually lead to circadian clock dysfunction which triggers several down-stream mechanisms including altered immune systems in the lungs\u201d.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Melatonin production is also a significant factor in the inflammatory immune response. Evening type individuals are exposed to higher levels of artificial light at night (ALAN) which disrupts daily rhythms and suppresses nocturnal melatonin production [6]. Melatonin, known as the sleep hormone, plays a vital role in immunomodulation. Immunomodulation is responsible for orchestrating the events of cellular and humoral immunity [7]. Recent studies have identified melatonin as a key player in asthma and allergy-related disease when the circadian rhythm is misregulated by abnormal sleep-wake patterns.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This study is the first to find an association between chronotype and respiratory symptoms in adolescents</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. As this is a cross-sectional study, researchers in this study are unable to make a causal statement that directly links sleeping patterns to respiratory illness. However, results from this study warrant further investigation into the cellular and behavioral effects of individuals who possess \u201cintermediate\u201d and \u201cevening type\u201d chronotypes. This finding uncovers a new outlet of healthcare, where an individual\u2019s unique chronotype is utilized as a tool in patient diagnosis for various metabolic, behavioral, and respiratory illnesses.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Circadian rhythm.

        "date": "02/19/2021",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s note</h4> As an undergraduate researcher at UC Davis, I have planned and executed a study in chemistry education and now am in the process of presenting findings. This experience sparked my interest in how students learn and what detriments there are to obtaining education. As a student, I was interested in learning what social isolation does to our brains and how it affects our education.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the current Covid-19 pandemic, the norm in terms of education has been virtual classes and recorded lectures. In the interest of safety, schools have closed lecture halls, minimized the number of students staying in a single dorm, and generally encouraged students to avoid contact with others. While these steps are all necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19, they also contribute to student loneliness, which severely hampers learning.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Why do we feel lonely right now?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When discussing social isolation today, we might find ourselves asking if we truly are \u201cisolated.\u201d Schools all across the country use Zoom to facilitate discussions and classes that would normally be in-person. Outside of the learning environment, many try to stay connected with friends and family via virtual meeting spaces to watch TV or play games together. However, being socially isolated isn\u2019t necessarily about the number of interactions, but rather the quality of interactions. Hawkley et al. state that \u201cPerceptions are critical \u2026 People can live rather solitary lives and not feel lonely, or they can have many social relationships and nevertheless feel lonely\u201d [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is coupled with the fact that historically, college students have been more prone to feelings of loneliness compared to the general populace. Diehl et al. were some of the first to study loneliness in college with an emphasis on transition-related causes, such as moving out for the first time or the formation of new relationships, and concluded that transitions naturally led to loneliness [2]. And indeed, the transition from in-person learning to online learning has been documented to have caused loneliness as well. Killgore et al. studied over 3,000 adults in the first three months of the Covid-19 pandemic [3].\u00a0 The loneliness scores were calculated via a set of online questionnaires including the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Interestingly, even when communities started to reopen and participants noted that their \u201csheltering-in-place\u201d was decreasing, their loneliness scores increased significantly from April to May 2020 and eventually plateaued in June, which was attributed to participants adjusting to their situations [3]. Diehl et al. speculated that \u201c[refraining] from handshakes, hugs, and pats on the back,\u201d long-held social behaviors to express closeness \u201chave been radically altered,\u201d leading to the continuation of loneliness even as we re-enter communities [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indeed, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">physical touch has been shown to have an important link to loneliness, and even those who are socializing with others, or wouldn\u2019t categorize themselves as lonely, still suffer if they are not touching others.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> In a study conducted in May 2020, Tejada et al. tested people to see if human touch would affect their feelings of loneliness despite belonging to a culture described as \u201cindividualistic\u201d [4]. Tejada et al. explained that individualistic cultures, such as Anglo-Saxon societies, stress independence and neglect physical contact. They found that participants\u2019 loneliness scores generally decreased when they were given a small oil rub by researchers [4]. They calculated the scores using heart rate, questionnaires, and an emotional recognition test [4]. The study essentially proves that even individuals who may view a lack of touch as normal, or those who normally have limited social interaction with others, still feel lonely without direct human contact.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Cognitive decay linked to loneliness</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now that we have established that social isolation leads to a general increase in loneliness, it is important to illustrate the link between loneliness and cognitive decay, which is negatively impacting students\u2019 ability to learn. Cacioppo and Hawkley documented that, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in addition to physical health problems such as increased blood pressure, increased levels of stress, and a decrease in physical activity, loneliness also contributes to various mental problems, such as a decrease in IQ and an increase in the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [5]. While Cacioppo noted that these mental problems were mostly observed in the elderly, there was evidence to suggest that loneliness early on would lead to changes in IQ levels over a lifetime. In young adults specifically, Cacioppo. et al. witnessed in a separate study that lonelier people tend to get more distracted and have a harder time focusing compared to people who did not feel lonely, indicating the lonelier people may have experienced cognitive decay [6].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So how are we supposed to avoid this cognitive and physical decay? According to Dr. Maggie Mulqueen in a PBS interview, we should practice social distancing, but make a more conscious effort to reach out to people and avoid social isolation. \u201cWe need to respect social distancing and hand-washing as our best means right now to save ourselves physically. But we need to really shore people up against social isolation,\u201d she said [7]. Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious diseases and vice chairman of the department of medicine at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, Massachusetts, acknowledged the need for touching one another, and encouraged people to plan demonstrations of affection, even something as simple as a hug, in advance [8]. While it is important to minimize the spread of Covid-19, it is also important to maintain our own mental wellbeing and avoid isolating ourselves socially.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Citations</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hawkley, et al. \u201cFrom Social Structural Factors to Perceptions of Relationship Quality and Loneliness: The Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study.\u201d November 2008.
