        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>Biostatisticians led by Knut Wittkowski at Rockefeller University Hospital have employed new methods of genome-wide association studies to identify genes that they believe to be associated with autism. The researchers compared genomes of patients with varying degrees of autism to healthy patients and were able to identify genetic variations that seem to be linked to the pathology of neural development in young children. The technique used to identify these genes is unique. Rather than traditional genome association, which searches for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), this new method looks for combinations of several SNPs that are common in patients with a disease. Wittkowski also compared this new autism profile to patients with childhood epilepsy and found mutations in similar genes that control axonal guidance and calcium signaling. Both of these are important in the developing brain to ensure that the correct connections are made.<span id=\"more-102\"></span></p>\n<p>If these results are confirmed with clinical studies, this could allow for earlier treatment. Specifically, researchers at Rockefeller believe that due to the genetic similarities between autism and epilepsy, pharmaceutical interventions normally used for epilepsy could be successfully used to treat or prevent the onset of autism. These drugs would need to be employed between 9 and 24 months, as this is when the neural degradation that solidifies autism is active. In a broader sense, this type of statistical study could be used to understand a multitude of diseases, and has the potential to change the way that we treat diseases that turn out to be genetically similar.</p>\n<p>Read the paper:</p>\n<p>K M Wittkowski, V Sonakya, B Bigio, M K Tonn, F Shic, M Ascano, C Nasca, G Gold-Von Simson.\u00a0<h4>A novel computational biostatistics approach implies impaired dephosphorylation of growth factor receptors as associated with severity of autism</h4>.\u00a0<i>Translational Psychiatry</i>, 2014; 4 (1): e354 DOI:10.1038/tp.2013.124</p>\n</div>"

However, research over the past couple of decades has shown that risk for CVD and type II diabetes could begin as early as prenatally through adverse exposures, such as overnutrition and placental insufficiency. Some mechanisms involved in determining risk for CVD and Type II diabetes are oxidative stress, inflammation, lipotoxicity, and epigenetics. <span id=\"more-113\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_111\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a data-caption=\"Diagram of maternal obesity and over nutritionFrom \u201cMaternal Diet-Induced Obesity and Offspring Cardiovascular Health.\u201dJournal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease\" href=\"http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-19-at-4-13-35-pm.png\"><img alt='Diagram of maternal obesity and over nutrition From \"Maternal Diet-Induced Obesity and Offspring Cardiovascular Health.\"  Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease  ' aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-111\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-111\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2014/02/screen-shot-2014-02-19-at-4-13-35-pm.png?w=240\" width=\"240\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-111\">Diagram of maternal obesity and over nutrition<br/>From \u201cMaternal Diet-Induced Obesity and Offspring Cardiovascular Health.\u201d<br/>Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease</p></div>\n<p>Oxidative stress is associated with increased production of oxidizing species or a decrease in the effectiveness of antioxidant defenses. Inflammation is associated with elevated C-Reactive protein levels. Lipotoxicity is associated with an imbalance of the amount of lipids produced and the amount that is used. Epigenetics is represented by modifications in gene expression and epigenetics plays a key-role in understanding how the environment and genes interact with one another. One important gene modification associated with CVD and type II diabetes is DNA methylation.</p>\n<p>One study that links oxidative stress and higher risk for CVD and/or type II diabetes was with sheep hearts. This study showed that hearts of obese pregnant sheep, that consumed a high-fat diet, showed oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress was also shown to be present in the hearts of the offspring of the obese sheep that ate a high-fat diet during pregnancy. Studies in sheep have shown that elevated levels of oxidative stress in the heart along with activation of p38, JNK, and AMPK in offspring correspond with maternal obesity. P38 and JNK are mitogen\u2013activated protein kinases in the heart that are activated by numerous pathologic stresses, including oxidative stress. Activation of p38 in human hearts has been linked with advance heart failure. JNK activation diminishes mitochondrial gene expression involved in oxidative phosphorylation chain reaction and fatty acid metabolism, which both have a major impact on the energetic status of the heart. A lower energetic status is associated with an increased risk for CVD. AMPK is a AMP-activated protein kinase. It is activated in response to alterations in cellular energy levels. Metabolic activators of AMPK include oxidative stress and glucose deprivation. The activation of AMPK results in fatty acid oxidation, acceleration of glycolysis, promotion of glucose transport, and inhibition of protein synthesis and triglycerides. Activation of AMPK has been linked to an increase risk for CVD and type II diabetes.</p>\n<p>Another study that showed oxidative damage definitely played a role in the development of CVD and type II diabetes was with mice. Pregnant mice were fed a high-fat diet, but some were also administered antioxidants. In the offspring whose mothers were fed antioxidants, hypertension was prevented from developing and blood glucose levels were normal. By preventing the development of CVD and type II diabetes, this shows that oxidative stress caused by maternal diet definitely plays a role in their development.</p>\n<p>In human placentas of obese pregnancies there were signs of inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are both associated with having negative impacts on fetal growth. Inflammation during pregnancy has been linked to a decrease in the intrinsic ability of the heart to contract. In a study with female mice, one group of mice had a high-fat diet during pregnancy, lactation, and postnatally and another group ate a high-fat diet only postnatally. Both groups showed elevated levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP). However, the only offspring with elevated levels of CRP were in the group where the mothers consumed a high-fat diet during pregnancy. CRP is a protein that is found in the blood, and CRP levels rise in response to inflammation. Elevated levels of CRP are associated with an increase risk of CVD and type II diabetes.</p>\n<p>Lipotoxicity has been associated in offspring whose mothers consumed a high-fat diet during pregnancy. Lipotoxicity is a metabolic syndrome that results in accumulation of lipid intermediates in non-adipose tissues, like heart tissue, which can lead to cellular dysfunction and death. Lipotoxicity in the heart is associated with excess saturated fatty acids. In a study with mice where mouse offspring were exposed to a maternal high-fat diet prenatally and postnatally, during lactation, the offspring had lipid accumulation within the heart indicating Lipotoxicity. Lipotoxicity is associated with development of CVD and type II diabetes.</p>\n<p>DNA methylation can silence the expression of specific genes This is done through transcriptional repression, which is caused by blocking the binding of transcription factors. This is done by altering recognition sites for transcription factors and/or promoting the binding of the methyl CpG binding protein-2. This results in the reduction of accessibility of DNA for transcription, which results in a lower expression of the proteins encoded by that DNA. Many times methylation patterns are established prenatally or in early developmental stages due to the fact that DNA methylation plays a key role in cell differentiation. Silencing the expression of particular genes during development allows for cell differentiation.</p>\n<p>In a study where different rats were fed a different amount of protein during pregnancy, it was found that the rats that were fed a low protein diet during pregnancy had offspring with high blood pressure, which is common in people who develop CVD and/or type II diabetes. It was also found that the offspring had insulin resistance, which is associated with diabetes. Decreasing protein in the maternal diet led to hypomethylation of the PPARa and GR promoter. PPARa is a transcription factor and major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver. The GR is expressed in most cells in the body and regulates most genes that control development, metabolism, and immune response. This suggests that epigenetic change can modify the activity associated with metabolic pathways, which then can lead to the development of CVD and/or Type II diabetes.</p>\n<p>There is consistent evidence that adverse exposures prenatally can lead to the development of CVD and type II diabetes later in life. Many studies show that overnutrition and placental insufficiency are the main prenatal causes of the development of these diseases. Further studies still need to be done to confirm these findings, but so far the evidence is promising. It is important that those expecting are aware of their nutritional intake for not only their own sake, but for their child\u2019s sake as well. A well balanced diet and moderate exercise are some the most important factors in having a healthy pregnancy and baby.</p>\n<p>Works Cited</p>\n<p>Blackmore, H.

In the modern era, numerous athletes participate in blood doping by injecting erythropoietin (EPO) into their blood to increase the amount of red blood cells and thus improve their athletic performance. EPO is a protein hormone produced by the kidney which stimulates the production of red blood cells when released into the bloodstream. Increased red blood production increases the amount of oxygen available in the body and boosts an athlete\u2019s performance. Yannis Pitsiladis, a psychologist in Scotland, is at the forefront of developing anti-doping testing based on the genetic fingerprint left by drugs. Conventionally researches developed tests to find the drug, but Pitsiladis has taken another approach. He is developing a new generation of tests that will gather evidence from the doper\u2019s own body.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-171\"></span>Pitsiladis hypothesized that RNA should reflect changes if the body has been fooled into making more blood cells. To test his theory, he drew blood from runners in Scotland and Kenya, injected them with EPO and recorded unique fluctuations in RNA sequences several times a month. This resulted in a dramatic discovery: more than 100 RNA sequences in the doped blood had unique fluctuations. The body responds to EPO by moderating the expression of certain genes\u2013certain RNA fragments were 16 times more plentiful in the doped blood. \u00a0Doped blood (even doping with one\u2019s own blood) has an unusual amount of specific proteins as a result of freezer burn which develops as blood ages; thus doped blood can be differentiated from regular blood. \u00a0Because this test utilizes secondhand evidence of protein patterns and RNA levels (rather than the direct evidence of presence of drugs), researchers have a lot of work to do in distinguishing between natural and artificial processes in the body. Although this new method of testing is promising, we\u2019ll have to wait until the next Olympics for this test to be ready.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reference:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cornwall, Warren.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>The genomes of male and female mammals differ by one chromosome. The Y chromosome is only present in males, and is responsible for initiating the physiological and morphological differences between the sexes. This has not always been the case though; at one point, the X and Y were identical, and over time the Y chromosome began to differentiate from the X chromosome and shrink in size. The Y chromosome today only has 20 genes, whereas the X chromosome has over 1,000 genes.<span id=\"more-223\"></span></p>\n<p>Until recently it was unknown when the Y chromosome originated. The team of Henrik Kaessmann, Associate Professor at the CIG and group leader at Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, have found that the first \u201csex genes\u201d originated 175 million years ago in mammals. These scientists have discovered this by studying samples of several male tissues, in particular male gonads, from different species in the three major mammalian lineages, placentals, marsupials, and monotremes (egg laying mammals).</p>\n<p>The scientists compared genetic sequences from male and female tissues.To avoid analyzing the whole genome, they then eliminated all sequences that both sexes had in common, which allowed the scientists to focus on only male-specific genes. After almost 30,000 hours of computing, they found that the common ancestor of the placentals and marsupials had the same sex-determining gene, named SRY, which emerged 180 million years ago. In monotremes another gene, AMHY, is responsible for the development of Y chromosomes and this gene appeared 175 million years ago. The development of the Y chromosome was essential for mammalian evolution, which is why knowing these time scales is so important. Now the question is: what determined sex before the Y chromosome evolved? Some think that it may have been environmental factors that determined sex, but as of now no one truly knows.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_224\" style=\"width: 168px\"><a data-caption=\"Human Chromosom YSource : http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome=YNLM Copyright InformationGovernment information at NLM Web sites is in the public domain.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>Viral evolution is an emerging field in biology that has great implications for human health. T7 is a phage virus, meaning it infects bacteria, and is a powerful model system in evolutionary virology. In a recent experiment, a team of biologists sought to understand the degree to which genetic elements engineered into the T7 phage genome affected the phage\u2019s rate of propagation. In this context, the genetic elements are sequences of DNA that are inserted between genes that allow for researchers to manipulate gene regulatory networks. This allows biologists to probe how phenotypes change when gene-gene interactions are perturbed. \u00a0Previous studies had shown that such genomic elements led to decreased fitness for the virus, but these investigators hoped to better understand how exactly such a system would evolve in laboratory conditions.</p>\n<p>To address their questions, the scientists grew both T7 viruses with and without design elements in each of two conditions. One condition was in a nutritious broth that used one intestinal bacterium as a host, and the other in a glucose sugar medium that had a different host bacterium. Both T7 strains were allowed to grow for 700-1000 generations in the glucose media and 100 generations in the broth media. Limitless bacteria were provided for the phages in order to encourage growth, and the researchers hypothesized that their experiment would allow enough time for the maladapted viruses to slough off deleterious design elements through evolutionary adaptation.<span id=\"more-243\"></span></p>\n<p>A growth rate assay of both T7 strains before and after the experiment added insight into the changes in fitness of the evolved populations. The results of the assay showed that the fitness levels of the engineered T7 strains were much closer to the wild-type strains after the experiment than before, indicating successful adaptation. They also compared the genomes of the strains before and after the experiment to pinpoint where evolution had occurred.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that the broth-reared viruses retained 45 of 65 design elements while the glucose-reared populations kept 40 of the 60 elements. Curiously enough, there were regions in the wild-type T7 that were also lost in the engineered T7 over evolutionary time. Furthermore, one such region contained approximately nine of the design elements in the engineered genome, suggesting that the evolutionary conditions favored the deletion of that region irrespective of design elements. The results also showed that the wild-type T7 strain raised in the glucose medium exhibited a greater degree of molecular evolution (as measured by DNA sequence changes) than the engineered strains. The researchers did raise the point, however, that the genetic differences between the wild-type and engineered strains could be a result of the design elements altering the type of sequence changes that are beneficial, rather than causing primary fitness effects. Of primary interest was that, due to a lack of gene addition or deletion, the engineered elements reduced fitness by altering gene regulation rather than gene number.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Springman R, Molineux IJ, Duong C, Bull RJ, and Bull JJ. 2012.

At the molecular scale, the biological turnover of such key elements as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron and sulfur depends on the enzymatic transfer of electrons from reduced (electron-donating) to oxidized (electron-accepting) forms of these elements. On the global scale and over geological time, reduced substrates and oxidized products map to a vast, often circuitous flux between the interior depths of the mantle and the oceans, land, and atmosphere.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-325\"></span></p>\n<p>At the heart of this \u2018global metabolic pathway\u2019 lie the genes encoding the electron-shuttling oxidation-reduction (redox) machinery buried in cell membranes. Despite the planet\u2019s turbulent history, with mass extinctions brought on by asteroid impacts, glaciation, and other dramatic environmental changes, these core metabolic genes for redox chemistry\u2014and, by extension, the major biogeochemical cycles\u2014have been remarkably conserved. This is likely due to the sheer ubiquity of microbial cells in nearly every conceivable environmental niche, as well as their ability to readily swap genes. Viruses, however, typically outnumber host cells in the environment by more than 10:1 and therefore can exert top-down influence over the global metabolic pathway.</p>\n<p>Beyond directly controlling population abundance through cell lysis, viruses influence genetic expression in microbial populations by transiently or stably transferring functional genes to and from their hosts. This can occur when parts of a host genome are occasionally packaged into viral particles during infection. In these relatively rare events, the viruses act as temporary carriers of foreign DNA. But viruses also have the capacity to integrate this new DNA into their own genomes, thus serving as stable reservoirs of genetic material for metabolic reprogramming of certain microbial populations.</p>\n<p>In one well-known example, cyanobacterial phages (viruses that infect bacteria) in the open oceans were found to contain bacterially-derived genes for photosynthesis, which temporarily improve host fitness in order to ensure sufficient resources for viral replication. So far, comparatively little has been known about virus-host interactions at depths beyond the reach of direct sunlight, despite the fact that these regions comprise by far the greatest volume occupied by the biosphere. However, a recent metagenomic analysis of seafloor hydrothermal vent samples suggests a role for viral regulation over a part of the sulfur cycle through the transfer of auxiliary sulfur oxidation genes to infected bacteria.</p>\n<p>A University of Michigan-based team sequenced samples from five Pacific Ocean sites, revealing the presence of genomes from viruses believed to infect an uncultured group of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria known as SUP05. These marine organisms are lithotrophs, feeding off of reduced sulfur species and hydrogen for energy, and occur throughout the deep ocean. Fifteen of eighteen total phage genomes recovered in the analysis contained SUP05-derived genes for sulfite reductase, an enzyme complex needed for elemental sulfur oxidation, as well as several other redox-associated genes. These sulfur oxidation genes don\u2019t appear to be recent hitchhikers in the viral genomes\u2014rather, the sequencing evidence indicates that they have been retained by selection for their ability to supplement their hosts\u2019 sulfur metabolism during infection.</p>\n<p>Elemental sulfur is a key metabolic intermediate generated by SUP05 bacteria in the course of sulfide oxidation. A bioenergetic model created by the researchers predicted that aerobic oxidation of elemental sulfur, detected at high levels at the sampled sites, could account for up to 93% of the available lithotrophic energy there, providing a strong selective pressure for the retention of sulfur oxidation genes in the SUP05-infecting phage. Already, the data indicate that these dynamics likely play out beyond vent systems localized to seafloor-spreading centers. For example, a broader analysis of viral genomes in the open dark ocean revealed the presence of the same sulfur oxidation genes found at the sampled vent sites.</p>\n<p>Since the inclusion of host-derived genes in viral genomes might be expected in any environment where a growth advantage for the infected host is essential for viral fitness, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising if increased environmental sampling and sequence analysis reveals similar cases for other environmentally important redox reactions. Such findings may further highlight the unique ecological role of certain viruses in modulating the global metabolic pathway and the biogeochemical cycles it supports.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Falkowski, P.G., Fenchel, T., Delong, E.F.

        "date": "02/10/2015",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>By Rayan Kaakati, Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior</p>\n<p>Being born female automatically enters one in a game of Russian roulette: About 1 in 8 women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of their lifetime; for American women, breast cancer is the second leading cause of death (U.S. Breast Cancer Statistics).</p>\n<p>Breast cancer is a disease that starts in the tissues of the breast and is statistically fatal for one in thirty-two women (Breast Cancer Facts). Many women, throughout recorded history, have succumbed to this malignant disease. Rapid advancements in research have been very promising for cancer cell-targeting medications and for gene modification techniques.</p>\n<p>Medicine in the twenty-first century is still resorting to what the ancient Chinese and Arab doctors used to practice: \u201cIf cancerous, cut it out if possible,\u201d or in current-day terms, order a \u201clumpectomy\u201d or a \u201cmastectomy\u201d (if the entire breast is to be removed). In recent years, a toxic chemo \u201csmoothie\u201d and an intensive radiation regimen have been added, coupled with hormone therapy.\u00a0 While these medical procedures are credited with saving thousands of lives, they are still primitive compared to current, promising research works.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-399\"></span></p>\n<p>Around 5-10% of breast cancers arise from inherited gene mutations. Examples of mutated genes that increase one\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer are the BRCA genes. These genes normally produce tumor-suppressing proteins to repair damaged DNA, thus preventing tumor formation. When BRCA genes are mutated, DNA damage accumulates, which increases a woman\u2019s risk of developing the disease. Women with a BRCA1 mutation have a 55-65% risk of developing breast cancer while this risk is 45% in women with a BRCA2 mutation (BRCA1 &amp; BRCA2: Cancer Risk &amp; Genetic Testing). The statistic that around 5-10% of breast cancers arise from inherited gene mutations could be misleading however, as around 85% of breast cancers develop in females who have no family members with the disease (U.S. Breast Cancer Statistics). Nonetheless, the cause of the disease is still due to genetic mutations. These women have spontaneous mutations that have arisen due to the aging process\u2014and other known and unknown causes\u2014 and thus have accumulated a number of mutations over time (Privalsky).</p>\n<p>Recently, stories have emerged on Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u201cprophylactic\u201d or risk-reducing surgery (double mastectomy) performed after she was screened and found to have inherited the defective BRCA genes from her mother, who died from breast cancer. Jolie has been a positive influence on many women, as there has been an increase in the number of women screened for the defective BRCA genes (Privalsky). Another preventative measure for those who have tested positive in a BRCA mutation involves removing a woman\u2019s ovaries, in order to reduce the amount of estrogen circulating in the body. However, less invasive measures are needed, as many women with increased heredity risks are making the difficult decision of undergoing a mastectomy or an oophorectomy to prevent the disease.</p>\n<p>With the appropriate amount of funding, a radical, new technique called \u201camino acid replacement therapy\u201d to repair and genetically alter the BRCA genes could prove successful. The basic idea behind the treatment is to alter the amino acid sequence or \u201cgenetic code\u201d of the defective gene to restore the correct functional version. Thus, this replacement therapy could eliminate the hereditary risk associated with the defective BRCA genes and prevent the prophylactic removal of organs.</p>\n<p>Another gene implicated in cancer is not a mutated gene; rather it\u2019s an over-expressed gene, known as HER-2. This gene stimulates cell proliferation and, when over-expressed, increases the risk of developing breast cancer. Much research has focused on targeting and silencing this gene, as it has been found that the level of HER-2 gene is over-expressed in 15-20% of patients with breast cancer (Breast Cancer).\u00a0 Researchers are looking for ways to synthesize drugs that target and silence these genes and prevent them from over-expressing before the disease develops. Such research is already underway, as an antibody called \u201cherceptin\u201d has been synthesized to target and silence the over-produced protein made from HER-2 (Privalsky).</p>\n<p>Gene silencing, another exciting approach to prevent mastectomies and lumpectomies, is being developed at Harvard University. This research involves injections of RNA interference particles (RNAi) into the breasts of mice to turn off the \u201cHoxA1\u201d gene, which has been labeled as an oncogenic gene (Ferber). Their results so far have shown that as few as 25% of the mice injected with the RNAi develop cancer, as opposed to 100% of the control mice, all of which developed breast cancer (Ferber). This procedure is still far from human trials, and further funding is needed, but it shows promise.</p>\n<p>In the words of Don Ingber, M.D., Ph.D, of the Wyss Institute of Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard, \u201cThe idea would be start giving it early on and sustain treatment throughout life to prevent cancer development or progression\u201d (quoted in Ferber). The availability of effective sustained treatments would give men and especially women a peaceful state of mind, especially if they have an increased hereditary risk of developing the disease.</p>\n<p>Such new, exciting treatments could prevent the need for surgical, prophylactic removal of organs and could minimize \u201cchemoprevention.\u201d Some doctors recommend chemoprevention to prevent breast cancer, especially for women with an increased hereditary risk. Chemoprevention is the administration of vitamins, Tamoxifen, aspirin, or other substances to reduce the risk of developing the disease (chemoprevention). Many of these drugs have chronic side effects. Tamoxifen, for example, blocks estrogen receptors, thus reducing the activity of estrogen (\u201cthe bone protecting hormone\u201d). As a result, many women on Tamoxifen have a low bone density and must take calcium supplements to relieve their symptoms of osteoporosis.</p>\n<p>Breast cancer and cancer research in general is on the verge of making a quantum leap forward, as researchers are looking for ways to alter the defective gene prior to it waking up from its slumber, or by developing a medication that will target the diseased cell\u2019s distinctive amino acid sequence, thereby eliminating only the diseased cells.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">References:</span></p>\n<p>\u201cBRCA1 &amp; BRCA2: Cancer Risk &amp; Genetic Testing.\u201d <em>National Cancer Institute</em>.

I was amazed at the advancements of medical technology which allow us to understand diseases and create potential cures, previously never thought possible. My purpose for writing this review is to show scientific audiences the most current research on how bacteria in the respiratory microbiome has an impact on asthma. Recently, much research initiated by the Human Microbiome Projects (HMP) proved that the bacteria living on and inside humans contribute to the health and disease of the body. This review is meant to educate scientists on the most recent information on development of childhood asthma and prompt others to conduct future research on preventative treatments for the disease.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-722\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">An uncontrollable coughing and heavy wheezing fit may seem all too familiar to those with severe asthma. Childhood asthma impacts millions of children and their families, and the majority of children who develop asthma do so before the age of five (aaaai.org). The US Department of Health and Human Services defines asthma as an inflammatory disease of the airways with generally reversible airflow obstruction and increased sensitivity of the throat muscles (Earl). \u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Asthma symptoms include: breathing problems, intense coughing or wheezing, and chronic respiratory infections</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> (Earl).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Lung tissue inflammation, due to environmental, immunological, or genetic factors, can be the cause of serious asthma (aaaai.org). However, recent studies have identified another serious cause of asthma: \u201cthe bacteria living in the nasal passages, throat, and lungs.\u201d Bacteria living in a certain area of the body is referred to as a microbiota, and its composition at each location on body is distinct (Versalovic). For example, the bacteria that live in the throat and lungs, comprising the respiratory microbiota, cannot thrive nor live in the kidneys or skin. Harmful bacteria may get trapped in the respiratory microbiota and cause an inflammatory response of the cell tissues and muscles in the throat and lungs (Versalovic). A better understanding of the disease has been reached due to new medical insights that have linked respiratory microbiota during infancy to the development of severe childhood asthma and chronic breathing problems later on in life (Teo).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The formation of a microbiota occurs during an infant\u2019s first year of life, similar to how an immune system develops. The immediate surroundings have a large impact on the baby because both the good and bad bacteria will essentially colonize inside and outside the body. It is common for many infants to get sick or develop respiratory infections, often from harmful microbes, or tiny bacteria, that get trapped in the part of the throat that connects to the nose (Teo). Infections during infancy that spread from the throat to lower respiratory airways and lungs can lead to development of asthma later on in life (Teo). Problems such as bacterial respiratory tract infections during infancy have a strong association with worsening or increased severity of symptoms in children with asthma (Earl). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Now scientists are realizing asthma can be caused by the bacteria living in your throat. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Childhood Asthma Study (CAS), an investigation of the respiratory microbiome during the first year of life for a cohort of 234 children, correlated bacteria and asthma development. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The trial came to this conclusion by tracking infants with both respiratory infections and breathing problems and looking at their throat bacteria collected from a cotton swab (Teo). \u00a0Results showed different types of bacteria living in a healthy throat versus a sick asthma throat (ibid). The majority of all the affected children contained a harmful throat bacteria called Streptococcus (ibid). In addition, the majority of all the healthy children contained a beneficial throat bacteria called Moraxella, which was significantly absent in the sick throats (ibid). Based on this trial, Moraxella may play a protective role in the throat, and if absent, can lead to negative impacts and colonization of \u00a0harmful bacteria like Streptococcus (ibid). The harmful Strep bacteria indicates a strong asthma predictor because those infants developed mild to severe breathing problems within the next 6 months (ibid). Thus, the types of bacteria living in the respiratory microbiota can contribute to the nature of infections and inflammatory responses \u00a0seen in asthma (Earl). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Human Microbiome Project (HMP), initiated in 2008, caused a surge in research about how the tiny organisms living on and inside humans can affect the body in health and disease, such as throat bacteria and its impact on asthma. Funding of this project advanced technology in order to detect and code bacterial DNA, known as genetic sequencing. In a recent pediatric asthma study, the effects of the respiratory microbiota on asthma was determined by genetically sequencing bacteria in both healthy and sick airways, and then comparing the DNA (Versalovic). Broad results showed the bacteria in asthma airways differed from bacteria in healthy airways (ibid). However, upon further investigation of the bacteria by comparing their DNA through genetic sequencing, it was determined that the harmful and beneficial bacteria were very closely related (ibid). This result signifies that such minute differences in DNA can have such a large impact on how the bacteria contributes to the respiratory microbiota, whether it be positive or negative. The results of this study indicate future research on possible asthma treatments is needed to determine how to carefully isolate harmful bacteria from the throat, without disturbing the closely related beneficial bacteria (ibid). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Asthma was previously understood as a disease due to genetic or environmental factors, however now scientists realize that it is caused by the bacteria living in your throat. The new research and biology behind the development of the disease will allow scientists to properly understand childhood asthma. The unique approach of changing or isolating the bacteria living in the respiratory microbiota as a treatment plan may impact numerous children and their families dealing with the asthma disease.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Works Cited</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cAsthma Overview.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> AAAAI, 2015.

This assignment was inspired by the seminar\u2019s focus on religious controversies surrounding scientific advancements, theories, and concepts. Another main reason why we wrote this piece is because of our backgrounds. Parnya, a computer engineer major, and myself, a biology major, both attended Catholic high schools. We enjoyed writing this piece because analyzing science and technology in the face of religious teachings and practice is something we will have to consider in our future careers. We chose to analyze abortion because it is one of the most popular and controversial science vs religion topics today. After reading this piece, we would like our readers to understand that while science can heal and cure, it can also offend and upset religious groups. As college students studying science, it is our job to develop our own opinions, while respecting those whose beliefs differ from our own.\u201d</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-723\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Throughout history, stem cells have become one of the most intriguing scientific discoveries because of their ability to save lives and to improve the health industry. They were first discovered in 1961, when </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Drs. James Till, a biophysicist, and Ernest McCulloch, a hematologist, published accidental findings in \u201cRadiation Research\u201d that proved the existence of stem cells (Stem Cell History). Stem cells are a promising scientific discovery and can be used to help improve many health conditions, including spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, lung diseases, and arthritis (Lyon). They are also unique in that they are unlike any other cell in the body. Stem cells are described as unspecialized cells that can renew themselves through cell division and under certain experimental conditions, they can be induced to become tissue or organ specific cells with special functions (Stem Cell Information). There is no doubt that stem cells are useful in improving medicine and health. However, they have also shown to cause controversy, especially amongst religious groups, who question the ethics behind stem cell use. Because stem cells can be taken from any tissue in the body, as well as a human embryo, stem cell use has been both favored and disfavored by a variety of religious groups who have different beliefs regarding the value of a human embryo. It is important to understand these different religious views because scientific research often creates broader implications beyond its improvement of one\u2019s health. Therefore, when making scientific decisions regarding disease treatment and management, scientists and health professionals should also consider and evaluate their decisions in a wider context outside the medical field.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">It is important to understand both what makes stem cells unique and their significance in scientific research in order to assess their impact on both the scientific and religious communities. \u00a0The two main types of stem cells are embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells, or stoma cells. While the adult stem cells reside in a \u201cstem cell niche,\u201d or a specific area of each tissue, the embryonic stem cells are found in the preimplantation stage of an embryo, the stage in which the embryo has not yet implanted in the wall of the uterus (Stem Cell Information). At this point, fertilization has already occurred and the embryo is undergoing multiple stages of development. In fact, the embryonic stem cells are specifically extracted from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, which is a fertilized egg four days after conception (Reaves). The embryos used in stem cell research are fertilized in a special way; the</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> embryos used for research are fertilized in vitro, or outside the woman\u2019s body, and are donated for research purposes with the consent of the donor (Stem Cell History). Therefore, the donor theoretically has knowledge of how the embryo will be used and has agreed to the use of the embryo for the improvement of scientific research. Furthermore, </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">scientists have learned that these embryonic stem cells are also pluripotent; they have the capability to differentiate into any type of cell (Murnaghan).They are also more favorable in research because they possess special qualities that adult stem cells do not have. Important adult stem cells can only differentiate into the type of cells in the tissue where they are found and embryonic stem cells are fresher and younger and can be grown in the laboratory more easily (Murnaghan). For these reasons, embryonic stem cells are highly valued by the scientific community as being important for scientific advancements, thus they are also a target for many religious groups who have different beliefs about human embryos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Embryonic stem cell research has developed into an ethical debate concerning the creation, treatment, and destruction of human embryos. For example, under the Christian faith, Catholics share a moral objection, rooted in the belief that the fertilized egg is a representation of potential human life. Catholics, many of whom are pro-life, disprove of stem cell research because they are concerned with the rights and status of the embryo as an early aged human life form. They believe harvested embryonic stem cells are human beings and extracting these cells and destroying the embryo constitutes murder (Vestal). The way in which Catholics view embryonic stem cell research is similar to the way in which they view abortion; in both cases, Catholics believe in the preservation of human life and that human life begins at conception. In his 1995 encyclical, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Gospel of Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, the late Pope John Paul II wrote, \u201cHuman embryos obtained in vitro are human beings and are subjects with rights; their dignity and right to life must be respected from the first moment of their existence\u2026\u201d \u00a0Therefore, within the church, human life is sacred, precious, and inviolable the moment the sperm fertilizes an egg cell. Moreover, an examination of the Bible illustrates that Catholics believe that at the moment of conception, the potential human person is granted a spiritual soul that it is in God\u2019s \u201ccare even before [birth]\u201d(Isaiah 44:2) and \u201cpresent with the Lord\u201d(2 Cor. 5:8) after death. The idea of stem cell research points to concerns about when human life begins. Catholics believe it begins at conception, yet other religious groups believe otherwise and therefore favor stem cell research.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Stem cell research has developed into a controversial debate amongst other monotheistic and polytheistic religions, some of which even support embryonic stem cell research. Under the Christian faith, the Episcopal Church, for example, has declared itself in favor of stem cell research as long as the embryos used would have been destroyed otherwise (The Pew Forum). Similarly, the Presbyterian Church in the United States reaffirmed its position in favor of stem cell research that is intended to \u201crestore health to the suffering.\u201d(The Pew Forum). Although both Catholicism and these faiths worship Christ, they do not agree on the ethical viewpoints regarding embryonic stem cell research. Followers of other monotheistic religions, such as Islam, have no explicit ruling on this issue and they tend to have mixed viewpoints. Some individuals of the Islamic faith believe embryos do not have souls while others believe the termination of an embryo is morally impermissible (The Pew Forum). Furthermore, Judaism supports embryonic stem cell research as long as it is used for medical purposes. Rabbi Levi Yitschak Halperin of the Institute for Science and Jewish Law states, \u201cAs long as it has not been implanted in the womb and it is still a frozen fertilized egg, it does not have the status of an embryo at all and there is no prohibition to destroy it\u2026\u201d (The Pew Forum) Lastly, both Hinduism and Buddhism do not directly address the issue. Buddhists, however, refer to two teachings: the prohibition against harming others and the pursuit of knowledge. Therefore, some believers argue that stem cell research is in accordance to a request for knowledge, while other states that it violates the notion of harming others (The Pew Forum). Different religion groups uphold their own unique beliefs on stem cell research, allowing an individual to develop his or her own personal perspective concerning the subject. However, it is also important to note that perhaps stem cells do not have to be taken from human embryos. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the movie, \u201cCutting Through the Spin,\u201d Reverend Dr. Tadeusz Pacholczyk, a priest of the diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts and a PhD graduate with a neuroscience degree from Yale, discusses the science and ethics of stem cell research, providing evidence for a solution. He argues the idea that stem cells can be extracted from fetuses, umbilical cords, placentas, bone marrow, and even cadavers. In other words, there are ways to use stem cells without extracting them from a human embryo. He states that thousands of patients have been cured of their respective diseases with the use of umbilical cord stem cells, for example. A patient with Krabbe\u2019s disease was cured after umbilical cord stem cells were able to create the patient\u2019s missing enzyme. In another case, bone marrow stem cells were put into a patient\u2019s damaged heart muscle and were able to repair the scar. These particular cases show evidence that embryonic stem cells do not necessarily have to be used. The belief that embryonic stem cells are the most promising is quite plausibly a myth. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Scientists must continue to use stem cells from alternate sources in the human body and religious advocates must keep an open mind, so as to allow scientific innovation and exploration to improve the health of society. Those who support the study of stem cells do not necessarily oppose religious beliefs, but rather they have their own unique viewpoints and above all else, support the probable cures that may exist for fatal diseases. In contrast to the Christian faith, in which members believe that life begins at conception, supporters of stem cell research and biologists state that a human individual begins to develop at the primitive-streak formation, which appears fourteen days after embryonic development (Lee, George). These different viewpoints on when human life begins, in addition to other religious beliefs regarding self-harm and preservation (Buddhism), or \u201crestoring life to the suffering\u201d (Presbyterian Church) should all be taken into consideration when making scientific advancements with the use of stem cells. There should also be more research conducted to improve the success of stem cells that are not taken from human embryos .Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson\u2019s, states, \u201cLet\u2019s help people. Let\u2019s use that to save lives.\u201d Stem cells have become important for people\u2019s survival and this principle should not be overlooked in order to ensure that people can lead healthy lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Works Cited </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Cutting Through the Spin.

With whole metagenomic sequencing, it is possible to obtain and analyze every piece of genetic material in the sample. As we being to learn more about the world, it becomes evident that there is more that is unknown. The crAssphage is an example of a \u201cknown unknown\u201d because through metagenomics, the virus\u2019s genome has been built and certain properties can be interpreted from the genome, but it has never been seen under a microscope and there is much still unknown about the virus. Metagenomics have opened the doors to analyzing multiple sequences and determining the ecology of the environment. Because metagenomics is becoming more prevalent, it is essential to understand the potential of this growing field. I hope that by learning about the potential of metagenomics, new ideas can sprout from using this technology in order to help others.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-752\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>CrAssphage</h4><span style=\"font-weight:400\">: Bacteriophage with a circular double-stranded DNA viral genome, 97 kilobase pairs that contain 80 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). It was named after the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">cr</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">oss-</span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">ass</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">embly analysis software used to find the viral genome.</span></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><h4>Interest</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The crAssphage caught my attention because it was discovered very recently in 2014, and was found solely through metagenomics. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Metagenomics is the study of genetic material directly from environmental samples such as the soil or the human gut. With whole metagenomic sequencing, it is possible to obtain and analyze every piece of genetic material in the sample. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">According to Dr. Robert Edwards, who is the principal investigator of the crAssphage project, the bacteriophage is very widespread and found in every other person. It has also been on earth as long as humans have roamed (Price, 2014). This bacteriophage has never been viewed under a microscope, yet the entire genome has been constructed based on the DNA sequences found in metagenomic databases through cross assembly analysis. Dr. Edwards describes the analysis strategy as \u201cidentifying the phage in different samples, putting it together in one bucket and analyzing them as one group\u201d (Price, 2014). In other words, they identified genetic sequences that was present in all the samples, and then piece them together based on similarity. Properties of the phage and its possible hosts have been deciphered through analysis of the constructed genome. I decided to further study this bacteriophage, and find out what potential it could have in future studies.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Discovery/Identification</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the first article published about the crAssphage from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Nature Communications</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> by Dutilh </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. (2014), a team of researchers used metagenomic strategies in order to assemble the crAssphage genome, encode proteins, predict the phage-host, and determine the ubiquity of crAssphage in public metagenome databases. In order to assemble the genome, the team used an analysis strategy termed cross-assembly analysis. Fecal samples from twelve different individuals were sampled and analyzed. It was noticed that a cluster of viral DNA, about 97 kilobase pairs long (ten times larger than the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) was found in all the samples (Price, 2014; Yong, 2014). According to Dutilh </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">., around 75% of the DNA from any stool sample- and as much as 99%- won\u2019t match any of the known viral sequences in databases (Price, 2014). After checking the genome against this list, Dutilh </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. determined that the crAssphage was a new virus. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Prevalence</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The crAssphage is a bacteriophage, which is a virus that infects bacteria. Interestingly, the human gut virome is dominated by bacteriophages that are mostly unknown (Minot </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">., 2013). However, it was found that the phage is widespread and abundant after searching through many public metagenomic libraries. Dr. Edwards states that the phage is very common and is likely to be in every person, if not every other person. The team of researchers predicted the host bacteria as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bacteriodetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, a common phylum of gut bacteria that live toward the end of the intestinal tract in humans, and suspect to play a major role between gut bacteria and obesity. Perhaps the crAssphage can determine the abundance of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bacteriodetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> that can be present in the human gut and have an effect on the human gut ecology. Unfortunately, it is not certain if </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bacteroidetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> is the clear host for the phage. Homology searches were done and results did not provide clear clues as to what the bacterial host(s) is for this phage. In order to determine the true host of the phage, the phage must be isolated and produced, which has not been successful so far.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">No sources have mentioned if the bacteriophage is pathogenic to humans. Due to the abundance and large presence, it is not likely that the phage is dangerous to humans. Although the method of transmission is unknown, it is predicted that the phage is transmitted from mother to child (Prince, 2014). More research is needed in order to confirm what the transmission sequence is. According to Dr. Edwards, he is curious about the mechanism of entry and what the phage does to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Bacteriodetes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> in future studies (Price, 2014).</span></p>\n<p><h4>Future Direction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In order to study the mechanism of entry and replication of the phage, a mass amount must be made in order to perform tests. However, it is not possible if the host is not grown. Unfortunately, the crAssphage has not been isolated in order to study its mechanism of entry and replication. \u00a0Since most gut bacteria won\u2019t grow easily in a lab, the phage is difficult to rear (Price, 2014; Yong, 2014). Not enough is known in order to determine the life cycle of the virus, like whether the bacteriophage is a lytic phage such as Bacteriophage T7 or a temperate phage such as Bacteriophage \u03bb. In an attempt to isolate the bacteriophage, a plaque assay was performed. However, the results were unfavorable and Dutilh </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">et al</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. determined the plaques that did form are from different bacteriophages and not the crAssphage. The research team determined that more information about the phage itself is needed in order to find better ways to isolate the virus. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Takeaway</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Ever since metagenomics was introduced, there has been a great effort towards discovering viruses that are known to exist, but have not been identified -also referred to as the \u201cknown unknown.\u201d After a sample has been processed, data is given back as mass amounts of genetic sequences and most are identifiable after aligning or matching the sequences with an annotated reference database. These \u201cknown unknown\u201d viruses are shown as genetic sequences that are difficult to identify even after using standard methods (Dutilh, 2014). The team consisted of both biologists and computer scientists that worked together in order to find the virus. They believe that metagenomics is the next step into personalized phage-therapy in the clinical world. By utilizing methods in order to discover unknown viruses, one could isolate and identify a virus, and then find a personalized treatment for that one specific virus (Yong, 2014). This could be a new path in the world of medicine. </span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Dutilh, Bas E (2014).

I hope that this review serves to encourage anyone with an interest in science to read this book, or at least to realize the book\u2019s importance in the scientific community.\u201d<span id=\"more-757\"></span></p>\n<p>\u201cThe discovery of the structure by Crick and Watson, with all its biological implications, has been one of the major scientific events of this century.\u201d When Sir Lawrence Bragg wrote this for the foreword, he had no idea how influential this event would actually be for scientific progress even decades later. Following this major scientific event, deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, has begun to be commonly revered as \u201cthe blueprint of life,\u201d further highlighting its significance. With newfound knowledge of the structure of DNA, our understanding of this macromolecule has been essential for progress in many scientific and medical fields. With the great advancements facilitated by this finding, many people have begun to overlook the elaborate scientific process that was necessary to bring the fields of genetics and molecular biology to where they are today.</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Double Helix</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> tells the story of the famed discovery of the structure of DNA. This book is particularly enticing because it describes the whole process from the perspective of James D. Watson, of the \u2018Watson and Crick\u2019 most of us learned about in high school biology. It is not just a chronological history of their contribution to science, but a personal interpretation of everything that happened from Watson\u2019s 1950 arrival in Europe to the 1953 publication of \u201cMolecular Structure of Nucleic Acids\u201d in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Nature</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. As well as elaborating the historic discovery of DNA\u2019s molecular structure, this book exemplifies the views and opinions of an American scientist living in England in the mid-twentieth century, exposing much of the laboratory politics that still exist today.</span></p>\n<p><h4>A Personal Account</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In 1951, James Dewey Watson, an American who had recently earned a Ph.D. in Zoology, joined the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University with the hopes of discovering the structure of DNA. There, he met Francis Crick, a British scientist \u201cwho occasionally did experiments but more often was immersed in the theories.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">A testament to the fact that this is a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">personal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> account, Watson describes Crick as loud, boisterous, and \u201cenormously excited.\u201d Just like in anyone\u2019s own account, Watson\u2019s opinions and biases shine through in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Double Helix</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">These biases come to light again in his utterly frank descriptions of Rosalind Franklin. We know now that Franklin\u2019s X-ray diffraction photos were crucial for Watson and Crick to verify the double helical structure of DNA, but what was Watson\u2019s opinion of her?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The first indication of what Watson and Crick thought of Franklin was that they called her \u201cRosy\u201d, a name meant to establish their superiority, when she wasn\u2019t around. Even Maurice Wilkins, Franklin\u2019s supervisor, joined Watson and Crick in depreciating her abilities.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">I suspect that in the beginning Maurice hoped that Rosy would calm down. Yet mere inspection suggested that she would not easily bend. By choice she did not emphasize her feminine qualities. Though her features were strong, she was not unattractive and might have been quite stunning had she taken even a mild interest in clothes\u2026 There was never lipstick to contrast with her straight black hair, while at the age of thirty-one her dresses showed all the imagination of English bluestocking adolescents\u2026 Clearly Rosy had to go or be put in her place\u2026 given her belligerent moods, it would be very difficult for Maurice to maintain a dominant position that would allow him to think unhindered about DNA.</p>\n<p>Despite this clearly sexist view of her, it becomes apparent that Watson, Crick, and Wilkins are simply intimidated by this strong and determined personality in a woman.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">These opinions of Franklin were likely, in part, due to social norms. Throughout the book, Watson frequently alludes to the expectations in British society. In England, he frequently attended social gatherings that allowed him to interact with experts in his field, something he evidently did not participate in in the U.S.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cIt was my first experience with the high life, associated in my mind with decaying European aristocracy. An important truth was slowly entering my head: a scientist\u2019s life might be interesting socially as well as intellectually.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In addition, he illustrates how important it was to look cleaned up in British society. When Odile, Crick\u2019s wife, first met him, she \u201chad told Francis that a bald American was coming to work in the lab.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">With these insights into the daily interactions and societal expectations, this novel provides an interesting look into 1950s England through the eyes of a young American scientist.</span></p>\n<p><h4>As a Scientist</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In addition to providing an inside view of British society, another fascinating aspect of this book is that it provides present-day scientists, like myself, with insight into one of the most important scientific discoveries of the last century. As a student in a scientific discipline, I am very aware of the structure of DNA and its function in genetics. It is incredibly exciting to read the story of their scientific journey and put the pieces together along with them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">While reading this book, I found myself reasoning through their logic with them. At some point during their time in the lab, Dr. Linus Pauling, a Nobel Prize winning chemist who was also working on the structure of DNA, proposed a triple helical structure. The suggested model had the phosphate backbone in the center of the axis, with the nucleotide bases sticking out. I remember reading this and thinking, \u201cThe phosphate backbone can\u2019t be in the middle! The phosphates are negative; they\u2019d repel each other!\u201d Today, this is an obvious flaw with the triple helix model. At the time, though, this was something scientists had to figure out for themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Today, many of the questions they had regarding DNA\u2019s structure have answers that would be obvious to present-day scientists, but at the time, this was a puzzle they had to solve. It is, in every sense of the word, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">fun</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> to read along and put the pieces of the puzzle together along with them, already knowing the final answer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Looking back on Watson and Crick\u2019s deduction of this critical feature of DNA will resonate with modern-day scientists. We still feel the pressure they felt to publish before someone beats us to it; we still assess the validity of other publications in our field and use them to build on our own hypotheses; we still work for months or years to answer a question that we\u2019re not sure we can answer; and we still come up with the wrong answer from time to time, but keep trying regardless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In short, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Double Helix</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, by James D. Watson, is a stimulating account of the discovery of DNA that sheds light on both the social climate of mid-twentieth century England and the scientific process that led to one of the greatest discoveries of the past century.</span></p>\n</div>"

TTH is characterized by generalized, nonthrobbing pain in the absence of migraine-induced incapacity, nausea, or photophobia. Tension-type headache normally produces mild to moderate pain often described as viselike. It originates bilaterally in the occipital or frontal lobes and extends to the rest of the brain. TTH occasionally causes unilateral or pulsating pain. Two prominent features distinguish TTH from migraine. First, TTH does not lead to nausea and vomiting. Second, it is not made worse by physical activity, light, sounds, or smells (Silberstein 2014).</p>\n<p><h4>Classification</h4></p>\n<p>There are two types of TTH categorized by attack frequency: episodic TTH refers to the condition in which patients suffer headaches at a rate of less than 15 headache days a month, and chronic TTH involves 15 or more headache days a month. Both types may contribute to significant disability, especially when patients also suffer from migraine, comorbid depression, or anxiety (Taylor 2016b). Episodic TTH is further broken down to two subtypes: frequent episodic (1 to 14 headache days per month) and infrequent episodic (less than 1 headache day per month). The duration of episodic headaches ranges from half an hour to several days. Episodic TTH typically starts several hours after waking and increases in intensity as the day progresses. The pain intensity associated with this type of TTH is rarely sufficient to disrupt sleep. Chronic TTH can be triggered by sleep disturbances, stress, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, neck pain, and eyestrain (Silberstein 2014). This type of TTH varies in intensity throughout the day but is almost always present.</p>\n<p>The classification of these three types of TTH is critical, as each has its own distinct underlying pathophysiology, influence on daily functioning, and treatment methods. For example, peripheral mechanisms are more closely associated with episodic TTH, while central mechanisms are more relevant in chronic TTH. More specifically, the development of episodic TTH is contingent upon the peripheral activation or sensitization of myofascial nociceptors, whereas the transition from episodic to chronic TTH relies on the sensitization of pain pathways in the central nervous system established through prolonged exposure to nociceptive stimuli from pericranial myofascial tissues (Bendtsen et al. 2015). With regard to the treatment of these different types of TTH, infrequent episodic TTH usually calls for an acute symptomatic approach, while frequent episodic TTH and chronic TTH require prophylactic interventions. Each type of TTH can be additionally sorted based on the concurrent presence or absence of pericranial muscle tenderness.</p>\n<p>Neurologic consultation normally only follows lengthy experience of headaches. In particular, TTH is the most prevalent type of primary headache in the general population. Despite the overall high prevalence of TTH, most patients with TTH have the infrequent episodic subtype. Some physicians argue that this type of TTH is not a disease. Instead, they regard it as a normal phenomenon that does not call for medical attention. Since most individuals with TTH have infrequent, mild headaches, only a small percentage of the affected population seek medical care to address such condition. Women have a slightly higher probability of experiencing TTH than men. This asymmetry is especially conspicuous in frequent episodic and chronic tension-type headaches.</p>\n<p>Tension-type headache was previously known by different names, including stress or tension headache, muscle-contraction headache, psychomyogenic headache, and psychogenic headache (Taylor 2016a). The term tension was initially chosen to reflect tension headache\u2019s suspected etiology: excessive stress or tension leading to muscle contraction. Traditionally, it was thought that sustained contracture of pericranial muscles causes TTH, though the notion is no longer accepted.</p>\n<p><h4>Pathophysiology</h4></p>\n<p>Although the precise mechanisms through which TTH develops remain unknown, the pathogenesis of TTH most likely involves multiple factors. Different factors have varying degrees of influence over the development of TTH, depending on the type. For example, environment plays a greater role in the development of episodic TTH than chronic TTH. In contrast, genetic factors have more of an impact on the development of chronic TTH than episodic TTH. Nitric oxide has been identified as a potential molecular trigger for pain associated with TTH. Tension-type headache\u2019s underlying pain mechanisms are likely dynamic to account for the observed diversity in frequency and intensity of headache attacks. They vary not only between individuals, but also within individuals over time from one attack to the next.</p>\n<p><h4>Diagnosis</h4></p>\n<p>The diagnosis of TTH is reached through a clinical evaluation consisting of symptoms assessment and a physical examination that includes a neurologic examination. There are no diagnostic tests specific for TTH. During the evaluation, effort is made to identify potential triggers for chronic tension-type headache in order to devise targeted treatment plans. In addition, practitioners look out for differences that set TTH apart from a forme fruste of migraine to avoid misdiagnosis. These headaches possess certain features of migraine and certain features of tension-type headache, but they differ from TTH in their responsiveness to migraine-specific drugs. Physicians should be cautious about diagnosing severe headaches as TTH, because severe tension-type headaches are rare. Due to extensive symptom overlap between TTH and secondary headaches, it is essential for doctors to closely observe the temporal pattern of headaches to reach an accurate diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Patients with TTH usually have normal results from physical and neurologic examinations, blood work, brain imaging with CT or MRI scans, and spinal fluid analyses (Taylor 2016a). The most prominent abnormal finding in patients with TTH is increased pericranial muscle tenderness, or muscle tenderness in the head, neck, or shoulders. Pericranial muscle tenderness acts as a signal for the intensity and frequency of TTH attacks and generally worsens during a headache. The presence or absence of pericranial muscle tenderness can be discerned through an examination by manual palpation. Manual palpation describes the application of firm pressure with the second and third fingers making small rotating movements on the pericranial muscles, including the frontal, temporal, masseter, pterygoid, sternocleidomastoid, splenius, and trapezius muscles (Taylor 2016a).</p>\n<p>Because pure TTH is a rather featureless headache, practitioners need to be attentive of all possible diagnoses when examining a patient. In particular, physicians encounter diagnostic challenges when patients present with atypical or missing symptoms, symptoms that overlap with other types of headaches, or an incomplete self-report of symptoms. When a patient with a normal physical examination displays a stable pattern of episodic and disabling headaches, practitioners should consider the diagnosis of migraine if there is no evidence that suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p>Another condition that closely resembles TTH is brain tumor headache, though it is rarer. Its features are typically nonspecific and dependent upon tumor location, size, and rate of growth (Taylor 2016a). Brain tumor headache is generally bilateral though it can be restricted to the side of the tumor. A third type of headache that shares similar features with TTH is medication overuse headache (MOH). MOH is a secondary headache that normally results from treating an episodic headache disorder such as TTH with frequent and excessive amounts of acute symptomatic medications. Therefore, practitioners should suspect MOH in patients who adopt a pharmacologic approach to treatment. For patients with unilateral pain, cervicogenic headache is a probable diagnosis. Pain from cervicogenic headache ranges from moderate to severe intensity and radiates from occipital to frontal regions. It can be exacerbated by head movements and is nonlancinating.</p>\n<p><h4>Treatment and Prevention</h4></p>\n<p>Treatment of TTH consists of two major components: analgesics, and behavioral and psychologic interventions. Additionally, some drugs used to prevent migraine such as amitriptyline are also effective in preventing chronic tension-type headache (Silberstein 2014). For most cases of tension-type headaches, over-the-counter analgesics such as aspirin and acetaminophen provide significant relief. Behavioral and psychologic interventions involve relaxation and stress management techniques. These treatment methods are especially potent when used in conjunction with drug therapy.</p>\n<p>Patients with frequent episodic or chronic TTH should consider preventive treatment as a way to alleviate disabling pain. Preventive treatment of TTH involves both drugs and nonpharmacologic approaches such as behavioral and cognitive therapies. Many of these preventive measures are derived from those used for migraine because the two conditions share significant overlap. These efforts aim to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration; improve responsiveness to treatment of acute attacks; ameliorate function; and decrease disability (Taylor 2016b).</p>\n<p>The pharmacologic approach typically involves prescription of tricyclic antidepressants such as<a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+amitriptyline-drug-information?source=see_link\">amitriptyline</a> (Semenov 2015). Other potential candidates for TTH prophylaxis include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as mirtazapine and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+venlafaxine-drug-information?source=see_link\">venlafaxine</a>, and anticonvulsants such as <a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+gabapentin-drug-information?source=see_link\">gabapentin</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+topiramate-drug-information?source=see_link\">topiramate</a> (Banzi et al. 2015). Practitioners should be cautious about prescribing these medications because current clinical data lacks sufficient evidence to support their efficacy.</p>\n<p>Nonpharmocologic preventive treatments include biofeedback, relaxation, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. They aim to identify and remove behavioral headache triggers, thereby preventing headaches. A combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmocologic approaches can be an effective treatment method. For example, combined tricyclic antidepressant and stress management therapy is recommended for patients with frequent episodic or chronic TTH. Those that prefer pharmacologic intervention over behavioral therapy should consider tricyclic therapy with\u00a0<a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+amitriptyline-drug-information?source=see_link\">amitriptyline</a>. In contrast, for patients who wish to avoid or cannot tolerate pharmacologic intervention, electromyography (EMG) biofeedback in conjunction with relaxation therapy is a viable treatment option.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Bibliography</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Banzi R, Cusi C, Randazzo C, Sterzi R, Tedesco C, Moja L. 2015.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cI chose to write about Tourette Syndrome because someone who is dear to me was diagnosed with it. Watching him struggle at a young age, I could only imagine how difficult it must have been dealing with strange and disapproving looks from peers and teachers. Through the gradual decline of symptoms over the years, he learned to cope with his tics and sought to educate others about the syndrome. Inspired by his story, I wrote this case report in hopes of share his journey with others.\u201d</span><br/>\n<span id=\"more-829\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by tics, which are involuntary, nonrhythmic, repetitive movements and vocalizations. In about half of the patients with Tourette syndrome, tic symptoms decline during adolescence and disappear by age 18. While it is possible for tics to persist into adulthood, in 40 to 45 percent of the cases tics\u2019 severity gradually declines. In this case report, the patient was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome at the age of eight and continues to display tics at the present age of 18.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Case Report</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The patient is an eighteen-year-old Asian male residing in suburban California. At age eight, he presented to a psychiatric outpatient department with a 2-month history of repetitive involuntary eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and throat clearing. The intensity and duration of these motor and vocal tics varied, with no single episode lasting more than a few seconds, but he was never completely symptom-free. The frequency of his tics ranged from many times a day to once every few days. These tics were more severe when the patient was fatigued or stressed and less severe when the patient was mentally focused. The patient could voluntarily suppress the tics for a few minutes at a time, but such effort induced great stress and restlessness. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Prior to displaying symptoms of Tourette syndrome, the patient was reported by his family to possess a sunny disposition. He excelled in his academic endeavors and maintained friendly relationships with his peers. With the emergence of tics, the patient began to feel embarrassed at school as his symptoms drew the attention of his teachers and fellow students. His teachers attributed the symptoms to typical disruptive classroom behavior and relayed their observations to the patient\u2019s family. When the behavior persisted for more than a month, the teachers recommended the parents to seek professional assistance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The patient\u2019s family sought medical expertise two months after the onset of symptoms when the patient was eight. The patient </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">had a normal delivery with no antenatal or postnatal complications and experienced no developmental problems. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">He has no history of psychotic symptoms, hyperactivity, obsessiveness, compulsiveness, or substance abuse. There is no family history of mental disorders. The psychiatrist performed a continuous performance test (CPT) of attention, revealing borderline severity of Tourette syndrome. No triggering factors could be identified. Observed symptoms included excessive eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and throat clearing. A physical examination showed no other abnormalities. The neuropsychological examination revealed that the patient had intact thought processes and higher mental functioning. Comorbidities of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were excluded by clinical interview. Lead poisoning was eliminated as a potential cause of the observed symptoms through a laboratory blood test.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The psychiatrist educated the patient and his family about Tourette syndrome and recommended that they speak with the patient\u2019s teachers about his condition so that individualized support and supervision could be provided. Since the patient\u2019s symptoms did not interfere significantly with his social and academic performance, the psychiatrist eliminated medication as a treatment option. With a newfound understanding of Tourette syndrome, the patient was able to better cope with his symptoms and his negative emotional responses to the disorder declined. His confidence was gradually restored with the support of his family, friends, and teachers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The patient\u2019s eye blinking persisted for two years but decreased in intensity and frequency until it completely disappeared at the age of ten. However, he continues to display shoulder shrugging and throat clearing at the current age of 18, though their severity has been steadily decreasing. Presently, the patient exhibits these symptoms at a frequency of a few tic episodes per month, each lasting one to three seconds.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Discussion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tourette syndrome is one of the three tic disorders recognized by the </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> under neurodevelopmental disorders (APA 2013). The exact cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown, though studies suggest that it involves complex interactions among social, environmental, and genetic factors. One hypothesis is that defect in the striatal-thalamic-cortical spinal system causes disinhibition of the motor and limbic system, leading to Tourette syndrome. The disorder is often transmitted bilineally, but scientists haven\u2019t been able to identify specific genes responsible for producing the symptoms. The offspring of parents with Tourette syndrome faces a 22 percent risk in developing the disorder, while siblings of Tourette patients have a risk of around 8 percent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The diagnosis of Tourette syndrome does not involve any laboratory tests. Instead, a clinical evaluation is performed following the DSM guidelines. To avoid misdiagnosis, Tourette syndrome is characterized by three critical components. First is the presence of both motor and vocal tics for more than a year, though they do not need to occur simultaneously. Second, the tic onset must be before age 18 years. Third, tics must not be caused by substance intake or another medical condition. A family history of similar neurological symptoms supports the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. The diagnosis of Tourette syndrome can also be buttressed by the presence of comorbidities including ADHD and OCD. Tourette syndrome can be isolated from other hyperkinetic movement disorders such as chorea, dystonia, athetosis, myoclonus, and paroxysmal dyskinesia by its two unique qualities: the ability to suppress tics and the premonitory sensations that often precede tics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Education about Tourette syndrome to people who interact with the patient is key to managing the disorder. Only when symptoms of Tourette syndrome interfere with social, academic, or occupational performance is intervention warranted. Treatment methods are directed to eliminate the most serious symptoms, including those of comorbidities such as ADHD, OCD, and mood disorders. When tics are mild and nondisabling, education and counseling present an effective plan to treat Tourette syndrome. But when tics become troublesome, medications such as </span><a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+tetrabenazine-drug-information?source=see_link\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">tetrabenazine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, </span><a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+fluphenazine-drug-information?source=see_link\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">fluphenazine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, and or</span><a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+risperidone-pediatric-drug-information?source=see_link\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">risperidone</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> are prescribed to alleviate the symptoms. Fluphenazine is a dopamine receptor blocker whereas tetrabenazine is a </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">dopamine depleter that inhibits vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2). Both drugs work to reduce tics\u2019 frequency and intensity by approximately 60 to 80 percent (Jankovic 2015). It is advantageous to use the latter antidopaminergic drug because it provides the same benefits </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">without the harmful side effect of </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">tardive dyskinesias, a disorder leading to involuntary, repetitive body movements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to the pharmacologic approach, behavioral therapy is recommended as an alternative intervention strategy. More specifically, habit reversal training (HRT) is implemented to control tics. There are two components of HRT: tic-awareness training, which focuses on recognizing early signs of tic onset, and competing-response training, which develops a voluntary movement that opposes the tic. </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">There are several limitations that apply to this treatment method. First, in order for this behavioral management to be successful, the parents and the therapist must be well versed in the HRT techniques so they can be actively involved in the training process. Such endeavor requires a substantial commitment of time and effort on the part of the patient, the therapist, and the parents. Due to these rigorous demands, it is unlikely that all parties will be able to maintain the necessary compliance with the treatment plan for sustained benefit to be observed. Another concern addresses the possibility that the patient\u2019s attention and learning may be negatively impacted by the mental effort required to fully comply with HRT.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">If tics are concentrated in specific muscles in the body, botulinum toxin injections into the affected regions offer a viable treatment option. To treat the comorbid condition of ADHD, alpha adrenergic agonists such as clonidine and guanfacine are used to suppress related behavioral symptoms, especially those associated with impulse control and rage attacks. Guanfacine is preferred over clonidine because it requires fewer daily doses and is less sedating. To treat symptoms of OCD, psychiatrists often prescribe </span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://vpn.lib.ucdavis.edu/contents/,DanaInfo=www.uptodate.com+fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information?source=see_link\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">fluoxetine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u00a0starting at 20 mg daily (Jankovic 2015).</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Bibliography</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">[APA] American Psychiatric Association. c2013.

Little did I know that as I was gathering my sources, a new GMO dispute would emerge, this one revolving around bioengineered non-browning apples. Thus I switched my focus from the bill to the arrival of these apples to stores across the U.S. \u2014 an arrival that means an investigation into the history and science behind genetically engineered food products is even timelier than I originally thought.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1014\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>History in brief</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In grocery stores nationwide this month, Arctic Apples are set to hit the shelves. These apples, produced by Okanagan Specialty Fruits (OSF), have been genetically modified so that they do not brown when their cells are ruptured, unlike all other apples currently on the market. A blog post on OSF\u2019s Arctic Apples website provides an overview of the techniques the company used to create such apples; below the post, comments abound. The reactions to Arctic Apples in these comments range from \u201cWow, it is amazing what you can do with biotechnology these days\u201d to \u201cWe don\u2019t want our children to eat your poison!\u201d [1]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are no stranger to controversy. In 1975 \u2014 decades before the first GMOs were to appear in grocery stores \u2014 a hodgepodge group of scientists, lawyers, journalists, and government officials met to discuss recombinant DNA (rDNA) [2, 3]. This conference was prompted by recent scientific advancements pertaining to rDNA, which pieces together DNA strands from two different organisms. Though several other meetings had taken place before it, it was the 1975 conference that history would remember, as it set the groundwork for subsequent guidelines on rDNA research without wholly restricting such research [3, 4].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In the years following the conference, the realm of genetic engineering split in several directions. Some scientists saw rDNA\u2019s potential to revolutionize medication, while others were more interested in its applications to the environment. The first patent for a GMO, issued in 1981, was in fact for a bacterium that could degrade complex hydrocarbons such as crude oil [5]. Around the same time, research on the correlation between the enzyme polygalacturonase (PG) and fruit softening was in its initial stages at Calgene, Inc. Researchers found that inserting an antisense copy of the gene that produces PG into tomatoes could delay their ripening. In 1994, the company introduced such tomatoes to the market under the name FLAVR SAVR tomatoes. Though demand for the tomatoes was high, the profits were slim due to the cost of making them, and public concern over their safety eventually knocked them out of grocery stores [6].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Despite this failure, GMO food crop research blazed ahead. By 1996, genetically modified crops covered more than 4.2 million acres of the planet [7]. That number had risen to 444 million by 2015 \u2014 the first year, in fact, that the global acreage decreased from one year to another [8].</span></p>\n<p><h4>More recent developments</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">GMOs were again thrust into the public arena in July of last year when then-president Barack Obama signed a bill requiring labels on genetically modified foods. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has until 2018 to iron out the details of the law, and food companies will be granted more time after that to comply with the new regulations. The companies will also have a range of GMO disclosure options: text, a symbol, a phone number or even a QR code directing consumers to more information. It is worth noting, however, that the law defines bioengineered food products as containing \u201cgenetic material.\u201d This means that the GMOs most commonly found in stores \u2014 corn syrup and canola oil, for example \u2014 will likely be exempt because they are highly refined. In addition, the law\u2019s language indicates that it will likely not apply to meat, poultry, or eggs [9, 10, 11].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">The federal law came about in response to the passage of more restrictive labeling laws in Vermont, Connecticut, and Maine [12]. These laws, in turn, stemmed partly from public uncertainty regarding the safety of GMOs, despite the general consensus in the scientific community that GMOs have not been shown to pose any serious health or environmental risks [13]. A 2016 U.S. survey, conducted as part of the Annenberg Science Knowledge survey project, found that 88 percent of participants supported mandatory labeling laws, and 91 percent said that people have the right to know if there are GMOs in their food. These opinions contrast sharply, however, with the fact that 58 percent said they have only a fair or poor understanding of GMOs; only 1 in 5 participants even knew that scientists have not found any evidence indicating that GMOs have adverse effects on human health [14].</span></p>\n<p><h4>The debut of Arctic Apples</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Amidst this confusion, Arctic Apples entered the scene. Scientists have known for decades that in the presence of oxygen \u2014 which abounds when, say, someone bites or cuts an apple \u2014 the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO) reacts with phenols in the apple cells, eventually resulting in brown pigmentation [1, 15]. It was the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Australia that developed the idea of using gene silencing techniques to inhibit PPO, though their research focused on potatoes rather than apples [16]. OSF licensed these techniques in 1997, spent years on research and development, and finally unveiled Arctic Apples in 2015 [16, 17].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">For Arctic Apples, a gene sequence called GEN-03 lies at the heart of the gene silencing process. GEN-03 is written such that in apples with the sequence, PPO expression is reduced dramatically [16]. OSF\u2019s science team uses </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, an organism often used for transformations in the biotechnology world, to introduce GEN-03 into the leaf tissue [18]. Attached to the GEN-03 sequence is a marker gene that produces the protein NPTII, which confers resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin; therefore, to ensure that a transformation was successful, scientists test the leaf tissue for kanamycin resistance [19]. If it passes this test, the tissue is allowed to grow into a plantlet, which is then grafted onto apple rootstock that will be planted and grow like a normal apple tree [18].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span> <span style=\"font-weight:400\">Though some argue that non-browning apples are not a worthwhile endeavor, others point out that millions of pounds of apples are wasted each year because their brown pigmentation makes them less appealing to consumers [17, 20]. For its part, OSF adds that apples that brown enzymatically also degrade antioxidants and other nutrients, meaning Arctic Apples may be healthier than their traditional counterparts [21]. Early survey results indicated that 80 percent of consumers were interested in buying the apples once they were commercially available, but only time will tell their true success in the market [20].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">It is a strange time for Arctic Apples to make their debut, as the new labeling law will apply to them [9]. The future of not only these apples, but GMOs in general, remains uncertain. It must be noted, however, that humans have been tampering with food crop genetics for thousands of years, beginning with farmers cross-breeding crops to end up with desirable hybrids [22]. In consideration of this fact, it seems likely that despite public bickering over GMOs, they will remain a part of life \u2014 at least in some capacity \u2014 for years to come. How about them apples?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> Arctic Apples. \u201cHow\u2019d We \u2018Make\u2019 a Nonbrowning Apple?\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Arctic Apples</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4> \u201cI became interested in the impact of epigenetics after reading an article about the effects of environmental pollution on generations beyond the population subjected to the pollution. So much focus in human biology is placed on genetics; it is fascinating that a closely related and significant topic exists that is unique from genetics itself. As epigenetic research progresses, I think it will find a large role in advancing healthcare as well as our understandings about humans\u2019 biological identities.\u201d</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1030\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At the forefront of genetic research is an area that extends beyond the genome\u2019s contents. The mounting research in the growing field of epigenetics indicates that a key to limiting health vulnerabilities in future generations is an investigation into greater interventions for the current population. The field also presents society with a new perspective to grapple with regarding the biological factors that respond to and shape our experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Epigenetic factors function by modifying DNA expression through the attachment of methyl groups and histones to DNA in a cell\u2019s nucleus. These chemical groups and proteins work to either silence or activate genes, altering the expression of genetic material.[1] Epigenetic factors can change in response to environmental factors such as chemical exposure or nutrition.[2] </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Epigenetic inheritance is the process by which offspring can sometimes inherit the altered state of their parents\u2019 genes. Thus, the effects of epigenetic alterations could be carried from the parent who experienced the environmental stimulus to offspring who have not. Since epigenetic alterations can lead to health issues, this inheritance process has implications for the occurrence of various health problems through generations. Further research is needed, however, to determine the extent to which epigenetic inheritance impacts offspring\u2019s traits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">A recent study by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) found that epigenetic markers appear to be shared within ethnic groups.[5] The study\u2019s significance lies in the fact that, according to co-author Esteban Burchard, MD, MPH of UCSF, \u201cthis is the first time anyone has attempted to quantify the molecular signature of the non-genetic components of race and ethnicity.\u201d The researchers indicated that further studies in the future could show that these shared epigenetics may be due to shared environmental experiences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">As findings emerge regarding ethnic factors and inheritance of various traits, some note that this information may fall victim to a eugenic concept that has been prominent at various times, especially during the early 20th century.[6] Eugenics involves the racist notion that certain populations, particularly non-whites, should not be allowed to produce offspring due to a perceived biological inferiority. The sociologist Maurizio Meloni remarked that \u201cepigenetics has the potential to advance social justice\u201d by focusing on limiting the negative environmental factors that create epigenetic harm, and that it \u201cis important to keep talking about these issues, before minority groups such as racists try to hijack epigenetics to further their cause.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The real impacts of epigenetic alterations may be demonstrated through ongoing instances. A recent New York Times </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/opinion/a-scar-on-the-chinese-soul.html?_r=0\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">article </span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">noted that scientists have questioned whether the \u201cpublic humiliation, political exile and starvation\u201d that occurred in China under Mao Zedong may have impacted younger generations\u2019 psyches through epigenetic inheritance. [3] Likewise, children of Holocaust survivors are more likely to experience stress-related illnesses, and their stress genes have shown epigenetic markers that are identical to markers on the genes of their parents who endured the Holocaust. [4]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> Ultimately, the new information from UCSF, and the growing field in general, indicates potential for a greater understanding of epigenetic factors that impact health within various populations. This research may prove useful to address widespread health challenges, and a constructive dialogue may circumvent a \u201chijacking\u201d by eugenicists. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Sources</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">[1] Uppsala Universitet. \u201cA new principle for epigenetic changes.\u201d ScienceDaily.

        "title": "The multi-functional protein kinases: ATM and ATR",
        "author": "Carly Cheung, Microbiology, \u201817",
        "date": "04/21/2017",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe goal of this paper is to portray the multifunctionality of proteins involved in the cell and how interconnected one process is to another, even though two processes appear to be unrelated. I am fascinated by the system of signal transduction in our cells and admire how elaborate and complicated the network is. This is best shown by examining the two proteins, ATM and ATR, that are known for their functions in cell cycle regulation and DNA break repair. The paper explores the changes in their transduction pathways seen in mammals with cancer, metabolic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1086\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase (PIKK) family members are important regulators of the cell cycle. All stages of the cell cycle\u2013inactivity (G0), growth (G1), DNA synthesis (S), preparation for mitosis (G2), mitosis (M), and cytokinesis\u2013are controlled by sensors that detect cues within the cell and messengers that pass on the signal (Bin-Bing, 2000). The transduced activities involve interactive gene regulations to relay a signal into an action. Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated Rad3-related (ATR) are both signal transducers in the PIKK family that detect DNA breaks in the cell. It is essential that a cell detects DNA breaks to arrest the cycle and repair the DNA before continuing. ATM and ATR, like other kinases, phosphorylate active sites of specific downstream kinases, triggering a cascade of subsequent protein phosphorylation. Activated proteins can turn the transcription of genes on and off, as well as upregulate and downregulate expression of those genes, allowing a cell to actively respond to a direct cue. Research has found that ATM and ATR play roles in both regulating the cell cycle and initiating repair pathways to respond to DNA breaks (Bin-Bing, 2000). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Double stranded breaks activate ATM to phosphorylate the active site of checkpoint 1 (chk1), which activates subsequent proteins to phosphorylate the final protein in the pathway: p53. The ATM/p53 pathway is present in all phases of the cell cycle, possibly to ensure constant maintenance of the cell\u2019s integrity. Experiments conducted by Espach and colleagues suggest that p53 protein is essential to ATM protein\u2019s function. More is known about ATM because of the large array of diseases that result from a mutated ATM gene, such as immunodeficiency diseases, cancer, metabolic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases (Bin-Bing, 2000). The onset of such diseases highlights ATM\u2019s critical role in homeostasis, cell cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patients either deficient in ATM, or possess a mutated ATM, display symptoms of metabolic syndrome such as insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">high levels of the lipids or lipid containing molecules, like cholesterol, low density lipopolysaccharides, and triglycerides (Espatch, 2015). These observations </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">suggest ATM plays a role in multiple cellular functions for stress regulation (Figure 1). Furthermore, scientists discovered that ATM is activated not only by double-stranded DNA breaks, but also by oxidative stress. ATM facilitates in reducing the stress with production of NADP+. \u00a0Mice with increased ATM activation due to oxidative stress switches the cell\u2019s glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the Pentose Phosphate Pathway. This pathway generates more nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+), a cofactor known for its function as a reducing agent to oxidized compounds. When ATM is deficient in mice, it results in the activation of proteins that protect the cell, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">VEGF\u2019s function is critical in blood vessel development and increases the transcription of myoglobin protein, which relieves stress by transferring oxygen to cells during exercise or other high stress situations</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> In addition, ATM\u2019s deficiency is also directly involved in generation of these symptoms, by overproduction of GLUT1 and JNK1. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GLUT1 promotes increased cell growth and the kinase JNK1 is involved in regulation of insulin signaling and fat production (Espatch, 2015). GLUT1 activates antioxidant responses as well as increases glucose uptake, ultimately contributing to an increase in insulin resistance. Interestingly, JNK1 phosphorylates the active site of a downstream protein that disrupts insulin signaling and acts as a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> transcription factor for lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that generates cholesterol. The outcome of increased JNK1 transcription is insulin resistance and a build-up of cholesterol in the arteries. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Further supporting the hypothesis that the negative effects seen are due to activation of JNK1 protein, mice deficient in JNK1 shows no signs of insulin resistance or obesity (Espatch, 2015). Mice that have lost one functional copy of ATM have elevated levels of cholesterol, low density lipopolysaccharides, and triglycerides. These discoveries opened up possible treatments for cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome by synthetically increasing the activity of ATM protein to decrease activity of JNK1 protein.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many cancer therapies build upon the idea of inhibiting the ATR/chk1 pathway in cancer cells. ATR responds to single-stranded DNA breaks and phosphorylates the active site of the chk1 protein. A cancer cell\u2019s inability to repair its DNA breaks results in discontinuation of its life cycle and a quick accumulation of un-replicable DNA. Acknowledging its irreversible fate, the cancer cell undergoes apoptosis by the signal of un-replicable DNA. In an experiment where The ATR gene in mice were mutated, decreased growth rate of fibrosarcoma was seen (Fokas, 2014). Normal tissues received little to no impact even over a longer period of time, because cancer cells seem to only have the ATR/chk1 pathway, and no ATM pathway. In addition, the greater tendency of cancer cells to accumulate DNA replication stress, due to their characteristic abnormal growth, contributes to a potential drug\u2019s specificity in targeting cancer cells instead of healthy cells (Fokas, 2014). When a drug inhibits the ATR/chk1 pathway in cancer cells and healthy cells, healthy cells remain viable because of their remaining functional ATM/p53 pathway, allowing the drug further specificity to target cancer cells (Durisova et al).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another therapeutic application of ATR inhibition drugs is to use them in concert with chemotherapy against oncogenes. One example is the chemotherapeutic antimetabolite drug, Germacitabines, which is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into the cell\u2019s genome during replication, thereby terminating replication (Fokas, 2014). However, this mechanism requires an initiation of DNA replication by the tumor cell, which contributes to the number of natural occurrence of DNA breaks. The replication stress is a signal that naturally activates ATR/chk1 pathway to fix DNA breaks in order to continue the cancer cell\u2019s life cycle. Therefore, this chemotherapeutic drug increases the function of ATR, promoting cell growth in tumor cells. However, when the antimetabolite is paired with ATR inhibition drugs to impair cancer cells\u2019 ability to repair its broken DNA, the cancer cell becomes more sensitive to chemotherapy antimetabolites\u2019 effects (Fokas, 2014). ATR inhibition drugs can enhance the efficiency of chemotherapy drugs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The proteins involved in the ATR/chk1 and ATM/chk1 pathways construct an elaborate signal transduction network, not only to regulate the cell cycle, but also to ensure that the cell responds to the environment in a flexible manner. Phenotypes of cells that lack or have mutated ATR and ATM proteins highlight the importance of precise protein functions in every step of a pathway. An array of symptoms seen in type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cancer, can be traced back to the dysfunction of each protein involved in transducing the signal. These discoveries provide evidence that mechanisms to decrease ATR and increase ATM would be effective therapeutic agents.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 1:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This diagram from Espach et. al. shows the many chemical pathways that ATM affects. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bin-Bing S.

The purpose of this review is to highlight how basic biology can translate into significant advancements in disease diagnosis. I hope that the reader will be intrigued by the new genetic technologies and will proceed onto reading the original research article using this review as a guide.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1489\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When cells die, they don\u2019t disappear without a trace. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a product of apoptosis that finds its way into our lymphatic system, blood, urine, and many other fluids [1]. In healthy individuals, cfDNA primarily originates from hematopoietic lineage cells, while patients with physiological conditions or diseases have elevated levels of cfDNA, supposedly from damaged tissues and organs [2].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The process of producing cfDNA starts with uncoiling the tightly packaged DNA complex, leaving regions unprotected by nucleosomes exposed to nuclease enzymes [3]. The DNA associated with nucleosomes and transcription factors is protected from enzymatic digestion and can safely finds its way into circulating fluids of the human body [4]. Distributions of DNA interacting proteins, sites for epigenetic regulation, accessibility of transcription factors, and exon-intron splicing regions on the DNA are not random and may provide valuable information about the unique control of cell-specific genome expression. Previous research has shown that spacing patterns between nucleosomes determine the expression of genes crucial for cell-specific development [5]. Thus, knowing the exact position of the regulatory factors in the genome can provide insightful information about what cell type is being analyzed.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle are now able to infer which tissue cfDNA came from by studying the associations of cfDNA with nucleosomes and patterns of fragmentation. This discovery was accomplished by analyzing the degree of DNA protection at the transcriptional start sites, which provides information about regulatory sequences that were active during transcription. Aligning the data from an unknown cfDNA to an existing genome-wide cfDNA database and identifying markers of cell-specific gene expression can determine cfDNA tissue-of-origin. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The main goal of this study was to identify cfDNA tissue-of-origin in cancer patients. \u00a0Cancer patients usually show significant enrichment of non-hematopoietic cfDNA, possibly due to active cell death in the affected tissues. To identify the cancerous organ, the researchers matched the nucleosome and transcription factor signatures of unknown cfDNA from stage IV cancer patients to a library of a previously characterized cancer genome. For example, the tissue sample from a patient with ductal carcinoma in situ</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (cancer of the milk duct in the breast) showed a high correlation with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MCF7, a metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cell line from the cancer genome library. Interestingly, the derived data from cfDNA studies consistently showed which organ was affected and matched the clinical diagnosis.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This discovery has a tremendous potential to become a minimally invasive \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d, which can replace high-risk testing interventions. Although nucleosome occupancy maps can point to damaged tissues in patients with metastatic cancer, limitations still exist. Patients with advanced cancer harbor copious amounts of cfDNA in their bloodstream, but it is still unknown if patients with developing stages of the disease have enough biological markers to make cfDNA testing effective in early diagnosis. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Today, diagnosis for fetal trisomy relies on genotyping the fetal DNA that is present in the mother\u2019s blood. Thanks to sequencing technology, this is currently the most minimally invasive testing compared to directly drawing fluid from the amniotic sac [6]. The success rate of accurately sequencing the fetal DNA may be limited by the levels of fetal DNA present in the mother\u2019s bloodstream. This complication may be resolved by studying fetal cfDNA association with nucleosomes, which is a \u2018genotype-independent\u2019 technique.

My interests in social history and the genetics of disease inspired me to read Siddhartha Mukherjee\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gene: An Intimate History</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The following book review of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gene</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is intended for undergraduate biology majors at UC Davis and beyond. I wrote this review to persuade my peers of the book\u2019s instructional and thought-provoking value. My hope, too, is that readers of this review are encouraged by the pursuit of knowledge presented in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gene</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2019s stories</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to transform their passion for science into future innovations.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1590\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It has puzzled the world\u2019s greatest minds \u2013 from Aristotle and Plato to Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel \u2013 and dramatically altered the course of science and human history. Its discovery opened the door for unparalleled innovation in all fields of biology, evolution more than any other. Today, it feeds us with growing curiosity and optimism about the promising future of health and medicine. I am, of course, referring to the gene, the unit of hereditary information that directs reproduction, development, and our cells\u2019 everyday activities. The quest to understand the gene and its inner workings is fundamentally a quest to understand ourselves \u2013 and everything that makes us who we are. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee, assistant professor of medicine and cancer physician at Columbia University, remarkably tackles this challenge in his influential book, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gene: An Intimate History</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, published in 2016. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gene </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">follows Mukherjee\u2019s first book, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which presents a groundbreaking understanding of cancer and the mechanisms that cause it. In his second book, woven into Mukherjee\u2019s story about genetics and heredity is a chilling history of scientific influence on social movements. Throughout </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gene</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Mukherjee situates a potent personal narrative about mental illness as his motivation for writing this book. He is on a journey towards understanding his family\u2019s own genetic history, riddled with \u201cvarious unravelings of the mind.\u201d Undergraduate students majoring in biology should read Mukherjee\u2019s book because it serves as a compelling, persuasive reminder of the gene\u2019s foundational nature in biology and of the power that science holds to achieve both good and bad.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gene </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is divided into five parts of approximately equal length, but half of the book\u2019s content is devoted to a discussion of the future of genetics. The first three parts of the book describe the fundamental scientific findings of genetics. The book begins with Pythagoras, who in the sixth century B.C. developed the first theory to describe inheritance. Pythagoras\u2019 theory was, unsurprisingly, a male-centered view of heredity. Aristotle, to his credit, suggested that women as well as men contributed to the heredity of their offspring. Invisible to the world of science, the gene eluded discovery for over two thousand years until Mendel\u2019s pea plants finally revealed nature\u2019s little secret\u2014the transfer of genetic information contained in genes from generation to generation. Mendel\u2019s findings were the missing piece in Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, but were otherwise lost on the public\u2019s eyes and ears until nearly fifty years later. The rediscovery of Mendel spurred a renaissance in biology and the study of the gene, as Thomas Morgan\u2019s fruit fly experiments; Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, and Francis Crick\u2019s discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix structure; and the Human Genome Project all followed during \u201cthe century of the gene.\u201d Over time, molded to fit political and religious ideologies by a society struggling to understand the science of itself, these advancements were used to justify some of the darkest events in all of human history \u2013 from the American eugenics movement, which claimed Carrie Buck as its first victim of state-sponsored sterilization, to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The second half of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gene </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">confronts the questions of our time, evaluating the interactions of genetics with race, sexuality, faith, intelligence, character, and ethics. Should we use genetic technologies in the treatment of disease if it means understanding our code and then altering it? Where do we draw the line between improving society with science and campaigning for an unattainable perfection? After all, the mechanism of evolution by natural selection relies on differences \u2013 on variability in genotype and diversity in phenotype. Is our genetic code meant to be tampered with before we fully understand the effects of our actions? These unanswered questions are addressed by Mukherjee\u2019s analysis of genetics throughout. Mukherjee does not back down from a discussion on issues of bioethics, a topic very few are willing to cover with the level of breadth that he does in the book.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The value of Mukherjee\u2019s unique narrative can be truly discovered in its ability to endow a discussion of genetics with a level of personality often absent from this type of genre. Two of Mukherjee\u2019s uncles suffered from mental illnesses, one from schizophrenia and the other from bipolar disorder, which led to their premature demise. In his study of genetics, Mukherjee realizes that a portion of the genetic information that generated mental illness in his relatives might be an intrinsic characteristic within himself. Mukherjee\u2019s realization adds to the book a degree of emotion that reminds its readers of the proximity of genetics to their own lives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For undergraduate biology students, a group to which I belong, this book provides readers with a quick guide to college-level genetics. Indeed, instructors of genetics courses employ this book in their teaching, despite its unconventional narrative approach to science instruction. To characterize the book as a textbook-like summary of scientific research in my review, however, would be massively unfair to Mukherjee\u2019s efforts. Mukherjee bestows the most influential geneticists of all time with character, describing in detail their flaws and their failures, not just their scientific successes. Along the way, we see how geneticists, some with good intentions, have elevated certain aspects of their findings to promote ghastly technologies. It\u2019s a cautionary tale: genetics has immense potential to improve the world, but in our efforts towards improvement we might shift the trajectory of humans in unexpected ways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anyone can summarize the history of genetics; open any introductory university-level textbook on genetics and the contents will be filled with a discussion of scientific findings from Mendel, Darwin, Morgan, and the motley crew. What Mukherjee does so poignantly is address the applications of genetics to the future of humanity, discussing unique questions that we will grapple with in cell biology, evolution and ecology, and health and medicine for decades to come. This makes it an extremely worthwhile read for undergraduate biology students, who will be contending with the implications of cutting-edge genetic technologies for the entirety of their careers in science.</span></p>\n</div>"

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4> At the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting this year, I had the opportunity to listen to Dr. Pablo Ross from UC Davis present in a panel discussion on gene editing to create xenogeneic organs. I wrote this article to highlight interesting research that is being done by researchers around the country and right here at UC Davis. I hope that this article will explain xenogeneic organ production\u2014a revolutionary development in the future of medicine\u2014and push readers to think about related bioethical issues and future directions. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1622\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The idea of replacing one of your organs with an organ from a pig probably doesn\u2019t sound too appealing. But, for the twenty people that die every day in the US from end stage organ failure, organs from animals could save their lives. Currently there is a huge organ shortage in the United States. Over a hundred thousand patients are already on waiting lists for an organ transplant, prompting many researchers to look for a solution.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On Feb. 18, Dr. Pablo Ross, an associate professor of animal science at UC Davis, presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) conference in Austin, Texas. Scientists like Dr. Ross are researching how to make xenogeneic organs for human transplant. Xenogeneic organ production is similar to xenotransplantation, a process in which an organ or tissue from an animal is transplanted into a human. Human cells are injected into a pig embryo, where they develop into a full-sized organ after about six months. Then the organ is harvested and transplanted into a human patient. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the biggest issues with organ transplants is organ rejection, which occurs when a patient has an immune response to the organ. Novel stem-cell based therapeutics using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a type of genetically-engineered stem cell capable of becoming nearly any cell in the human body, may provide a solution to this problem. Using iPSCs creates a xenogeneic organ that is composed of human cells but still has the same size and shape as the organ in the host species. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to grow a human organ inside a pig,\u201d Dr. Ross explained at a press briefing at the 2018 AAAS meeting. \u201cWe expect to grow a pig organ full of human cells.\u201d Researchers hope that using human iPSCs will reduce the risk of organ rejection, rendering xenogeneic organ transplants a viable option.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To reduce immune rejection even further, Dr. Hiromitsu Nakauchi, a professor and researcher at Stanford University, hopes to develop patient-specific organs by blastocyst complementation. This method involves injecting human iPSCs from the patient into a blastocyst\u2014 a structure present in early embryonic development in mammals\u2014 from the organ donor species. This produces an organ made of the patient\u2019s own cells. The aim of this method is to allow the patient\u2019s immune system to recognize the transplant organ as \u201cself,\u201d minimizing the risk of immune rejection. \u201c[Inter-species blastocyst complementation] would solve two of the main issues of organ transplantation: source of organs and potential for immune rejection,\u201d explained Dr. Ross. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most prominent bioethical concerns regarding xenogeneic organ production, however, is whether human iPSCs migrate to other tissues in the donor animal. Human iPSCs could potentially embed in tissues like the brain or gonads, which could raise bioethical concerns about \u201chumanization\u201d of the host animal. However, Dr. Nakauchi proposed using livestock animals, which are less genetically similar to humans, instead of non-human primates to decrease this risk. This makes livestock animals more ethical host species for xenogeneic organic production.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although these recent breakthroughs are promising, further research must be done before xenogeneic organs are a viable solution to the organ shortage problem. \u201cWe need to come up with different strategies to increase the efficiency of these </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">human-porcine chimeric embryos,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Garry, a professor of medicine at the Lillehei Heart Institute, in his presentation during the session at AAAS. Discoveries like blastocyst complementation bring us one step closer to solving the organ shortage problem; however, before xenogeneic organ transplants become common in hospitals, researchers must streamline the process, address bioethical concerns, and minimize the risk of immune rejection. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sources:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Garry, D., Ross, P. and Nakauchi, H.

        "title": "Could a DNA Sample Reconstruct a Face?",
        "author": "Anna Kirillova, Cell Biology, \u201919",
        "date": "06/30/2018",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Author\u2019s Note: I came across facial genetics in one of my classes and immediately decided to write a review about it. To my surprise, the field was not as developed as I\u2019ve expected it to be, but with the rise of facial recognition technologies, this area of research will be growing in the near future. In this review, I explained basic concepts and recent advancements in the field of human facial genetics. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1685\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is it possible to reconstruct one\u2019s facial structure from a DNA sample using our profound understanding of genetics and genomics? Although we know the code of our DNA, many factors that determine human facial structure still remain unknown and a fascinating topic to many researchers. Scientists now understand that craniofacial genetic information is highly heritable and may be predicted if other components such as sex, genotype, and associated disease alleles are known. Even though genetic information is variable and complex, some rare gene variations, particularly ones associated with ethnicity or disease, may be the key determining factors of facial morphology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Surprisingly, major contributors to our facial structure are located in genes that seem to be unrelated to how we look. Each candidate point mutation in a gene, or single nucleotide variant (SNP), may be correlated to a phenotype of interest using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). With GWAS, researchers have been able to identify a subset of rare genetic mutations related to metabolism, growth and disease that significantly affect the facial structure. Specifically, Down Syndrome, Jackson-Weiss Syndrome and Soto Syndrome are genetic disorders that result in physiological, mental and craniofacial abnormalities. Other examples include the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">IRF6</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> gene, which is involved in cytokine signaling and keratinocyte development. Pathogenic SNPs in this gene can cause congenital cleft lip syndrome, a facial condition where the splitting of the lip extends to the nose. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, specific genes that are seemingly unrelated to facial structure, such as hormone receptor gene </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GHR</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and enzyme-encoding gene </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ENPP1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, have recently been identified as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">determining factors of jawbone shape and facial length in Asian populations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Apart from rare mutations of large effect, our phenotype is mostly determined by many common variations. A common variation may be present in many individuals in a population and usually does not cause disease or any significant change to the overall phenotype by itself. On the other hand, accumulation of these common variations may produce an additive effect and drastically change the phenotype. Due to the high density and subtle effects of common variations, it is extremely difficult to narrow down specific alleles responsible for facial structure. However, some large-scale studies have been able to identify 5 common loci that significantly influence nose shape variations in Europeans, paving the way for further investigation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A recent study developed a high-density 3D facial evaluation, where fine resolution images were obtained from a cohort of diverse individuals to identify significant associations between SNPs and variations in their facial structure. Coupling this data to self-reported sex, genomic ancestry, and genotype, the study has uncovered 24 new candidate SNPs in 20 genes associated with craniofacial development. In addition, the researchers developed an algorithm that quantifies parameters such as distance between nose, lips, eyes and degrees of curvature from a 3D facial image. This method is now able to make a rough sketch of one\u2019s \u00a0facial structure based on the presence of specific SNPs and additional determining factors. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So could a DNA sample reconstruct a face? Not quite to the level of precision as we would like! Although using GWAS and new 3D resolution technologies makes it possible to recreate general facial features like eye color, hair color, age, and one\u2019s ancestry, it is clear that more research is necessary to improve our prediction strategies. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Peng S et al.

We were required to write a review article on a topic of our choice, and I chose the relationship between genetic diversity and disturbance of <i>Zostera marina</i>. I decided to pursue this topic because I was concurrently working in a molecular ecology eelgrass lab on campus, and I believed to get the most out of this lab experience I should have a good grasp of the current research that is already published and what still needs to be published within the subject. I hope this review gives readers a better understanding of where we now stand in eelgrass molecular ecology research, just as it did for myself.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1697\"></span><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p>Environmental disturbance is an expected function of all ecosystems and has been known to influence community structure and dynamics. Considerable research has drawn conclusions about the effects that diversity has on disturbance response in the eelgrass species <i>Zostera marina</i>. Studies have shown a positive effect of genetic diversity on disturbance response, in both grazing and temperature disturbance experiments. This review gives background information on this relationship and synthesizes the previous knowledge of diversity on disturbance response in eelgrass communities. Studies looking at the reverse of this relationship, disturbance effects on diversity, are mentioned; however the research is insufficient and lacking. With disturbance frequency expecting to rise in the future, understanding how disturbance influences the patterns and distribution of genetic diversity is essential to maintaining the biodiversity of <i>Z. marina. </i>This review concludes with key questions that remain before we can fully understand the association between disturbance and genetic diversity in the eelgrass species <i>Z. marina. </i></p>\n<p>Keywords: <i>genetic diversity; disturbance; eelgrass; seagrass; disturbance response; Zostera marina</i></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p>Seagrass is a foundation species that provides many benefits to both humans and coastal ecosystems. A dominant seagrass species is the eelgrass <i>Zostera marina</i>, which, as an ecosystem engineer, contributes largely to nutrient cycling, habitat provision, and primary productivity [1]. With some of the most productive marine plant communities being species poor, including seagrass, and with anthropomorphic disturbances expected to increase, it is important to understand the effects that these circumstances will have on the genetic diversity of foundation species such as <i>Z. marina </i>[2]. There has been significant research showing the positive effects of genetic diversity on eelgrass disturbance response, highlighting how important this diversity will be with increasing disturbance due to climate change [8]. However, there has been little research on the influence of disturbance on genetic diversity. This paper will outline the previous research published regarding the benefits of genetic diversity on disturbance response and will offer ideas for future research in the hopes of filling in gaps in our understanding of disturbance on genetic diversity of the eelgrass species.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Background</h4></p>\n<p>Ecological disturbance can be understood as any event that disrupts ecosystem community, affects population structure, changes resources, or alters the physical environment [9]. These ecological disturbances, which are inevitable features of nature, can have sizable impacts on ecosystem dynamics and structure. In 1979, Wayne Sousa sought to understand ecological disturbance through a manipulated experiment. Sousa looked at algal succession on boulders, assuming the smaller the boulder, the more disturbance it would experience due to incoming waves. The results showed that the frequency at which the rock was overturned was correlated with the difference in species composition. In other words, the amount of disturbance received was responsible for the difference in the algal species diversity [7]. This finding is helpful information, but with many marine plant communities being species limited, it is more important to know about the relationship between disturbance and diversity on the genetic level [6].</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Effects of Genetic Diversity on Temperature Disturbance Response</h4></p>\n<p>A clear correlation can be seen between genetic diversity of eelgrass and disturbance response. Thorsten Reusch set up a manipulated experiment recording shoot density of <i>Z. marina</i> with plots of four different genotypic variation [6]. When a heat wave came to the area where the plots were planted, the plots with higher genetic diversity responded better to the disturbance, showing increased levels of total shoot count and biomass. Following up this study, Reusch designed a new experiment again testing the effects of genetic diversity on temperature disturbance response. Since the first experiment\u2019s disturbance was natural, this study would be the first of its kind to conduct a simulated heat wave on eelgrass to see if genetic diversity could buffer the losses due to heat. The results showed both that the warming had a negative impact on the shoot density and that the more genetically diverse plots responded better to this disturbance [1]. Both of these studies build off of each other to show the benefits that genetic diversity of eelgrass species can have to rising sea water temperatures. This is significant research, with a recent study detecting an acceleration of sea surface temperature rise during the 20th century [10]. As temperatures continue to rise, understanding the benefits that genetic diversity can have on the response to thermal disturbance will be essential in future policy decisions for eelgrass communities and coastal ecosystems.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Effects of Genetic Diversity on Grazing Disturbance Response</h4></p>\n<p>On a different spectrum of disturbance, grazing is also a common impact that negatively affects eelgrass communities. Knowing the ecosystem services provided by <i>Z. marina</i>, it is important that we also understand the effects of genetic diversity on herbivory response. Randall Hughes and John Stachowicz aimed to do so by planting four different diversity treatments: one, two, four, and eight genotypes, and recording shoot density as a measure of ecosystem function over a ten-month period. The grazing disturbance was due to Brant Geese, and the experiment showed similar results to that of the temperature disturbance experiments. There was no effect of genetic diversity on shoot density prior to the disturbance, but following the grazing event, a greater shoot density was found among the plots with higher genetic diversity [4]. In 2011, Hughes and Stachowicz wanted to test the effects of genetic diversity of eelgrass as a response to disturbance over a short period of time with a controlled disturbance, and over a long period of time with a natural disturbance. The controlled disturbance was achieved through clipping the shoots and the natural disturbance was due to a bloom of macro algae that caused a significant amount of shoot loss in the eelgrass beds. With regards to the experimental disturbance, diversity effects were shown in disturbance resilience (measured as shoot-regrowth) following the experiment. The polycultures showed greater increases in shoot density than expected at the highest level of disturbance. When observing the results of the natural disturbance, researchers found that the polycultures lost less biomass than the monocultures [5]. With increasing human disturbances leading to a loss of eelgrass diversity, these studies show the importance of preserving their genetic diversity if humans want to continually benefit from the species [4].</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Effects of Disturbance on Genetic Diversity</h4></p>\n<p>While the benefits were observed of genetic diversity on disturbance response, Reusch was the first to study the inverse of this relationship in 2006. Reusch wanted to test three things: whether the physical disturbance would increase the genotypic diversity of <i>Z. marina</i> through an increased number of sexual recruits, if changes in genotypic diversity depend on the intensity of the physical disturbance, and whether disturbance would cause less competitive genotypes to be released from competition. The vegetation removal (disturbance) was controlled and the genotypic composition was monitored for two years. The results showed more sexual recruitment (represented by more shoots with new genotypes) and increased genet dynamics (represented by increased change in genotypic diversity) [11]. These results could be explained by the disturbance clearing neighboring shoots, allowing for less competition and more sunlight for the new seedlings and eventually more genotypes in the eelgrass bed. Recently, however, a study by Randall Hughes looked at the influence of genetic diversity on seedling biomass in the eelgrass species <i>Z. marina.</i> The results proved similar to Reusch\u2019s, but without any manipulated disturbance. The seedlings from the polycultures had larger shoots compared to the seedlings from the monoculture [3]. This finding diminishes the importance of the results to the Reusch study, showing that even without disturbance there may be more sexual recruitment due to higher genetic diversity. With Reusch\u2019s results now not completely understood, it is even more vital that we spend more energy and resources on this relationship between disturbance on genetic diversity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Outstanding Questions</h4></p>\n<p>As stressed above, there have been years of research completed about the effects of genetic diversity on disturbance response in <i>Z. marina</i>, but there is still research yet to be pursued about how disturbance influences their genetic diversity. We have evidence from Reusch\u2019s 2006 paper that disturbance may increase genotypic diversity, but with the latest results of the Hughes study, more work needs to be done [3]. We have yet to test many variables: repeated disturbance, different intensities of disturbance, natural disturbance, long-term disturbance, multiple disturbances, and so on. In addition, we know that grazing disturbance decreases the competition above ground, and we should attempt to understand how the competition below ground is affected and its impact on genotypic diversity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p>Disturbance is an important ecological process, but its effect on eelgrass diversity is relatively unknown. Recent research shows the possible influences disturbance may have on seedling recruitment, which leads to genotypic diversity, but there is much more to be studied about this association. Once more is cumulatively understood and tested, we will have a better idea of how to prepare for forthcoming disturbances and plan mitigation strategies for eelgrass communities.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Works Cited</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reusch, T.B.H., Ehlers, A., Haemmerli, A. &amp; Worm, B.

One such disease, cystic fibrosis, serves as an excellent window into the field of personalized medicine. The following review article examines the current state of cystic fibrosis research, in the process detailing recent studies on the correlations, or lack thereof, between mutant genotypes and disease phenotypes. Knowledge of these relationships is incomplete, necessitating the need for further patient population studies and drug treatment tests. Toward the end of the article, studies on the effects of certain cystic fibrosis drugs currently in the pipeline are presented. With future findings, clinical treatment of cystic fibrosis can be significantly improved by our foundational understanding of the effects of personalized medicine on the individual. Treatments targeting cystic fibrosis genotypes are a promising alternative to the existing and often unsuccessful clinical methodologies, which place an emphasis on the symptoms of the disease.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Keywords: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: italic;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">personalized medicine; precision medicine; cystic fibrosis (CF); cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene; Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) database; </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: Symbol;color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: italic;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">\u0394</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: italic;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">F</span><span style=\"font-size: 7.199999999999998pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: italic;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: sub\">508</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: italic;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\"> mutations; rare mutations (RMs).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Introduction</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Cystic fibrosis\u2014a genetically-inherited, life-threatening condition that infects the lungs, the respiratory system, and the digestive system\u2014affects over seventy thousand people worldwide according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (1). The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which controls the expression of chloride and bicarbonate ion channels in the plasma membrane of respiratory and epithelial cells (2). An imbalance in the number of ion channels or a decrease in the probability of open channels triggers several physiological issues, including mucus buildup, inflammation of lung tissue, and bacterial infection (2, 3).

Pancreatic insufficiency as related to the progression of cystic fibrosis seems to be dependent on genotype (5). The severity of cystic fibrosis symptoms is markedly higher for pancreatic-insufficient patients, and those with pancreatic insufficiency typically have severe CFTR mutations on both alleles (5). </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Additional support for this correlational hypothesis is provided by existing research. Classifications of high-risk and low-risk genotypes, if properly assigned through an evaluation of phenotypic disease severity and protein production levels, are a useful tool for predicting disease progression (8, 9). Ninety-three percent of individuals with CFTR mutations recorded in the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) patient registry were classified as having a high-risk genotype. These individuals with a high-risk genotype were 2.25 times less likely to survive than the seven percent of individuals with a low-risk genotype (8). In a further exploration of the data available from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, patient survival was correlated with sweat chloride concentrations and again with genotypic-risk groups: as sweat chloride concentration and risk group of the genotype increased, survival decreased (9). Patients with at least partially functional CFTR proteins experienced prolonged survival in comparison to those with fully non-functional CFTR proteins (9). In several studies, effects of phenotypic factors on survival were shown to be statistically insignificant, linking defective genotypes directly to disease severity and transforming gene sequences into a reliable forecaster of survival likelihood (3, 7, 8).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">However, current consensus on the correlational hypothesis is limited by a lack of genetic data from patients with unidentified or rare CFTR mutations. Information on rare mutations (RMs) is absent from the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) database, which catalogues the currently-known CFTR mutations and reports associations between the mutations and corresponding phenotypes (6). This lack of data presents medicine with challenges when trying to diagnose and treat patients whose gene sequences include RMs. Additionally, the range of disease-related symptoms seen in patients with cystic fibrosis cannot be explained simply by mutations in the CFTR gene (2, 6, 10, 11, 12). In the following section, alternative correlational factors and diagnostic methods are discussed. These variables could potentially prove to be more reliable predictors of disease diagnosis and progression, or explain more fully the mechanisms behind genotype-to-phenotype relationships.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Genetic Modifiers, Environmental Variables, and Other Factors</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Genotyping of CFTR sequences in the cystic fibrosis gene locus is certainly not the only clinical method of disease diagnosis. As a result of the incomplete data described above, research has suggested that sweat chloride concentration and nasal potential difference measurements are more effective tools in clinical diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (6, 13). Arguably, a number of phenotypic factors might influence the responses of individual patients to certain CFTR mutation-specific therapies. The effects of CFTR mutations can be noticed at any age in varying degrees of intensity: for any given age and genetic background, phenotypes can vary (5). While many studies take exhaustive steps to ensure that differing levels of disease severity are indeed caused by genetic variation, there exist significant limitations to research that makes conclusions in favor of direct genotype-to-phenotype correlations (at least in the context previously discussed). Environmental variables, such as poor nutrition, might very well affect pancreatic insufficiency, just as the variability in pulmonary function likely affects the severity of cystic fibrosis disease symptoms (5, 6).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">In addition to the above-mentioned phenotypic symptoms of cystic fibrosis, genetic modifiers are a potential explanation for how the same clinical treatment can induce different reactions from individuals with the same CFTR mutations (2). An assessment of the Canadian cystic fibrosis population analyzed the pleiotropic effects of genetic modifiers on patient survival and disease prognosis (12). Pleiotropic modifiers make a complete understanding of the complex relationships between cystic fibrosis genotype and phenotype difficult to achieve (12). Further research demonstrates the role that multiple modifier gene loci play in the severity of cystic fibrosis-related lung disease (10). The complications caused by these genetic modifiers create significant obstacles in the process of formulating correlations between genotype and phenotype. The resulting deficit in molecular and mechanical understanding necessitates further research, the specifics of which are elucidated in the next section. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Recent and Future Developments of Personalized Medicine</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Future progress in personalized medicine requires from the field of cystic fibrosis research the development of effective models and the experimental evaluation of novel cystic fibrosis treatments. Many of the current treatments for cystic fibrosis, including antibiotics for lung infections and mucociliary clearance (MCC), inadequately slow the development of the disease and only marginally improve the likelihood of surviving longer (2). The following section will highlight current research and recommended strategies to direct the field of cystic fibrosis closer to clinically successful diagnostic approaches and treatment methods.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Additional research and mutation-cataloguing is needed to strengthen the quality of clinical diagnoses. Genetic analysis loses its value in diagnosing cystic fibrosis if identified rare mutations are uncharacterized by CFTR databases (14). To improve the cataloguing of rare mutations in CFTR databases, centers for cystic fibrosis should continue to record this data (6). To understand the disease-causing potential of rare mutations, data must also be catalogued from a larger population. This is the current aim of the developing CFTR3 database (6).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Much of the current cystic fibrosis research concerns the evaluation of pharmaceutical treatments for the disease.

The study established a methodology for testing the effect of a mutation by using the ratio of CFTR-dependent \u201cC-sweat\u201d secreted from an individual to CFTR-independent \u201cM-sweat\u201d secreted from that same individual (3). To record sweat ratios, CFTR-independent M-sweating was induced with methacholine and then experimentally inhibited, triggering the production of CFTR-dependent C-sweating (3). Usually, sweat-chloride concentration tests are unreliable indicators of functioning CFTR levels, but C-sweat/M-sweat testing allows for the control of variations in sweat volume between two patients, eliminating some of the variables encountered in the previous section (3). Since the process that generates C-sweat is dependent on the functionality of CFTR, greater C-sweat/M-sweat ratios can be interpreted to indicate that the CFTR protein was functioning at a higher level (3). The presence of ivacaftor prompted larger sweat ratios (3). Therefore, ivacaftor is considered a useful treatment for certain CFTR mutations. Other pharmaceutical drugs are currently undergoing development, including some that have progressed to clinical trials (2). </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">The mechanisms behind genetic modifiers and their influence on disease intensity is not yet fully understood, so these pathways have not been utilized in pharmaceutical medicine to date.

In vitro assays are also useful, but must consider the typical internal environment in lungs afflicted with cystic fibrosis, incorporating this into the experimental design (2). A greater depth of in vivo and in vitro research is required to develop an ideal personalized medicine model for patients, one that eases the phenotypic effects of cystic fibrosis mutations by targeting the CFTR gene sequence, or corresponding protein, itself.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Conclusion</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">With these recent findings in mind, the most effective personalized medicine method in practice is likely a synthesis of various gene therapies and different treatments that target physiological symptoms of disease. Based on the current body of research, it is widely understood and accepted that cystic fibrosis phenotypes are influenced by CFTR mutations, but in what way and to what extent remains unclear. Furthermore, disease phenotypes cannot be explained simply as a result of CFTR mutations. Before drawing experimental conclusions or designing clinical methods for treatment, any well-rounded and complete analysis of disease severity should consider genetic modifiers, environmental variables, and the effects of other phenotypic factors. On a larger scale, the correlations between genotype and phenotype described throughout this literature review seem to accurately predict population dynamics, but until further genetic analyses, clinical experiments, and pharmaceutical research can be completed, the present state of cystic fibrosis research advises against the specific diagnosis of an individual on the basis of genotype-to-phenotype correlations.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><h4></h4></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.8;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Works Cited</span></p>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: decimal;font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline;text-align: left\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.7999999999999998;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 0pt;text-align: justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;font-family: 'Times New Roman';color: #000000;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">About Cystic Fibrosis [Internet]. 2017.

        "date": "11/10/2018",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Author\u2019s Note: I chose to interview Dr.LaSalle because of my interest in epigenetics and the relationship that our genes have with environmental interactions. Dr. LaSalle\u2019s lab focuses on the role of epigenetics in the human autism-spectrum and many other neurodegenerative disorders. Her research group looks at the pathogenesis of the disorders by focusing on heritable changes that are not encoded in the DNA, such as DNA methylation and imprinted genes. It was an honor to get to talk to Dr. LaSalle about her research, as she is extremely passionate about this very complex and exciting topic.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1738\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Mh</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> What first got you interested in the research you do today?</span></p>\n<p><h4>Js</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My lab studies epigenetics and gene environment interaction, a topic I find of great interest because genetics is never completely deterministic. I started out with my PhD in Immunology, and then in my post-doctoral fellowship, I studied epigenetics of imprinted disorders, which do not fit Mendelian genetics. More recently, my lab has gotten into sequencing technology, as we are interested in the interface of gene-environment interactions at the epigenetics level. With this, we can use the sequencing technology to predict who might get a disease in the future.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mh</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> You do research with genomic imprinting and DNA Methylation. Can you talk a bit about what that means and how it is used to understand how gene and environment interactions affect us?</span></p>\n<p><h4>Js</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> DNA methylation seems to be perceived as an off switch for genes, but the revised way of seeing it is as a mark of past transcription, which gives clues for future transcription. We know that genes are methylated at the earliest stages of life, specifically during embryonic development. Differences in methylation can indicate previous transcription activity. An example of this is autism, where most of the environmental factors occur </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in utero.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> These changes cannot be sampled directly before birth. We can resort to sampling placenta or cord blood, which can give an idea of the changes that occurred before birth. I think of methylation as mining for clues, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to find genes that are turned off by methylation.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mh</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Do you find when looking at DNA methylation, evidence of environmental impact on methylation that is not encoded in the gene?</span></p>\n<p><h4>Js</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> That is our eventual goal. There are good examples of this, such as imprinted genes in oocytes or sperm. Oocytes may have certain transcripts that will be methylated on the maternal but not paternal chromosome, which is affected by the environment. The goal is to find other environmental exposures such as diet, etc. Folate is an important diet factor in methylation and can be found in prenatal vitamins, such as Vitamin B. Women are encouraged to take prenatal vitamins prior to pregnancy as it is protective for neural tube defects, autism, and schizophrenia.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mh</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> What creates the spectrum in Autism Spectrum Disorder?</span></p>\n<p><h4>Js</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Autism has a wide spectrum of diagnoses and a single gene only makes about 1 percent of cases. One of the disorders that we research is Rett Syndrome, a rare genetic form of autism. I find it interesting how there is a spectrum within the cognition and severity of symptoms. There is a range of disease severity ranging from someone who has high functioning Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, all the way down to someone who is nonverbal and may have an intellectual disability. This is where the gene environment interaction may come in. Genetically, you could say that one gene mutation is enough to cause autism, yet in a lot of cases the cause could be completely environmental. It is mostly a combination of multiple hits, common genetic variance combined together with environmental factors. Our goal is to be able to provide a diagnosis based on a common epigenetic modification. With that, we could provide children with behavioral therapies to help them improve their skills since the brain is still very plastic. Even if a child is genetically predisposed to autism, interventions can improve the outcomes, which is pretty amazing.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mh</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> How have you seen epigenetics change the healthcare field?</span></p>\n<p><h4>Js</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Epigenetics is changing the healthcare field by escaping the conventional genetic determinism. Personal genomics ideas, like 23andMe, are great, but most people are at risks for common disorders like obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. Epigenetics is so powerful because we can change one\u2019s lifestyle to lower the risks of the disease. I think that prenatal vitamins use is a great example of this because it can serve as a preventative measure in patients with common polymorphisms. Ultimately, if one is at higher risk for a disease, they have to make your own decision in the modification of their lifestyle. I can see personal epigenetics combined with using epigenetic markers as a way to change the healthcare field.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mh</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Have you always been interested in the biotechnological side of research?</span></p>\n<p><h4>Js</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Great question. My generation would run sequencing gels and write out the base pairs by hand. The amount of data that we now are able to work with makes sequencing so important and exciting. Every time I turn around it is cheaper and faster to do. The challenge is that we get an immense amount of data that we have to handle. I do not know how to code myself, but many of my lab members have been able to pick it up. This is especially important in epigenetics because understanding what went into the biological sample is necessary to be able to analyze the data. My goal is to train students who are comfortable in both the science and the bioinformatics side. I think we really need the new generation of scientists feel comfortable with big data.</span></p>\n</div>"

        "title": "Cultured Meat: Teaching an Old Cell New Tricks",
        "author": "Tannavee Kumar, Genetics and Genomics \u201820",
        "date": "01/25/2019",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultured meat has been a topic of great discussion as we try to understand the extent to which animal agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental issues. While plant-based imitation meats have been on the market for decades, I was particularly interested in this lab-grown alternative when I heard that stem cells were being used to produce actual meat without having to raise animals themselves. This could potentially reduce the environmental footprint of the agricultural industry while providing a viable solution for consumers. While it is critical to understand how consumption levels of animal-based products have had an effect on health, and particularly how the change in consumption of these products have changed average human health, my research focused more on how traditional meat impacts environmental health and how cultured meat can help mitigate some of these problems. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1791\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Trends in Meat Consumption</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Animals used for meat and other foods were first domesticated between 15,000 and 5,000 years ago [1,2] when this practice evolved into animal agriculture. The shift from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to an agricultural one meant a steady and growing food supply. The increase in wealth, which fuels factory farming, usage of fertilizers, and technological and genetic advancements, have expanded food availability across various regions around the world, thus increasing consumption [3]. In the Mediterranean, mean availability of animal products such as meats, animal fats, fish and seafood increased from 268.4 kilocalories per person per day during the period of 1961-1965 to 531.1 kilocalories per person per day during the 2000-2004 period; similar trends were also seen for Northern and Central Europe [4]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since 1963, consumption has been on the rise by a considerable 62 percent throughout the world, with the strongest increase in developed nations. In general, countries like the United Kingdom and United States were found to primarily source pigs, sheep, and cattle. Developing regions like the Middle East, Africa, and India mainly produced goat and camel meats; however, non-animal-based sources of protein were still found to be dominant [3]. Countries such as China and Brazil that have enjoyed economic growth also show ninefold and threefold increases, respectively, in meat consumption including cattle since 1963. Thus, researchers have found a strong correlation between economic growth and increased meat intake. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">John Kearney at the Dublin Institute for Technology expects food consumption to be on the rise through 2050 and claims trends show that meat will be no different. The major drivers of this forecast are food availability, accessibility, and choice. Disposable income, urbanization, globalization, marketing, religion, culture, and consumer attitudes are all causes of such drivers. After 1.7 billion livestock are raised, transported, and processed, 300 million tons of meat are produced every year [6,8]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Environmental Impact</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Increased consumption of animal-based products proves to have major environmental consequences due to its inefficient process. Meat production requires significant inputs of land, water, food, and energy to support multiple steps. The process begins with growing sufficient crops to feed livestock; an estimated 75 percent of the world\u2019s agricultural land goes into meat production [6]. In Central America alone, 40 percent of rainforest land has been cleared in the last 40 years for cattle pasture to meet the demands of the export market \u2014 often times the United States [7]. Furthermore, Harold Mooney from Stanford University\u2019s Woods Institute estimates that one-third of the world\u2019s total arable land is utilized to support livestock in some shape or form [8]. Over time, the land is depleted from wind and soil erosion caused by over-farming and overgrazing. The environmental costs do not end here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On average, one pound of meat requires between 5,000 and 20,000 liters of water for direct and indirect use [6,10]. In the United States, 25 trillion liters of water are used for animal feed alone [10]. After everything is processed, researchers have found that in the U.S. 40 percent of freshwater is deemed unfit for drinking or recreational use due to contamination by microorganisms, fertilizers, and pesticides. For example, total phosphorus excretions of many livestock are seven to nine times greater than that of humans, resulting in disastrous effects to surrounding ecosystems. Furthermore, runoff from manure fosters an ideal environment for a number of waterborne pathogens. Case studies in China, India, the U.S., and Denmark indicate that \u201canimal waste is a leading factor in pollution of land and water resources\u201d [11]. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) proliferate these issues as dense groups of livestock are raised in very confined conditions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that livestock, including poultry, accounts for 14.5 percent of anthropogenic (human-induced) greenhouse gas emissions. About 44 percent of the emissions are from methane, 29 percent from nitrous oxide, and 27 percent from carbon dioxide. Methane is 28 to 36 times more effective than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and nitrous oxide is 265 to 298 times more effective than carbon dioxide [8,14]. Research led by the University of Oxford and University of Amsterdam found that producing beef consumed the greatest amount of energy, land, and water, and it emitted the greatest amount of greenhouse gases relative to sheep, pork, and poultry. Concern is rising as the population is expected to reach 9.6 billion by 2050, causing many to consider solutions that can help mitigate and prevent the effects of animal agriculture. One such emerging solution is cultured meat, otherwise known as in vitro meat.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Cultured Meat, Myogenesis, and Choosing the Most Applicable Stem Cell</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultured meat, which goes by a variety of names \u2014 in vitro meat, synthetic meat, lab-grown meat \u2014 is meat that is grown from cell culture rather than a full-fledged animal. In Vitro Meat Production System (IMPS) utilizes the same protocol for tissue engineering techniques that are traditionally used in regenerative medicine. The first cultured burger made out of cow muscle was made by Mark Post in 2013 from Maastricht University in the Netherlands, with some modifications made since then. There are a number of ways to produce cultured meat such as the Self-organization technique, where muscle cells are maintained in vitro and nourished with the suitable nutrients, or the Scaffold-based technique, which utilizes stem cells that are allowed to be differentiated and grown into muscle tissue in vitro [19]. Initiating the Scaffold-based technique calls for the best possible stem cells to be utilized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At first, embryonic stem cells may seem to be the most obvious choice for IMPS, since they provide virtually unlimited regenerative potential. However, genetic mutations have proven to limit the \u201cproduction potential\u201d of an embryonic stem cell [19]. Once stimulated, these cells do not necessarily retain the same proliferative characteristics; therefore, it has not been possible to culture cells with \u201cinfinite self-renewal capacity\u201d [19]. The next option is myosatellite cells, also called satellite cells, which are found in muscle tissue that are repeatedly able to conduct the process of myogenesis, otherwise known as muscle generation, with \u201chigh efficacy.\u201d Moreover, satellite cells have been proven to be integral because they \u201cfulfill the criteria for a true somatic stem cell: self-renewal and the ability to generate progeny of several distinct cell types\u201d [18,19].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Isolation and Proliferation of Satellite Cells</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For the purposes of producing meat for edible consumption, researchers at various institutions have aimed to produce skeletal muscle. Satellite cells, which are found next to the muscle cells, are isolated from the animal following a biopsy [16,17]. In this step, a sample of skeletal muscle is collected from the organism and approximately 100 cells are isolated. Since these specific cells become activated in response to an injury or stress, they can be harnessed to grow muscle cells for consumption. Once isolated, proliferation can begin. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During proliferation, the goal is to produce as many satellite cells as possible in order to activate them to transition into myocytes or tubular muscle cells. A culture medium with the appropriate growth factor promotes the culturing of the stem cells. Generally, the medium is sourced from an adult, newborn, or foetus animal. The growth factor is made via muscle cells coupled with other cells types such as hepatocytes [18,19]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Differentiation, Fusion, Polishing, and the End Result</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To enter differentiation, a change in medium is required to meet the changing demands of the new cells [17,19]. Unfortunately, the medium contributes to the high expenditure required towards overall costs as it requires regular replenishing from Fetal Calf Serum, which often raises ethical concerns. Many question the ethics as the serum is sourced from calves, and each calf can only produce a relatively small amount. Alternatives like sphingosine 1-phosphate and amino-acid rich mushroom extracts have been suggested for the serum-based media to replace the Fetal Calf Serum [19]. Over time the satellite cells will become myoblasts, otherwise called activated satellite cells. With continuous replenishment of serum the myoblasts differentiate into myscotytes. These long tubular cells form muscles. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An edible or non-edible non-animal-based scaffold is used to help the cells attach to a surface. Additionally, a scaffold that imitates tissue-like flexibility and stiffness will mimic in vivo conditions the best. As the cells are allowed to contract, further differentiation can occur [19]. Polymers like collagen or cellulose have been suggested as the basis for the scaffold since they may provide the most life-like circumstance. The myocytes fuse together to form myotubes, which eventually becomes a body of skeletal muscle. The cells need to be continuously allowed to contract in order to avoid atrophy, a condition of muscle wasting. Electrical stimulation coupled with the scaffold has been shown to be resourceful in some organisms [19]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> For large-scale productions the usage of a bioreactor is necessary to provide the adequate conditions. Lastly, to provide a texture and flavor similar to traditional meat, Edelman et. al have suggested co-culturing myoblasts with fat cells [20]. However, other methods include mixing the meat with fat cells and additives to mimic farmed meat.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>The Implications</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers from the University of Oxford and the University of Amsterdam have found a substantial decrease in negative environmental impacts from large-scale production of cultured meat in comparison to its traditional counterparts of beef, sheep, pork, and poultry meat. The production of 1000 kg of cultured meat requires 7 to 45 percent lower energy use than traditional meat, except for poultry, which requires less than cultured meat. The study shows 78 to 96 percent less greenhouse gas emissions, 99 percent less land use, and 82 to 96 percent less water usage with cultured meat. Variation in percentage points were attributed to the different organisms that cultured meat was compared to [15].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is crucial to note that the protocols required to make cultured meat in IMPS require components from animals that still need to be farmed \u2014 for the time being. Acquisition of satellite cells require muscle samples, and the medium required to culture the cells, Fetal Calf Serum, shows that lab grown meat is not quite independent of traditional animal agriculture. However, with advancements in tissue engineering and improvements made to the techniques, it may be possible to bring cultured meat to market that no longer requires animal farming.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Dunn, Margery G.

Writing this review helped me understand the known mechanisms and the techniques used to perform functional assessments of the molecule. I learned how to review literature to find key information and create a story from different sources. I hope that the reader will become interested in one of the major concepts of my review and will continue exploring it on their own time. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1917\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Background</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Clinical Presentation of Heart Failure</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br/>\n</span></i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death in the U.S. population (American Heart Association). HF is defined by structural and functional impairments of the heart muscle that may be caused by chronic neurohormonal stimulation [1]. A common precursors to HF is cardiac hypertrophy, which is characterized by increased cell size, reorganization of sarcomere structure, and reactivation of fetal genes\u2013all contributing to pathogenic cardiac remodeling [2]. Although many treatments exist, this condition is associated with poor prognosis, low quality of life and frequent hospital readmissions [3]. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and Its Involvement in HF</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Low cardiac output is an early sign of heart failure that triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as a compensatory mechanism to increase the fluid volume. Although the cardiac output is temporarily increased, chronic angiotensin II and aldosterone as well as sympathetic nervous system stimulation eventually result in fluid overload. This paradox contributes to accumulation of damage to the cardiovascular system, which may ultimately result in myocardial ischemia, hypertrophy, and arrhythmia [4]. The RAAS is a key regulator in the cardiovascular system and its role in conditions such as hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and atherosclerosis is well established. Components of the RAAS are known biomarkers of HF and are targeted therapeutically with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin, mineralocorticoid, and aldosterone receptor antagonists [4].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The RAAS is a major endocrine-paracrine system that regulates vasoconstriction (via angiotensin II) and salt-water balance (via aldosterone). The activation cascade is initiated with renin, an enzyme produced in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney in response to decreased systemic volume and low renal perfusion pressure. Angiotensinogen is a precursor produced in the liver and is cleaved by renin to form angiotensin I. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves angiotensin I into angiotensin II, promoting the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal gland. Angiotensin II is locally produced in the heart, which may exacerbate heart failure symptoms in patients with activated RAAS [5]. Aldosterone increases the permeability of the kidney to sodium, thereby increasing retention of salt and water in the body. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>The Role of Protein Kinase D in Modulating the Raas and Hf</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Several studies have recently suggested a role for Protein Kinase D (PKD), a regulator of cardiac hypertrophy, in modulating the RAAS. PKD is a stress responsive kinase that belongs to the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKII) superfamily. CaMKIIs play a role in calcium handling and excitation-contraction coupling in the cardiomyocytes. There are 3 known isoforms of PKD, of which PKD1 is most highly expressed in the heart [6][7][8]. PKD affects a wide array of cellular processes including contractility, survival, proliferation and differentiation, actin dynamics, substrate utilization and gene transcription. PKD1 has also been linked to pathological cardiac remodeling, immune regulation, angiogenesis and cancer [9][10]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Role of PKD1 in Heart Failure</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There has been growing evidence of PKD1\u2019s involvement in heart failure. Harrison et al. identified that suppression of PKD1 activity in cardiomyocytes results in a decrease of hypertrophic responses such as reduction in cell size and expression of fetal markers, while constitutive expression exhibits ventricular chamber dilation, wall thinning, and enlargement of the atria. PKD1 phosphorylation has been observed in response to pressure overload, consistent with the cardiac hypertrophy model. Additional evidence from the same study suggests that mice with cardiac-specific PKD1 knockout (cPKD1 KO) are resistant to hypertrophy and fibrosis after induced thoracic aortic constriction, which involves surgical occlusion of the aorta to induce HF [11]. PKD1 expression is upregulated in rabbit HF and in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. PKD1 may be interacting with nuclear-localized class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) that regulate re-expression of fetal genes leading to hypertrophy [12][13][14]. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Under stress the heart alters its metabolism leading to increased utilization of carbohydrate substrates, similar to conditions before birth. After birth, the heart takes on the adult isoform, primarily utilizing energy from fatty acid oxidation. To meet the demands of hypertrophy conditions, alternative metabolism genes, also known as fetal genes, become expressed ultimately leading to cardiac remodeling or reversion to a fetal state.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) Point to PRKD1 as a Potential HF Marker</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genome-wide association studies look at correlations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or mutations and disease. A recent study pointed to SNPs in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PRKD1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, PKD1 gene,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that are associated with elevated BMI and obesity. Further studies confirmed truncations in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PRKD1</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in patients with autosomal recessive truncus arteriosus, a congenital heart condition where the aorta and pulmonary artery are fused disrupting the appropriate blood flow. Spontaneous deletions in the gene are also associated with abnormal cardiac physiology [15]. Patients harboring nonsense mutations in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PRKD1 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">are also linked to congenital heart defects [16]. These findings are not surprising since </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PRKD1</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">-/-</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> results in embryonic lethality [11], suggesting that mutations in the gene may result in aberrant cardiac development. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Angiotensin II-mediated Activation of PKD1 </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Angiotensin II activates PKD1 through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) residing on the cell\u2019s membrane, which allows it to interact with downstream cardiac ion channels [17]. Prolonged stimulation with angiotensin II may result in hypertrophy. Cardiac-specific PKD1 knockout prevented hypertrophy after treatment with angiotensin II [11]. PKD1 is also known to assemble with Protein Kinase C (PKC) and translocate the Z-disks of the cardiac sarcomeres in response to angiotensin II. Z-disk protein assembly comprises a sarcomere unit that is crucial for the structure maintenance, signal transduction [18][19], and is likely involved in transmitting pro hypertrophic signals [23]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Aldosterone effects on PKD1 </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chronic exposure to aldosterone is associated with cardiac fibrosis (Brilla et al.). PKD1 is activated by aldosterone in mice, while treatment with aldosterone inhibitors prevents hypertrophy, pointing to the its involvement in profibrotic responses [20]. Additional studies demonstrate aldosterone-mediated PKD1 activation through mineralcoid receptors in the kidney [21]. and angiotensin II-mediated aldosterone secretion through constitutively active PKD1 signaling in adrenal cells [22]. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the recent advancements in cardiovascular medicine, novel molecular targets are necessary to precisely treat the underlying causes of HF. Although PKD seems to be heavily involved in HF, there are currently no direct treatments that target this kinase. Further studies of PKD activity in the heart may uncover new therapeutic targets that could be better alternatives to conventional RAAS inhibitors. While PKD has been an actively researched molecule, its precise activity in different subcellular compartments and pathogenic signaling remains to be fully understood. Future studies may pave the way for further development of anti-fibrotic and hypertrophic treatments that inhibit the angiotensin II-aldosterone dynamics.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [1] Dassanayaka, Sujith, and Steven P.

        "title": "Cause of Seizures in Individuals with Angelman Syndrome",

        "date": "03/01/2019",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While browsing recent scientific achievements and breaking news in the scientific community, I came across an article declaring that the 125-year-old neuroscience mystery surrounding perineuronal nets (PNNs) is finally resolved. PNNs have stumped neuroscientists for decades, yet their importance is undeniable. To understand the extent of this discovery, I read more about PNNs and found that they have a key connection to Angelman syndrome, which causes severe epileptic seizures in children. The new findings from the Philpot Lab identifying the purpose of PNNs draw a connection between PNNs and seizures, and this information can lead to improved medications and therapeutic treatment methods. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1921\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The genetic disorder Angelman syndrome results in developmental and intellectual disabilities in children. Symptoms start to appear from the ages of six to twelve months with more severe symptoms, specifically epileptic seizures, occurring around the ages of two to three years old (1). Angelman syndrome is defined as the loss of function of the maternal UBE3A gene due to abnormal prenatal or postnatal development. Around 70% of cases are due to the deletion of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15 (1). Other cases are a result of a mutation in the maternal copy or, more rarely, a mutation being passed down by genetic inheritance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, scientists have observed that the neurons of people with Angelman syndrome have an abnormal amount of perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs were first identified in 1893 by Camillo Golgi (3). They consist of the extracellular matrix around the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of neurons. PNNs usually surround neurons of the Central Nervous System \u2013 the neurons of the brain and spinal cord (3). Over the past decade, it has been determined that PNNs play a critical role in neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, strokes, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and epilepsy. Both the UBE3A gene and PNNs affect the rate of transmission of electrical signals in the brain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers are currently trying to decipher the exact role of the UBE3A gene and PNNs. They believe that PNNs may be an indicator of excitatory activity in the brain. By restoring the function of the maternal gene or activating the paternal gene, which is silenced in the parts of the brain affected by Angelman syndrome, researchers believe that they can predict and prevent epileptic seizures. Current efforts are focused on therapeutic treatment and enzyme inhibitors. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>UBE3A Gene</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While researching seizures in individuals with Angelman syndrome, a team of scientists from the Philpot Lab at UNC School of Medicine investigated gene therapy as a potential solution. The study used a mouse model and inserted a dormant UBE3A gene into the mouse\u2019s brain that can be activated by chemical signals. The goal of the study was to test if improvements could be seen in individuals with Angelman syndrome if the UBE3A gene was repaired after birth. If the gene is restorable, then Angelman syndrome could be curable if caught quickly enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gu et al. found that restoration of a working gene could prevent epileptic seizures if turned on at the age of three weeks, but resulted in no improvement in adult mice. Three weeks of a mouse\u2019s lifetime equates to the early childhood of a human, which suggests that there is a significant chance that Angelman syndrome can be reversed if treated early enough. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gu et al. wanted to further test if the gene needed to be restored in all types of neurons. They first tried removing the UBE3A gene from only excitatory genes and found that the absence of the gene from only these neurons did not result in seizures. Furthermore, when they removed the UBE3A gene only from inhibitory neurons, they observed more seizures than if the UBE3A gene was missing from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since the UBE3A gene is correlated to neurons firing faster, these results suggest that the main role of the UBE3A gene is to ensure that the inhibitory neurons fire faster than the excitatory neurons. Without the UBE3A gene in inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons continue to send electrical signals after a message has been sent because the inhibitory neurons are unable to fire fast enough to stop the excitatory neurons\u2019 signals. Therefore, scientists primarily need to repair the gene in inhibitory neurons, so these neurons are able to fire quickly enough to prevent excess electrical activity. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Perineuronal Nets</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During their experiments, the Philpot lab team found an abnormal accumulation of PNNs in the hippocampus of individuals affected by Angelman syndrome. This accumulation of PNNs did not occur in the hippocampus of individuals without this disorder. Gu et al. determined that these distinct structures act as biomarkers for \u201cenhanced seizure susceptibility.\u201d Furthering these findings, Sontheimer et al. at Virginia Tech looked at the role of PNNs in preventing seizures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In their study, Sontheimer et al. used a mouse model with glioblastoma, or brain cancer, to test which features of brain cancer lead to seizures. They found two key aspects that led to seizures: the neurotransmitter glutamate and the enzyme MMP (Matrix metalloproteinase). Glioblastoma is typically restricted by the size of the skull, but glutamate and MMP help create space for the highly-metastasizing cancer to continue to spread (5). The team suspected that these two features may directly affect the PNNs, which in turn results in seizures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Glutamate kills cells around the tumor to create more space for the tumor to spread. Interestingly, glutamate targets cells that have the UBE3A gene and produce the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which lowers membrane capacitance, or the ability to store electrical charge and as a result send electrical signals quickly (5). GABA is typically found in inhibitory neurons, which stop the firing of neurons after a message has already been relayed. GABA helps prevent excess electrical impulses, which in turn can prevent a seizure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Glioblastoma also secretes the enzyme MMP, which dissolves the PNNs (5). Sontheimer et al. conducted an experiment where only the enzyme MMP was added to a healthy brain. The team found that the loss of the PNNs resulted in seizures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PNNs, found mainly on inhibitory neurons, prevent excess electrical impulses after a message has been relayed by releasing the neurotransmitter GABA, lowering the membrane capacitance. If the PNNs are missing from GABA-releasing neurons, electrical impulses will not be inhibited fast enough. Therefore, there will be excess electrical impulses leading to sudden surges of electrical activity, or seizures. These results suggest that a potential treatment could be an enzyme inhibitor, but more research is needed to fully back this medication. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, these findings directly correlate to the findings of Gu et al. who found that more seizures occurred when the UBE3A gene is missing from inhibitory neurons. This suggests that both PNNs and the UBE3A gene are essential in preventing excess electrical activity. Since people with Angelman syndrome are only missing the UBE3A gene but still get seizures, it has been suggested that both the gene and PNNs must be present in order to prevent seizures. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Angelman syndrome consists of two major factors: the presence of the UBE3A gene and PNNs. Gu et al. found that Angelman syndrome could be reverted if the gene was activated during early childhood. Furthermore, the Philpot lab study suggests that seizures, in general, may be correlated to PNNs. These findings are crucial for further research on preventing epileptic seizures for other neurological disorders, in addition to Angelman syndrome. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For both Angelman syndrome and glioblastoma, the neurons that release the neurotransmitter GABA are responsible for preventing seizures. For Angelman syndrome, the UBE3A gene in the inhibitory neurons is mutated, and for glioblastoma, the PNNs are dissolved. These findings suggest that both the gene and nets are necessary for preventing excess excitatory activity. Further experimentation is needed to support these claims. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These findings not only have the potential to revert Angelman syndrome, but they also may help prevent one of the most severe symptoms of a multitude of neurological disorders: epileptic seizures. Findings like these can help uncover more about how the brain works and also help improve the quality of life for those with neurological disorders.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAngelman syndrome \u2013 Genetics Home Reference \u2013 NIH.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">U.S. National Library of Medicine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, National Institutes of Health, ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/angelman-syndrome.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ives, James. \u201cGenetic Therapy May Help Children with Angelman syndrome to Overcome Seizures.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">News-Medical.net</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, News Medical, 21 Nov. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.news-medical.net/news/20181121/Genetic-therapy-may-help-children-with-Angelman-syndrome-to-overcome-seizures.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.news-medical.net/news/20181121/Genetic-therapy-may-help-children-with-Angelman-syndrome-to-overcome-seizures.aspx</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPerineuronal Net.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NeuroImage</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Academic Press, </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/perineuronal-net\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/perineuronal-net</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cPerineuronal Nets and Epilepsy | Neuroscience.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">LabRoots</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, LabRoots, Inc., </span><a href=\"http://www.labroots.com/trending/neuroscience/13240/perineuronal-nets-epilepsy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.labroots.com/trending/neuroscience/13240/perineuronal-nets-epilepsy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cScientists Solve Century-Old Neuroscience Mystery; Answers May Lead to Epilepsy Treatment.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ScienceDaily</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, ScienceDaily, 9 Nov. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181109073036.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181109073036.htm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSolving a Century-Old Neuroscience Puzzle May Lead to Epilepsy Therapy.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">FierceBiotech</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, 9 Nov. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/solving-a-century-old-neuroscience-puzzle-may-lead-to-epilepsy-therapy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.fiercebiotech.com/research/solving-a-century-old-neuroscience-puzzle-may-lead-to-epilepsy-therapy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">UNC_Health_Care. \u201cCan Genetic Therapy Help Kids with Angelman syndrome Overcome Seizures?\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">EurekAlert!</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/uonc-cgt112018.php.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

        "date": "03/29/2019",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s note</h4> I first learned about this news through an article on Big Think that provided few details about the science behind the breakthrough. Reading the original research paper clarified both how this research had been conducted and what was so noteworthy about it. Given the prevalence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this new study may yet prove to be instrumental in the disorder\u2019s treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2005\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A new study by Zheng et al. has elucidated a novel way of potentially treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease (1). This neurodegenerative disorder affects a large portion of the elderly population, presenting as a functional decline in cognition and behavior often associated with dementia (1, 2). As such, much attention has been paid toward finding its underlying causes and its amenability to possible treatments (1).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are currently only two anti-Alzheimer\u2019s disease medications approved by the Federal Drug Administration, but much work is being done to illuminate possible alternatives (1, 2). Zheng et al.\u2019s approach involves epigenetic dysregulation, a means through which gene expression in the brain can be altered. Using a late-stage familiar Alzheimer\u2019s disease (FAD) mouse model, Zheng et al. found that levels of histone methylation were significantly increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a key region involved in the disease. These same findings were observed in the PFC of post-mortem tissues from patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In particular, histone H3 dimethylation at lysine 9 (H3K9me2) was elevated in the PFC region for both of these models (1).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zheng et al. focused on the euchromatic histone methyltransferases EHMT1 and EHMT2, which specifically catalyze H3K9 dimethylation, as the culprits for the observed phenomenon. They discovered that the levels of these enzymes were unusually high in the PFC of aged FAD mice (1).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These abnormal histone modifications were linked to a reduction in the transcription and expression of glutamate receptors \u2014 especially AMPA and NMDA receptors \u2014 in the PFC of aged FAD mice. Upon treating FAD mice with BIX01294, a specific EHMT1/2 inhibitor, Zheng et al. found that the H3K9me2 level was reduced. Additionally, the transcription and expression of glutamate receptors was restored in the PFC (1).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The loss of glutamate receptor transcription and expression in aged FAD mice also resulted in reduced glutamatergic signaling in the PFC of FAD mice. When treated with selective EHMT1/2 inhibitors, synaptic responses mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors were brought back to normal levels. Knockdown of EHMT1 and EHMT2 in FAD mice produced the same effect. Notably, Zheng et al. also observed this recovery of synaptic function in the hippocampus, which showed the same alterations in H3K9me2 and glutamate receptors as the PFC (1).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genome-wide analysis revealed that in FAD mice, genes involved in neuronal signaling \u2014 including glutamate receptors \u2014 showed enriched H3K9 dimethylation. This enrichment could be largely reversed by treatment with the aforementioned inhibitor BIX 01294 (1).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zheng et al. also performed behavioral tests with FAD mice to gauge the potential of EHMT1/2 inhibitors as therapeutic agents. The tests were designed to assess the mice\u2019s novel object recognition memory, working memory, and spatial memory. After treatment with these inhibitors, the mice showed marked improvements in all three categories (1).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though the etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease remains uncertain, research continues on novel ways to treat it. Zheng et al.\u2019s recent study suggests that epigenetic modifications such as histone methylation may play a key role in the disorder\u2019s progression. In time, this epigenetic approach could be applied toward drug therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, representing a promising avenue for future research into the matter.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zheng Y, Liu A, Wang Z-J, Cao Q, Wang W, Lin L, Ma K, Zhang F, Wei J, Matas E, et al.

I wanted to explore the link to genetics and to see how thoroughly we understand the underlying causes of obesity, specifically in children. Further, the judgement of both the children and the children\u2019s parents has brought up a conversation about whether or not it is okay to place a child into foster care for treatment of obesity, due to lack of care by the parents. Initially, research into foster care seemed out of place in this paper. However, I think it\u2019s an interesting way to combine the scientific advancements outlined in this review paper with the social contentions surrounding obesity.

The CDC defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) in the 95</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> percentile of children with the same age and sex, while morbid pediatric obesity is considered as having a BMI in the 99</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> percentile.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Various causes of obesity have been identified, including environmental factors such as diet, level of sedentary lifestyle, and parental BMI. Recently, genetic links to pediatric obesity have been identified and studied. Many genes, including portions of the FTO gene (fat mass and obesity-associated) and 3q29 (a section of DNA on chromosome 3), have been shown to be strongly linked.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3,4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Other genes, which were believed to be linked to appetite, have been shown to have no causation with obesity. It is interesting to consider this data in the context of foster care. New studies gathering data from a large sample size of adolescents in foster care have interesting findings. Consideration of this data is important in the discussion of whether or not foster care is an effective treatment option for pediatric obesity. While foster care is not a conventional treatment for obesity, it can be considered in cases where parents are showing neglect. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This review will outline various findings concerning the link between pediatric obesity and genetics. This involves examining studies which suggest a link between genetics and obesity, and also studies which show no causation for a certain gene. Further investigations will be done on publications which outline the changes in BMI after children have entered foster care and the implications of these findings on the causes of pediatric obesity.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Genetic Links</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">FTO and MC4R</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throughout the past five years, many studies have shown strong genetic links to pediatric obesity. One of these genes is the fat mass and obesity-associated gene, or FTO gene. In one previous publication, researchers utilized a cross-sectional study of over 16,000 children to search for a statistical association between FTO variant rs9939609, total macronutrient intake, and the subsequent effect on BMI.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> They found that this particular FTO variant is predictive of both a high BMI and an associated higher nutrient intake.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0The FTO gene codes for fat mass and obesity-associated protein, which is important in breaking down dietary fats.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Another research group had a similar question about the FTO gene and variant rs9939609, except they approached the data analysis differently. Rather than looking at whether or not genetic variations modified fat intake, they examined whether or not an increase in macronutrient intake increased the gene\u2019s expression.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Their findings show that a higher fat intake of an individual increased the activity of the FTO variant.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The gene expresses itself in a positive feedback manner because the FTO variant rs993609 is predictive of a higher BMI and higher nutrient intake. Further, higher macronutrient intake leads to a higher expression of this variant. This variant has a correlation with and effect on pediatric obesity.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another closely related study looked at the ability of carriers of the FTO GG (a certain genotype of the FTO gene) and/or MC4R CC (melanocortin 4 receptor) gene to lose weight. In order to examine this, researchers screened a large population of obese children and studied those with varying levels of the protein Lp-PLA2, which is the product of FTO GG and/or MC4R CC.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Obese carriers of these genes were statistically able to lose significantly more weight than non-carriers.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Certain variants of the FTO gene are associated with weight loss, while others are associated with a higher BMI and a higher fat intake. Both indicate a link between pediatric obesity and genetic factors.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prader-Willi Syndrome and MO1 Syndrome</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other genetic variants include copy number variants of 3q29 and syndromic, where the patient is showing symptoms (15q11.2 deletions, Prader-Willi syndrome) and non-syndromic (16p11.2 deletion).</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5.6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> A copy number variant is when a portion of the genome is repeated at a different rate than the rest of the population, thus leading to a different number of repeats in the genome of the variant. Prader-Willi syndrome and a deletion of 16p11.2 have been shown to be linked to pediatric obesity, although they are rare deletions.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Researchers were wondering how significant the relation between rare copy number variants and \u00a0pediatric obesity was, so they genetically tested a group of pediatric obese patients versus healthy-weight pediatric patients.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> They found many copy number variants in the obese subject group and concluded that copy number variants statistically contribute to a substantial amount of pediatric obesity cases.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other researchers investigated an Arab-Israeli family living in northern Israel. In the family there were 15 obese patients with 31 unaffected, relatively healthy family members. Despite growing up in a very similar environment, with comparable diets and exercise levels, 33% of the family faced obesity with associated glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia (elevated fats and cholesterol in the blood), and insulin resistance.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> While this was not a specific study on pediatric obesity, all affected family members developed childhood obesity by age 3.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The researchers genetically screened every member of the family and found that all affected by obesity were missing the gene coding for CEP19.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> They verified these results with knockout mice for the same gene. The mice were found to be morbidly obese, glucose intolerant, and insulin resistant, and they also had \u00a0a notably increased appetite.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">6</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> A wide variety of genetic variations, including mutations, deletions, or insertions, can contribute to the spread of pediatric obesity. Many genes have been investigated and are thought to affect obesity; however, it is important to discuss studies that show no correlations between genetics and obesity. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Genetics with no causation</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While there are many genes which are now thought to be connected to obesity, many have been thoroughly studied and shown to have little relation to obesity. Certain genes which have been linked to appetite were studied to find a link to higher BMI. Genes which code for proteins called Neuropeptide Y and Neuropeptide receptor 2 (NPY and NPY2R, respectively) have been shown to have a positive effect on the appetite of an individual. Since there was a connection to appetite, researchers hypothesized that it may further have an effect on obesity. Adolescents with varying BMIs up to age 14 were screened for overexpression of the previously-mentioned genes and also for genetic variations. This study found no significant variants of NPY2R and some minor variants of NPY, but both these genes were overall found to have no significant contribution to the obese population.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">7</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It is notable to discuss that genes linked to appetite can still be secondarily linked to obesity, even if their expressions can\u2019t be linked to BMI directly. Another study screened for variants of the SH2B1 gene, a gene which codes for a protein which interacts with insulin receptors. The study was broad, and included a large percentage of the Belgian adolescent population. While many variants of the gene were found between healthy and obese subjects, no causation was identified between variants and obesity.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">8</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Researchers do conclude that while causation cannot be statistically verified, it can also not be entirely ruled out.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">8</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> In another study on adult Americans, researchers </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">did</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> find a link between SH2B1 and obesity.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> A notable difference between the studies was the age. In Belgium, researchers looked at only adolescents, while the study in America looked only at adults. The juxtaposition of these findings highlight how far we are from a full understanding of this disease and its various causes.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Foster Care</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now that we have examined the link between genetics and obesity, we will examine data connecting foster care and obesity. This is interesting data to analyze for multiple reasons. </span></i></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Foster care as a treatment for pediatric obesity is currently a heavily-debated, controversial topic. Furthermore, foster care is a dramatic change in a child\u2019s environment. Because of this, we can analyze this data in the context of genetic factors versus environmental factors having an effect on obesity. </span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is currently some debate among experts about whether or not foster care is an appropriate option for children who suffer from pediatric obesity, particularly those with morbid obesity. This stems from the idea that parents of obese children do not provide sufficient care by either over-feeding their children or not providing regular, healthy meals. Case studies, where an obese or morbidly obese child is placed into foster care and their weight is studied, are common in this field. A recent study mapped the weight fluctuations of 360 children who were placed into foster care. In children aged 2-5 years, there was a significantly lowered BMI after entering into foster care. However, no significant total change was found across all ages.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">9</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Another similar study compared the BMIs of foster children to standardized normal BMIs in the general population. It was found that children in foster care were more likely to have a higher BMI than children who were not in foster care.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">10</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Foster care has positive and negative effects on each individual child. However, in evaluating a large sample size of children within the foster care system, foster care may not be helpful in treating pediatric obesity and could potentially be contributing to the prevalence of the disease. These findings qualify the previous discussion on pediatric obesity and genetics, as altering a child\u2019s environment does not appear to reduce their BMI and may even lead to an increase in BMI. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While pediatric obesity can have many causes, recent studies have shown a link between genetics and this disease. These findings are particularly interesting in the context of discussing foster care as a treatment option for pediatric obesity. Data suggests that changing a child\u2019s environment by placing them into foster care may have little beneficial effects on pediatric obesity and can even contribute to the disease. Physicians\u2019 current treatment plans for obesity involve recommending lifestyle changes; however, environmental changes will not alter phenotypic effects. With an understanding of the underlying genetic causation, further research could be done on the efficacy of treatment plans for pediatric obesity. Re-evaluation of current treatment plans for pediatric obesity appears important, considering the recent findings about various causes of pediatric obesity.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Defining Childhood Obesity (2016). </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Center for Disease Control</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When I found out that CRISPR was used for the first time on human embryos that were fully brought to term, I was pretty surprised that such a new technology with numerous unknowns was being used on the germline. I was interested in understanding the reasoning for such an experiment and what may come out of it in the long run. To some, CRISPR may seem like a far off technology that could be applied to humans in the distant future. However, the experiment on the twin fetuses that went through this \u201cgenetic surgery\u201d proves that CRISPR is happening now and is likely to stay. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>But first, how does Crispr work?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a genome editing technology that is cheaper, faster, more accurate, and more efficient than other existing genome editing methods [1]. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was initially adapted from the prokaryotic defense system, where CRISPRs are found in both archaea and bacteria [5]. CRISPR arrays serve as an integral part of the immune system by consisting of repeating sequences of genetic code which are interrupted by \u201cspacer\u201d sequences \u2014 residues of genetic code from previously attacking bacteriophages [1,5]. When the viruses attack again, the bacteria transcribe CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from the \u201cspacer\u201d regions in the CRISPR arrays to latch onto the viral DNA, where Cas9 \u2014 \u00a0an enzyme that recognizes the crRNA \u2014 will cut the DNA, causing the knockout to cease the progression of the attack [5].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the lab, the CRISPR system works in a similar manner. Researchers can also utilize various other enzymes to cleave the unwanted DNA, one such being Cpf1. Where CRISPR-Cas9 would produce blunt ends \u2014 a complex where the DNA is cut at the same location on each strand \u2014 CRISPR-Cpf1 cuts DNA at different locations, thus creating short single-stranded overhangs [5]. These overhangs, otherwise called sticky ends, can help make the insertion of new DNA more stringent, accurate, and of the correct orientation. Various enzymes also recognize different areas on the DNA; this differentiation allows researchers to allocate enzymes to their area of study [5]. Once the DNA is cut, segments of interest can be inserted or deleted by using the cell\u2019s mechanism of homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous-end joining (NHEJ) [1, 6]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scientists hope to expand their findings pertaining to CRISPR on a variety of issues, especially single-gene disorders such as hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell disease. In the long term, CRISPR also shows promise in preventing or treating cancer, heart disease, mental illness, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [1]. However, these findings and advancements in application come with various ethical concerns. As of now, most changes introduced with genome editing are limited to somatic cells. This ensures that changes are restricted to few tissues and cannot be passed down from one generation to another; however, changes made to germline cells, or even to embryos, can be passed down to future generations. Since this area is still relatively new and unknown, there is not yet enough information about the accuracy and long-lasting impact. Off-target effects could prove disastrous as there would be an entirely new set of unforeseen consequences. Moreover, even at the right target, genes interact in a complicated matter; changes at one site could have implications in a completely different area. Multiple unknowns coupled with long term consequences led to a tremendous outcry after it was revealed that two twin girls were born after having changes made at their embryonic stage. </span></p>\n<p><h4>The Trial</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While He Jiankui has not published a paper describing the methodology and details on his experiment, he released a promotional video for his study on The He Lab YouTube channel on November 25, 2018. He describes how because \u201cMark\u201d is HIV positive, he and his wife \u201cGrace\u201d were concerned that their children would potentially be positive as well [2]. This made them viable candidates for the experiment. He Jiankui mentions that along with fertilizing Grace\u2019s egg with Mark\u2019s sperm, the researchers also \u201csent a little bit of protein and instructions\u201d that would do a \u201cgene surgery\u201d to remove the doorway in which HIV enters to \u201cinfect people\u201d [2]. \u00a0In the video, He claims that the team considered the surgery to be a success, as confirmed by genome sequencing [2]. Lastly, twin embryos were implanted via regular IVF \u201cwith one difference\u201d [2]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This resulted in the first \u201cCRISPR babies\u201d: \u201cLulu\u201d and \u201cNana.\u201d He acknowledges that his actions will spark unparalleled controversy; however, he describes this path as no different than when in vitro fertilization (IVF) was first used to create Louise Joy Brown in 1977.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the limited information published in Shenzhen HOME Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital ethics committee review application, mouse and monkey models were initially used to conduct \u201crigorous\u201d early-test studies for the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">gene since it serves as a receptor that the latches onto a white blood cell [3, 4, 7].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The next step was embryos of model organisms similar to humans were examined after going through CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing [3]. Genetically edited embryonic stem cells were isolated to determine if they abnormally propagated and whether they differentiated after genetic testing [3]. To address off-target effects, two methods were used. Firstly, using high-fidelity Cas9 enzymes, He was able increase stringency and reduce off target effects [3]. Secondly, the best single guide RNA (sgRNA) was selected for which consists of the crRNA fused to the scaffold tracrRNA sequence that Cas nuclease binds to [7]. Using these critical steps, the</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> CCR5 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">region was able to be deleted. </span></p>\n<p><h4>What is Next?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the Associated Press, He altered the embryos of seven couples, with the birth of only Lulu and Nana so far [9, 10]. In every case, the father was infected with the disease, and the mother was HIV-negative. He\u2019s goal was to introduce an uncommon, natural genetic variation that would make it difficult for HIV to infect white blood cells [8]. By deleting the receptor, the apparent intent was not to reduce the chance of transmission from the father, since the likelihood naturally decreases when the sperm is washed before insemination during IVF. Rather, He stated that he wanted to reduce the chance of infection later on in life [8]. While He claims that he is against gene editing for enhancement purposes and that it should only be used for therapy, many question whether his actions prove hypocritical [2]. \u00a0Many assert that He\u2019s actions suggest that being born HIV susceptible is a disease state; however, common sense tells indicates otherwise, and that the lengths that He went through to reduce HIV susceptibility are not medically justified [8, 9]. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The limited information suggests that He\u2019s editing was incomplete, and that one of the twins is mosaic [9]. This would mean that only some cells have the silenced </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> gene, thus indicating that there is a significant likelihood that she would not be protected from HIV [9, 10]. Even with a successful deletion all around, certain strains of HIV can still enter cells through CXCR4, a protein [9]. When geneticists first identified people with a natural genetic variation consisting of non-working copies of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">it was thought that they would be resistant to HIV without any repercussions [9]. \u00a0However, later studies showed that deficiency in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> meant that people were more susceptible to infections like West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, and more likely to die from influenza [9, 11]. While CRISPR can help spearhead numerous medical advancements, there is no doubt that many unknowns remain. Unintended consequences that the twins and other potential children of this study could face would prove that the progression of CRISPR applications for humans, especially for embryos, is premature. </span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWhat Are Genome Editing and CRISPR-Cas9? \u2013 Genetics Home Reference \u2013 NIH.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">U.S. National Library of Medicine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, National Institutes of Health.

I specifically chose this topic because I think breast cancer is a smart, complex disease, and the treatment can change day-to-day. I wanted to shed light on a widely accepted breast cancer treatment that is now under review after discovering that it can cause cardiac dysfunction.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-2406\"></span></p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A portion of all metastatic breast cancers overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). When HER2 is overexpressed, the cell uncontrollably divides.\u00a0 This form of cancer is commonly treated with a combinatorial treatment of chemotherapy and Herceptin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a9</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, clinically known as trastuzumab, to specifically target overexpression of these receptor proteins. Recently, cardiotoxicity and cardiac adverse events have presented in patients treated with trastuzumab for ten years or longer. The prevalence of this side effect has resulted in several studies to determine trastuzumab mode of action in cardiotoxicity and its overall efficacy in long-term treatment. This literature review examines the association between trastuzumab-use and cardiac dysfunction, followed by recent discoveries that potentially explain the mechanism it affects. Finally, this review examines the effect of time interval on efficacy of trastuzumab and cardiotoxicity risk reduction in patients. More research is necessary to determine the absolute risk of cardiotoxicity with prolonged treatment and potential biosimilars that contain similar efficacy but reduce the risk of cardiac dysfunction.</span><h4></h4></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to an article by Paddock (8), up to 20% of all invasive breast cancers are caused by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 proteins, also known as erbB proteins, are a family of proteins that play a role in development and the maintenance of cells during a mammal\u2019s lifetime. This protein is used as a dimerization (a process where two proteins bind together to carry out their function) component of other HER2 proteins to form a receptor; these receptors initiate a signaling cascade that controls the division and growth of cells (7). The overproduction of this protein is the cause of a quarter of breast cancers diagnosed yearly. This correlation has led to the targeting of HER2 for breast cancer treatment. Trastuzumab (commercially known as Herceptin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (an antibody from a non-human source that\u2019s been engineered to work similarly in humans), that specifically targets the HER2 receptor (1). It binds to HER2 receptors to interfere with its dimerization process; this causes the cell to arrest and reduce HER2\u2019s signaling pathway (1). Use of trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, has increased the 10-year survival rate of cancer patients from 75% to 84% (8).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although trastuzumab has proven to be extremely effective in treating HER2 breast cancers, current studies have observed that cardiotoxicity is a side effect. Characteristics of cardiac dysfunction, as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee (CREC), can include a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), symptoms of congestive heart failure, associated signs of congestive heart failure, or a combination of a decline of LVEF by 55% and accompanying signs of congestive heart failure (10). Several retrospective analyses have been conducted on previous clinical trials using trastuzumab to determine the percentage of patients inflicted with cardiotoxicity. A cohort study conducted by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center observed that 27% of their patients experienced cardiac dysfunction as a result of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment (2). This study was one of the first to conclude that cardiotoxicity is a significant side effect that deserves more research and exploration.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This review will examine the association between trastuzumab use and cardiotoxicity, the mechanisms and pathways it affects, and the possible methods of reducing the risk of a cardiac adverse event in patients undergoing this treatment.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity as observed in animal models</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the increased incidence rate of cardiotoxicity detected in patients treated with trastuzumab, researchers have attempted to recreate it in animal models that can be used to determine adverse effects. A pre-clinical investigation conducted by Milano et al. (5) induced cardiotoxicity with using doxorubicin and trastuzumab in a mouse model. Doxorubicin is an antitumor anthracycline that\u2019s commonly used to treat cancer in conjunction with an antibody-specific treatment (5).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Through these mice models, the researchers found that trastuzumab alone decreased erbB2 and erbB4 gene expression in the cardiomyocytes of the left ventricle; this decreased expression led to dilation of the left ventricle but was normally reversible with discontinuation of the treatment. Doxorubicin, on the other hand, was shown to reduce the thickness of the left and right ventricle walls. Trastuzumab was found to exacerbate the effects caused by doxorubicin, not cause them (5). This study was one of the first to recognize and understand the effects of repeated trastuzumab and doxorubicin injections on pathophysiology.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The results from this study strongly suggest that trastuzumab has a role in exacerbating cardiac dysfunction induced by Doxorubicin, but it is not the sole cause. The results do not accurately describe the metabolic effect on trastuzumab in humans based on the physiological differences between human and mice. However, these findings have provided a new direction for research regarding the mechanisms underlying trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Potential mechanisms of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While there were significant findings involving animal models, Milano et al. (5) failed to provide information for researchers to understand the pathways it affects. Mohan et al. (6) studied the effect of trastuzumab on autophagy in cardiomyocytes, using mice as a vehicle. The researchers hypothesized that trastuzumab-induced autophagy modulation has implications in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS species production occurs in cardiomyocytes. The accumulation of cell damage develops into cardiotoxicity (6). The researchers found that trastuzumab dysregulates HER2-signaling, which leads to the inhibition of the autophagy pathway, disrupting the mitochondria\u2019s function and increasings ROS production.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The researchers found that after 48 hours of treatment, cells fluoresced more intensely than the control cells in response to increased oxidative stress (6). This study offers evidence that trastuzumab-binding dysregulates HER2-signaling, which may interfere with the cell\u2019s abilities to repair itself, due to oxidative damage caused by the overproduction of ROS. This opens up the discussion about whether or not trastuzumab-inhibition of erbB2 dimerization is the main method of action that causes cardiotoxicity. This study has been used as a stepping stone in understanding the mechanisms that underlie trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other researchers have used the results from the Mohan et al. (6) study to replicate trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity using human stem cells </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vitro </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to better understand its effects in humans at the molecular level. Kurokawa et al. (4) measured cardiac function from human stem cells (iPS-CMs) after 72 hours of exposure to 1 \u00b5M of trastuzumab. The researchers discovered that iPS-CMs are able to replicate the cardiotoxic consequences of trastuzumab-inhibited erbB 2/4 signaling (4). Although this discovery has important implications for cancer treatment in humans, the researchers were only able to detect cardiotoxicity when iPS-CMs were also treated with Doxorubicin (4).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The results of this study are limited, due to the fact that researchers only utilized one line of human stem cells and did not fully replicate the cardiac microenvironment found in the culture medium. While this study offers a novel human model that can better replicate toxic effects of cancer treatments, it fails to provide clarification on the direct effect of trastuzumab on cardiomyocytes to induce cardiotoxic events.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The studies and clinical trials mentioned previously concluded that trastuzumab is effective and safe for use in most patients. However, the recent research between the association between long-term use of trastuzumab and cardiotoxicity necessitates further research and exploration. Mohan et al. (6) and Kurokawa et al. (4) concluded that trastuzumab affects the HER2 signaling pathway, which has important implications in the normal function of the adult heart. Even though this is the target protein for HER2 metastatic breast cancers, further research needs to be done in order to specifically target overexpression in malignant cells or the mutant machinery that enables overexpression. It\u2019s important to explore the appropriate time interval to maximize the benefits of trastuzumab while maintaining a low risk of adverse cardiac events moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Efficacy and risk reduction associated with trastuzumab duration</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, trastuzumab is administered 1 year after chemotherapy treatment. However, recent studies have been conducted to test whether a shorter trastuzumab regimen administered during chemotherapy treatment would have similar efficacy with less risk of cardiac dysfunction in comparison to the standard. A clinical trial conducted by Joensuu et al. (3), hypothesized a 9-week combinatorial therapy of trastuzumab and chemotherapy offered the same benefit of standard treatment with trastuzumab. The researchers found that the 9-week regimen resulted in fewer cardiac events but were unable to prove that it had a significant impact on efficacy compared to the standard treatment (3). Similarly, the PHARE clinical trial hypothesized a 6-month regimen of trastuzumab compared to 1-year. The researchers were unable to conclude that the shorter duration of trastuzumab treatment resulted in the same or better therapeutic outcomes as the 1-year treatment even though cardiac dysfunction was significantly reduced. The researchers\u00a0 acknowledged that the standard treatment resulted in a small amount of cardiac toxicities but were reversible with a stoppage of treatment, as observed in 93% of affected patients (9).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The trials conducted by Joensuu et al. (3) and Pivot et al. (9) fail to prove that a shorter treatment regimen has superior therapeutic effects, even if combined with chemotherapy. However, both trials observed that the development of cardiac dysfunction is present in both lengths of treatment. Their results further support the hypothesis that trastuzumab has a significant role in the development of cardiotoxicity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The protocols used in these studies do not provide foundational evidence for predicting risks associated with long-term treatment using trastuzumab. While a small percentage of patients have irreversible adverse cardiac events, these patients are still a significant consequence for a widely accepted cancer treatment. Studies and further research should be focused on reducing and preventing the risk of major cardiac dysfunction in patients treated for longer periods of time.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the clear benefits trastuzumab provides, the risk of cardiotoxicity cannot be ignored. While the\u00a0 risk of cardiotoxicity remains low and reversible in most patients, this is not the case for a minority of patients. Current case studies reported patients who were assumed to be low risk still developed irreversible cardiac dysfunction during treatment with trastuzumab. Thus far, the \u201ccure\u201d for cardiotoxicity has been stoppage of trastuzumab administration. This leaves the patient vulnerable to remission. In response to these new concerns, researchers have begun developing and testing biosimilars of trastuzumab for similar efficacy; however, success remains low. Cardiotoxicity is a major side effect of trastuzumab, but it is the solution on the market for metastatic breast cancers. Until more definitive research is done, physicians and patients should proceed with caution and recognize the potential risk associated with trastuzumab treatment.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gemmette, J.J., &amp; Mukherji S., (2011).

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: I first came across an article talking about this new innovation on Science X. Having worked with hybridomas and antibodies through various internships, I was deeply intrigued by this discovery and secured an original paper to learn more about its potential applications. Because of the revolutionizing usage of antibodies in the medical field, it is vital to understand how this finding will facilitate antibody-based therapies in clinical research.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since the discovery of antibodies and their applications in therapeutics, many diseases once deemed incurable now have a treatment, if not a cure. Antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to specific antigens (proteins that are considered \u201cforeign\u201d to the body). The immune system recognizes this antibody-antigen complex and removes the foreign substance from the body. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are specific for one type of antigen and are produced using hybridomas, immortal cell lines that secrete only one type of antibody. The specificity of a mAb is determined by its antigen binding variable region. Though the variable region is of critical importance, the constant region (also known as the Fc region) is also essential to the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs. The Fc region has many different variants, called isotypes. Each isotype has its own unique function in making the immune system respond in different ways. After an antibody binds to an antigen by its variable region, the Fc region of the antibody elicits a response from the immune system, which serves as the basis for antibody-based therapeutics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A recent study conducted in the summer of 2019 by Schoot and colleagues demonstrates how the use of genetic engineering on hybridomas can modify the Fc region of mAbs to that of a different species, isotype, or format. This new versatile platform grants ease of production of monoclonal antibodies that have different constant regions but retain the same variable regions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The research team utilized a one-step clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/homology-directed repair (HDR) technique to create a recombinant hybridoma that secretes a mAb in the Fc format of choice \u2014 a highly attractive alternative to the conventional recombinant production methods that were often time-consuming, challenging, and expensive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the team emphasizes, \u201c[CRISPR/HDR] is a simple alternative approach requiring a single electroporation step to obtain an unlimited source of target antibody in the isotype format of choice\u201d (1). Through using CRISPR/HDR, the team was able to seamlessly generate monovalent Fab\u2019 fragments and a panel of different isotypes for the same monoclonal antibody.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Crispr/Cas9 and Homology-Directed Repair</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In their genetic engineering method, the researchers took advantage of an ancient bacterial immunity mechanism: the CRISPR/Cas9 system. When a bacteria is invaded by a virus, the bacteria stores snippets of viral DNA and creates segments of DNA called CRISPR arrays. When a virus with the same DNA segment attacks again, the bacteria creates RNA from the CRISPR arrays to target the virus; the RNA is called the guide RNA. The nuclease protein Cas9 is used to cut the DNA apart at a very specific site determined by the guide RNA, disabling the virus. CRISPR/Cas9 works in a similar fashion in the lab. Scientists create a guide RNA that binds to Cas9, which then targets a specific site on the DNA to be cut (2).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When CRISPR/Cas9 cuts DNA, it induces a double-strand break (DSB). Homology-directed repair (HDR) occurs when the intact donor strand contains high sequence homology to the damaged DNA strand. Through HDR, scientists can integrate a sequence or gene of their liking into the genome, which Schoot and colleagues perform in their study (3).\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>The Generation of Fab\u2019 Fragments</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The fragment antigen-binding (Fab\u2019) is a region on the antibody that binds to the antigen. It consists of a single heavy chain and light chain. To create a Fab\u2019 fragment-secreting hybridoma using CRISPR/HDR, the team selected NLDC-145, a hybridoma clone that secretes mAbs of rat IgG2a (rIgG2a) isotype. The antigen of rIgG2a is DEC205, an endocytic receptor found on immune cells. The team electroporated NLDC-145 cells with Cas9 and an appropriate guide RNA to induce double-strand breaks at the hinge region; to repair the double-strand break, they designed an HDR Fab\u2019 donor construct for homology-directed repair. The HDR Fab\u2019 donor construct also inserts specific tags onto the protein, allowing for easy purification of the Fab\u2019 fragment.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To test secretion of the Fab\u2019 fragment, they stained JAWSII, a DEC205-expressing cell line, with the supernatants of NLDC-145 clones that had undergone CRISPR/HDR. Flow cytometry assays showed that a large portion of Fab\u2019-secreting hybridomas were successfully created. Further assays showed that the secreted Fab\u2019 fragments retained their binding capabilities. It is worth noting that the researchers also used the same strategy to convert other hybridoma lines to become recombinant, Fab\u2019-producing lines, with similar success; this demonstrates that this engineering technique is flexible and not just limited to one cell line (1).</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>The Generation of Isotype Panels</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a similar manner to creating monoclonal Fab\u2019-generating hybridomas, the team also used the one-step CRISPR/HDR technique to create hybridomas capable of producing a wide array of isotype variants for the same mAb. This time, the cell line subject was hybridoma MIH5, which secretes monoclonal rIgG2a that targets mouse PD-L1, an immune checkpoint protein. The goal was to make clones of MIH5 to each produce one isotype of the chimeric (having both rat and mouse-related parts) monoclonal antibodies: mIgG1, mIgG2a, mIgG2b, mIgG3, mIgA, and a mutant form of mIgG2a (mIgG2a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">silent</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MIH5 cells were cotransfected (introduced with DNA) with a Cas9 vector containing the appropriate guide RNA and a construct from a panel of isotype HDR donor constructs (each isotype had its own unique HDR donor construct). Following knock-in integration, flow cytometry analysis showed that the engineered chimeric mAbs were successfully secreted. Thus, the creation of recombinant hybridomas for a panel of isotypes was successfully engineered (1). This invention allows for the creation of monoclonal antibodies with different Fc regions, providing researchers an easy way to \u201ccustomize\u201d their antibodies to elicit a specific response from the immune system. Researchers may choose which isotype variant they want on their antibody, which is fully dependent on their target (antigen) of interest and how the immune system behaves towards it. This has vast potential in antibody-based therapeutics, in that this system can be used for the optimization of potential drugs to become more potent and dynamic.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Biochemical Applications</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To test the functional capability of isotype-switched mAbs, Schoot and colleagues tested the antibodies\u2019 capability to induce an important immune mechanism: antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In order to test ADCC in vitro, mouse colon adenocarcinoma cells were labeled with chromium-51, and then taken in by MIH5 Fc isotype variants. After adding whole blood, they measured chromium-51 release. On the other hand, B cell depletion by MIH5 Fc variants was used to measure ADCC in in vivo experiments. Analyses of these studies show that chimeric mAbs created by CRISPR/HDR hybridomas have the same biochemical and immune effector characteristics as their recombinant and naturally occurring counterparts (1). Something to highlight is that instead of treading through the laborious process of producing\u00a0 recombinant antibodies in the conventional way (often consisting of multiple rounds of optimized sequencing, cloning, transfection), this one-step mechanism grants smooth and rapid generation of recombinant antibodies that perform their expected functions (1).</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The ability to create monoclonal antibodies with the freedom to choose what goes on their constant regions possess many applications in the vast field of medicine and engineering. Being able to construct a very specific monoclonal antibody (the engineering element) that stimulates the immune system in a certain, beneficial way (the medical component) intertwines the two fields together to propel us closer towards treating diseases more efficiently and effectively. This system also represents an optimized version of recombinant engineering, which saves valuable time and funds that can be used towards conducting further studies. A simple, yet powerful and flexible approach, this versatile CRISPR/HDR platform aims to facilitate antibody engineering and research for the scientific community, and is accelerating the rate at which new clinical trials can be performed.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Schoot, J.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n<p><h4>By\u00a0Aditi Goyal,\u00a0Genetics and Genomics, \u201822</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At this moment, the next revolution in the field of biology is currently underway: third-generation sequencing, or Long-Read sequencing. Instead of relying on cluster-based short read technology (1), third-generation sequencing builds a DNA sequence on a nucleotide basis, therefore eliminating the extensive process of read alignment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Until now, scientists across the world have been heavily relying on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for getting DNA sequences. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This technology creates clusters of short DNA sequences, which range anywhere from 50 to 150 base pairs in length, by using fluorescent nucleotides (2).</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It is often referred to as sequencing by synthesis because a DNA sequence is created by tracking which nucleotides are being used to build the parallel strand. NGS has served the scientific community well, providing extremely high coverage and high accuracy reads, as well as slashing the cost and time to sequence an entire genome (2). However, the drawbacks are just as serious. While NGS is a fantastic candidate for bacterial or archaeal genomes, it fails to capture the complexity of eukaryotic genomes. About half of the human genome is comprised of repeated sequences (2). Currently, the function of these repeated regions remains unclear, partially due to the fact that it is not possible to get an accurate DNA sequence of these areas using short-read sequences. With a maximum read size of 150 base pairs for NGS, there are too many potential matches for a read that small for scientists to accurately assign that read to a region in the genome. Another major problem is the quality of each read. While the technology itself is very accurate, there are several sources of error that quickly cause the quality of each read to deteriorate, such as biases during the PCR of mixtures, polymerase errors, base misincorporation, cluster amplification errors, sequencing cycle errors, and incorrect image analysis (3). All these errors result in about 1% of bases being read incorrectly, which, when applied to a 3 billion base pair genome, can be incredibly damaging.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is why long-read sequencing is such a breakthrough. By analyzing a DNA sequence from nucleotide to nucleotide, scientists can build considerably longer reads with a much higher confidence level as compared to NGS. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ideally, with this technology, scientists will be able to produce de novo whole genome sequences for patients with genetic disorders, allowing them to understand the root of their disease at an unmatched resolution. This could pave the way to accurately diagnosing and curing complex genetic diseases. In the last few years alone, several papers have been published on the impacts of long-read sequencing investigating diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, fragile X syndrome, Alzheimers, and ALS (11). Other applications include improving our understanding of human genetic diversity.\u00a0 Recent studies show that the reference human genomes available today do not accurately represent humanity at a global level, but rather significantly overrepresent people of european descent (12). With the rise of long-read sequencing, it will be easier and cheaper to fully sequence a human genome, allowing us to expand the resources available and accurately reflect the human population.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are currently several companies researching long-read sequencing, however, the most promising company appears to be Pacific Biosciences (Pac Bio) due to their development of single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT) (4, 5).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are 2 key inventions that allow for the success of SMRT. The first is the fluorescent tagging.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like with NGS, each nucleotide is modified to fluoresce a certain color, indicating which nucleotide it is, however with SMRT, the fluorescence is linked to the terminal phosphate of a nucleotide, instead of the base itself (8). Also similar to the NGS, the complementary strand continues to build. Now, when the DNA polymerase cleaves off the terminal phosphate, it releases the fluorescent group, which allows us to track which nucleotide was incorporated based on the color of the fluorescent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The second innovation is the zero-mode waveguide (ZMW). The ZMW is a small nano chamber that contains the DNA sample during the sequencing process. It passes refracted light through so that the fluorescence of the nucleotides can be seen. This technology essentially acts as a microscope, allowing us to gain a powerful resolution of the DNA structure. Each ZMW can recognize over 10 base pairs per second with extreme accuracy. Additionally, given the ability for these ZMWs to be run in parallel, thousands of chambers can be sequenced at the same time, allowing for a fast cycle and long reads.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The advantages of SMRT are clear: it allows for long reads to be built. This means that scientists will have the ability to understand the overall complexity of large eukaryotic genomes. Another advantage is the speed and portability of the technology. Once it is completely developed, SMRT will be able to sequence an entire human genome in under 3 minutes for less than $100 in a device the size of a flash drive, a stark difference from today\u2019s estimate (9).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Like any novel technology, there are some challenges that must be overcome before SMRT can be used commercially. The most pressing is concerns over accuracy. Individual reads can contain 11-14% errors on average, dragging the quality score of the read down. However, developers have noticed that these errors occur at random across the genome. By using a 10x coverage method, 9 out of 10 times, SMRT will provide the correct sequence for that point, which allows the accuracy to rise to approximately 99.99%.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Overall, SMRT is a revolutionary development that will soon change the way we understand biology. It will allow us to gain a holistic understanding of complex eukaryotic genome and will provide a higher resolution of the genome that we can use for further analysis.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cIllumina Sequencing Technology.\u201d Illumina, October 11, 2010. https://www.illumina.com/documents/products/techspotlights/techspotlight_sequencing.pdf.</li>\n<li>Treangen, Todd J, and Steven L Salzberg. \u201cRepetitive DNA and next-Generation Sequencing: Computational Challenges and Solutions.\u201d Nature reviews.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As an undergraduate studying genetics and genomics and computer science, I wanted to interview a former professor to find out the steps he took in order to do computational research in the biological sciences. I was interested in finding out more about the growing field of computational biology and wanted to help shed light on a field to students that may be similarly interested.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Background</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You received a Bachelors in Math, then a masters in Biochemistry, then a PhD in Computer Science; did you always know that you wanted to do research in biology? If so, what made you want to start off with a technical education rather than something traditional like biology or chemistry? If not, how did you come to discover applications of computer science in Biology even 15 years ago?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">No, I did not start off wanting to do anything related to biology. I started my undergrad thinking I would make computer games. How I kind of got into this was a week before my undergrad, I got an email from my university asking if I wanted to be a part of the first cohort of a bioinformatics program. I initially declined.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As I was looking for my third internship in my co-op program, I had a friend who found a job for a professor in Toronto, and my friend asked if I wanted to work on this cool project about predicting how proteins fold into these 3D structures. I told him I don\u2019t know anything about protein structures, but sure! It was a lot of fun.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is that what inspired you to pursue Biochemistry for further education?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think that first internship was very pivotal, because it really nurtured my interest in protein structures. When I finished my undergrad, I was kind of bored of computer science, which is why I thought I would do a PhD studying protein structures.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How do you see life sciences research evolving and progressing in the coming years, given the inclusion of this new field?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In my opinion, we will see more and more blurring of boundaries. In 25 years, there is going to be more undergraduate programs less defined by walls like \u201clife sciences,\u201d \u201cchemistry,\u201d and better recognition that everybody borrows knowledge and skills from many fields. It will be very difficult to do a life sciences degree without learning anything about math or statistics. Similarly, more people in traditional quantitative disciplines will want to take those classes in the life sciences. Essentially there will be fewer walls.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How would undergraduates studying quantitative subjects, like mathematics, statistics, or computer science be made aware of the growing demand for such skills in the Life Sciences?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The classic way to become introduced to such areas would be through coursework, internship with a company, or research with a professor. The last two ways are not very optimal. At the end of the day, in a standard undergraduate program, you have summers, and if you are ambitious you can try to do research during the school year. However, you can only do so many different kinds of internships before you graduate. If you did one every summer of college, and even two before hand, even that would not be sufficient for getting a nice, representative sample for all the things you can work on.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That is where</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">universities need to do a better job of creating opportunities for students to engage with people from industry and research so that they don\u2019t need 4-5 months to figure many essential things out.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Research and Beyond</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Can you briefly describe some of the research that your lab does?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are currently working towards a few different directions. A large project at the moment is studying the genetics of mental disorders and neurodegeneration, for example we look at the genetics of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, schizophrenia, autism, etc. Our main goal is to mechanistically understand how genetic variants associated with these mental conditions modify disease risk. Much of those mechanistic studies currently look at events that happen at the molecular level. This is great and very useful; however, since the majority of the research is geared at the molecular level we don\u2019t have a good understanding of what variants do functionally at the level of the cell. How does it affect the functional properties of the cell, such as neuron electrophysiology? Or, how is the organization of the tissue affected?\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other areas we work on are on building better models to understand how cells are spatially\u00a0 organized in the brain, as well as building models that quantitatively describe cell population behavior. We know that cells behave differently when put into different contexts. It\u2019s of interest to build a model to predict what happens when you put together different kinds of cells in different combinations, orientations, or conditions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lastly, a third project being worked on is on the therapeutic end. We are essentially trying to identify the druggable region of the genome. There are a lot of computational problems in trying to determine what is druggable.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How do you think the integration of the computational sciences has shed light on how biological processes are interconnected, and what do they make clear that a molecular approach may not be able to?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In human genetics, computational models play a huge role in hypothesis generation. They do a good job leveraging big data, such as genomics, to prioritize which variants should be tested using molecular approaches, for example, when molecular approaches are costly or too slow to systematically test many variants across a genome. The role of computation is parsing through the many possibilities that you can\u2019t explore molecularly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, a study we worked on four years ago was to try and find a causal variant for obesity. Most human genetic studies only point to a region of the genome where causal variants might hide, but don\u2019t tell you exactly which one is the true causal one. When these regions are big, like hundreds of kilobases long, you need computational tools to identify the precise causal one to test experimentally. In that study, computational tools played the pivotal role of identifying the causal variant that was ultimately tested and shown to drive large changes in obesity risk.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How does computational research like your own lead to the progression of curated care in the health industry?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At a superficial level, in some ways it accelerates some of the biomedical discoveries that are being done today. The obesity study is one example. If you didn\u2019t have the computational resources, you would spend years and years trying to find the right variant. However, we found it relatively quickly with computation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For healthcare specifically, fields such as machine learning are revolutionizing care today. People from statistics, computer science, and math are working directly with clinicians and hospitals to develop highly accurate \u2018digital pathology\u2019 software, they help predict when patients will need to come into the hospital or whether they are high risk for a disease.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oftentimes, conditions and diseases are misdiagnosed, which leads to inappropriate treatments. How would research in this area begin to remedy this common problem in the healthcare industry?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most diseases are heterogeneous, which means that a group of people who are diagnosed with the same condition might actually have different underlying conditions, and need different treatments. Many computational approaches based on molecular and clinical data are being developed to identify more homogeneous groups of patients, to help achieve precision medicine. This allows for the most accurate prescription of medication and treatments. This is because these homogenous groups help identify the underlying disease phenotype which means access to better directed medication.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During your time as a PhD student, you also \u201cexplored the application of models built from deconvolving gene expression profiles, for personalized medicine.\u201d Can you go more in depth to how these models were built and how it can advance our ability to provide a more accurate prognosis to patients?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During my PhD, we were trying to predict the prognosis of early stage lung cancer patients. If you are diagnosed with early stage lung cancer say stage 1B, clinicians have to make important decisions, such as how much e.g. chemotherapy to give you. If they give you too much, it will get rid of the primary tumor, but you will increase your risk of recurrence. But if you don\u2019t give enough, you don\u2019t get rid of the primary tumor.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back then, fourteen year ago or so, genome expression profiling was just becoming popular. People were thinking maybe we can predict whether these stage 1B patients were going to be at high risk of recurrence or not. Our motivation for that problem was essentially to build a computational model to predict based on molecular signatures if they should be given extra therapy or not. That in itself is a hard problem. Additionally, before single cell sequencing was available, it was hard to take a sample of a tumor and only sequence the tumor cells. Often times you would have contamination of normal cells that would mess up the signatures you would get. We had to develop a computational method to extract out only the signatures due to tumor cells, and show that once you do that it is much easier to predict prognosis.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where do you think research will be in the next 10-20 years?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are going to see a lot more connections across more previously isolated fields. For example, with respect to human psychiatric genetics, a lot of focus right now is at the molecular impact of genetic variants, but in the near future I\u2019d expect there to be much closer integration with clinicians to also study the impact on behavior, and with the experimental biologists to study the impact on brain development and organization.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">***Special thanks to Dr. Gerald Quon for this interview</span></i></p>\n</div>"

However, the general public has offered little attention towards the use of this engineering feat in a broader ecological system. Upon watching the new Netflix original </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Un</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">natural Selection</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, discussion of considering the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in New Zealand\u2019s effort to completely eradicate invasive species piqued my interest. The following article is an exploration of CRISPR/Cas9 prospect into New Zealand\u2019s bold environmental pursuit and its potential ecological impact.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since it has become feasible to cross oceans to reach unforeseeable land masses, invasive alien species (IAS) are an increasing threat to international biodiversity. Moreover, no other region faces as great of a peril as New Zealand (NZ), which holds the record as the nation </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">with the highest survival rate of threatened avifauna (birds of a particular region) species</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[5]. In 2012, New Zealand physicist Sir Paul Callaghan introduced a large-scale eradication program to permanently remove eight invasive mammalian predators (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rodents: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus rattus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus norvegicus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus exulans</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mus musculus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; mustelids: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela furo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela erminea</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela nivalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; and the common brushtail possum: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Trichosurus vulpecula</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) [5]. Four years after this grand proposal, the NZ government committed to a national challenge titled \u201cPredator Free 2050\u201d (PF 2050) to pursue this audacious goal.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Approximately 85 million years ago, NZ was one of the first landmasses to split from the supercontinent Gondwana and as it shifted away, it did not carry mammals until bats flew and aquatic species swam to this island. [7]. With the introduction of rodent species initially through Polynesian settlement some 750 years ago and thereafter European seafaring ventures, the endemic species of NZ have been left vulnerable to novel predators. Consequently, at least 51 native bird species that have evolved adaptive skills of remaining close to the ground have been unsuccessful at surviving alongside these rodent predator species [4]. These invasive omnivorous rodents prey on birds, eggs, seeds, snails, lizards, and fruits. As a result, their varied diets prompt competition with the native fauna, further placing pressure on their vulnerable survival [7]. Despite CRISPR/Cas9 modifications offering the greatest potential in gene drive to eliminate these unwanted predators, several techniques implemented to control these invasive populations,\u00a0 such as pesticides, trapping innovations, and biological factors have given favorable results.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Past Successes and Future Endeavors</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For decades, the NZ government has pursued eradication initiatives to permanently eliminate foreign invasive species on small local islands. Through concerted efforts, several of these projects have proven successful in the restoration of the natural biodiversity this island nation boasts.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In June of 2009, the NZ Department of Conservation (DOC) undertook a multi-action plan to simultaneously eradicate rodent, rabbit, stout, hedgehog, and cat species in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rangitoto and Motutapu islands. After three years of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">aerial dispersion of anticoagulant Pestoff 20R</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TM</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> combined with trapping and indicator dogs, the island witnessed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">total elimination of the islands\u2019 stoats and four rodent species; declination of rabbit and hedgehog population by 96%; and over 50% reduction in cats [7].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite these successful feats, the invasive species fecundity and ability to adapt to these challenges still present an overwhelming challenge to reach the goal of complete eradication. Recently, more direct approaches delving into novel genetic inheritance techniques have been explored to serve as a potential permanent solution. Termed the\u201cTrojan Female Technique\u201d (TFT), the method makes use of the correlation of sperm fitness dependence on the abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [2]. Healthy sperm is dependent on sufficient mitochondrial level for energy production to manage motility and fertilization. For example, experiments conducted on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drosophila melanogaster</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> supports the causation of reduced spermatogenesis and sperm maturation due to induced mutations in cytochrome mitochondrial gene [9]. Contrasting female eggs, the asymmetric greater dependence of sperm on mtDNA for normal functionality results in only male populations to be the sole source of target. Induction of mitochondrial mutations in females to compromise total sperm viability in future male progenies will serve as an effective control to population growth.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although seemingly promising, TFT is not guaranteed to completely eradicate propagation for several reasons. For starters, males with impaired fertility can still provide sufficient sperm count to fertilize eggs on a population-based scale. Furthermore, in circumstances where females do receive nonviable sperm count, they can still seek adequate functioning sperm through matings with other males. On a larger scale, should the mutation pervade, selection pressures could still inadvertently choose for nuclear modifications to make up for the mitochondrial defects [2]. These flaws raise the need for more pervasive and permanent resolutions.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Daisy Chain Crispr Gene Drive</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The recent biochemical breakthrough underpinning the ability to effectively and precisely modify genes with CRISPR/Cas9 has allowed for potential biotechnology to boom in the realm of ecology. The simple generation of a short RNA sequence into a virus or bacterium to serve as a vector, guides the cutting mechanism of Cas9 to specific regions in the genome to be excised, prompting for these double stranded breaks to be fixed through DNA repair mechanisms. While these fixtures can potentially repair the gene, it can also raise the possibility for the gene to be disabled, introduce a new function, or create an unforeseen mutation. Given the right specific targeting in the germ line, this approach houses the innovation for exterminating entire species through gene drive [6].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The mechanism behind gene drive overthrows the traditional Mendelian sexual reproduction concept of proportional contribution from both the male and female parent. The power comes from the ability of one genetically modified (GM) contributor encoding for the \u2018gene drive\u2019 to cut the other set of chromosomes lacking these genes and replace this excision with a self-replicating copy. In effect, this divisive modification would push for an otherwise heterozygous offspring from a wild-type mating with a GM partner to become homozygous for certain genes to be carried on and propagated by future generations. Given that these genetic alterations do not affect the fitness of the organism, dissemination of 1% of the population with CRISPR modified genes can lead to 99% of the local population carrying the genetic indicator in as little as nine generations (The use of gene editing to create gene drives for pest control in New Zealand).</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2752 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"62\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-300x62.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-230x47.png 230w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-300x62.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-350x72.png 350w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-480x99.png 480w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-768x158.png 768w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-830x171.png 830w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-1024x211.png 1024w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed.png 1183w\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Such a unilateral approach poses political and ethical challenges amongst neighboring nations with diverging ecological approaches to confront pest control. Should this pervasive gene drive program reach beyond its intended border, great difficulty would arise in maintaining this ecological enclosure. For example, possum is on the list of invasive species in NZ while just 2,500 miles west, its neighbor Australia keeps this species of marsupials under protection. As such, scientists have devised a simple model to localize gene alterations, coined The Daisy Chain.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2751 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"243\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-300x243.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-230x187.png 230w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-300x243.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-350x284.png 350w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2.png 439w\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike the original gene drive method in which all components necessary for transformation (CRISPR, edited DNA, and guide RNAs) are provided on the same chromosome, Daisy Chain provides a self-exhaustive means of guaranteeing genetic edits. This tool is designed so that\u00a0 each component required for genetic alteration is dependent on the presence of a different element upstream on the gene found on the same locus to be activated [8]. The most downstream portion of this chain contains the \u201cload\u201d of engineered dominant lethal genes preventing reproduction, which will be promoted to higher frequency in the population within several generations. For instance, should an engineered allele contain three elements A, B, and C, element C would render element B to drive, which will in turn cause element A carrying the final load to drive. The initial element (C in this case) does not actually drive, thus is restricted by the number of altered individuals released into the wild and will be lost via natural selection over time. During initial implementation, the presence of C will increase B in abundance, but B will eventually decline and finally disappear as C is lost in the population. The rapid rise in abundance of B will also cause A to increase in frequency within the local population; however, with the decrease of B, A would not be driven and will ultimately vanish as well [1]. Using MIT Professor Esvelt\u2019s analogy, \u201c\u2026 the elements of a daisy drive system are similar to booster stages of a genetic rocket: those at the bottom of the base of the daisy-chain help life the payload until they run out of fuel and are successively lost.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Challenges with Daisy Chain Crispr Gene Drive</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CRISPR/Cas9 technology\u2019s ability to potentially alter these invasive species\u2019 fecundity provides an avenue of pursuing NZ\u2019s goal of PF 2050. Despite the developed understanding of how to carry out this plan, scientists in NZ are still working to piece together the genomes of stoats and possums in order to understand where to properly facilitate the engineered RNA sequence. Other barriers that must be acknowledged are the unprecedented approach to genetically modify marsupials and the difficulty of implanting hundreds to thousands of oocytes to be dispersed amongst their population.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond these known difficulties, scientists still tread in unknown terrains pertaining to whether these mutations can have pernicious effects in the survival, health, and reproductive success in propagating these mutations within their populations. Further exploration into the development of these modifications, and the potential impacts they can have on these animals, must be investigated on model organisms prior to widespread use.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of the eight listed mammalian species vied to be permanently eradicated from NZ, Mus musculus holds the most promise, given the extensive knowledge of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mus musculus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> genome. With the help of scientists outside of New Zealand, joining in on the efforts to identify which germline gene to focus on, this project has received international attention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although the daisy drive provides promising potential, research collaborators at MIT and Harvard have identified a possible risk of, \u201c\u2026 DNA encoding a drive component from one element to another, thereby creating a \u2018daisy necklace\u2019 capable of a global drive\u201d [1]. Due to this rare recombinatory event arising from the similarity of DNA sequences, these investigators have looked into circumventing the problem by creating numerous alternatives to CRISPR components and selecting the model with the greatest diversity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From their renowned aviary to reptilian species, New Zealand\u2019s islandic geographical region houses some of the most biodiverse fauna known to man. The arrival of human settlement has introduced predatory species, causing endemic species to experience extinction at concerning rates [4]. With the purpose of preserving their unique remaining diversity, New Zealand has committed to concerted efforts of varying methods to eradicate these invasive vertebrate pests. Investigation into genetic modifications can provide for more expansive and thorough techniques to eliminate these human introduced pests and allow for these endangered species to thrive once again. By further exploring daisy chain CRISPR/Cas9, this effort can be genetically inherited by offspring, allowing for nature to carry out this effort. As opposed to continued efforts of targeting each individual one by one, conservation ecologists can borrow from molecular biologist\u2019s toolkit to revolutionize the means of pursuing pest control and perhaps even pave the road for future endeavors with similar pursuits.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Esvelt, Kevin M. \u201cDaisy Drives.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sculpting Evolution</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, www.sculptingevolution.org/daisydrives.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gemmell, Neil J., et al. \u201cThe Trojan Female Technique: a Novel, Effective and Humane Approach for Pest Population Control.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 280, no. 1773, 2013, pp. 1\u20136., doi:10.1098/rspb.2013.2549.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Griffiths, Richard, et al. \u201cSuccessful Eradication of Invasive Vertebrates on Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands, New Zealand.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Biological Invasions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 17, no. 5, 2014, pp. 1355\u20131369., doi:10.1007/s10530-014-0798-7.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Owens, Brian. \u201cThe Big Cull: Can New Zealand Pull off an Audacious Plan to Get Rid of Invasive Predators by 2050?\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nature</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 541, 12 Jan. 2017, pp. 148\u2013150.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Russell, James C., John G.

While not detracting from the great advances being made in the field currently this piece is to take stock of the reality of this treatment.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Large segments of the American and world population living with medical\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">conditions that cause significant loss of mobility and quality of life are searching for\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">hope in Stem Cell therapy.\u00a0 The unfortunate reality is that many of these \u201ctherapies\u201d are not only ineffective but potentially harmful and the clinics that distribute them are not always properly certified. While stem cell therapies are promising, run away hope for a miracle cure coupled with unethical advertising and untested procedures have caused patients in the United States and beyond to be harmed by a potentially life saving tool. Here we will examine the current state of stem cell investigation, treatment, US Regulation, prospects in the future of medicine, and information for consumers to consider in deciding to receive a stem cell treatment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stem cells are undifferentiated cells that are at the start of all cell lines. Embryonic stem cells come from the blastocyst, a small clump of cells that forms several days after conception, and are pluripotent, meaning that they can give rise to any cell type (except specific\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">embryonic tissues not present out of utero). [1] While these are the most often referred to\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">type of stem cells there are also multipotent stem cells that can only give rise to a specific\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">kind of tissue and are present into adulthood. Somatic cells, or differentiated cells, can be\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reverted to a pluripotent state. Induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS) are a growing area of\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">interest in the field as they carry with them the possibility of culturing tissues for transplant\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">using the existing cells of a patient thus eliminating the possibility of rejection.[2]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">IPS exemplify an unfortunate reality in the whole of stem cell research, that at\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">present widespread stem cell therapies are not ready for the general public. While these cells have great potential, a major hurdle is the cost in both time and labor required to culture them in a safe and sterile environment. A single vial of research grade cells that will produce fewer than thirty colonies in five days under ideal circumstances can cost over 1,000 dollars. This does not include the cost of facilities, culture equipment, and labor making these therapies cost prohibitive as the resulting therapy can run as far as 10,000 dollars per treatment. [3&amp;4] Furthermore, colonies of cells are far from fully developed tissues that could potentially be implanted. A patient in critical condition in need of a transplant likely cannot wait for the cells to grow into tissue in culture, even if they can afford it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Difficulties in access however are not the greatest barrier to stem cell therapy, but rather the lack of widespread testing and approval for the treatment of the diverse conditions for which they are sometimes advertised.\u00a0 While these cells are promising for usage in widespread areas of medicine, at present they do not live up to the claims that many unscrupulous clinics make for them. US Stem Cell Clinic, with a sleek website, and moving testimonials, advertises the use of stem cells as a magical cure that make the old feel young again using stem cells to treat a host of orthopedic maladies. These claims are highly suspicious as the FDA website says, as of January 2019, that only stem cell therapies for blood disorders are approved. [5]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These cells have been proclaimed cure-alls and medical miracles by the mass media but the reality is that the research into the application of stem cells for diverse ailments in humans is not conclusive at the present moment. [5]\u00a0 The FDA only approves stem cell treatments for blood disorders using stem cells from umbilical cord blood or bone marrow, but many clinics are offering stem cell treatments for everything from vision problems to COPD. The FDA recently filed two complaints against US Stem Cell Clinic LLC in Florida and California Stem Cell Treatment Inc. for marketing stem cell products that do not have the proper approval and for having unsafe manufacturing conditions that compromised sterility and patient safety. Patients filed lawsuits against California based stem cell supplier Liveyon who sold umbilical cord stem cells contaminated with E. Coli that resulted in sepsis and several patient hospitalizations after the stem cells were used for unapproved treatments. [6]\u00a0 In a recent lawsuit Florida based US Stem Cell was ordered to cease and desist, destroy all stem cells in their possession and pay for twice annual facilities inspections after taking cells from fat and injecting them into the eyes of patients causing five women to be blinded. In a 2018 statement FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. said \u201cWe support sound, scientific research and regulation of cell-based regenerative medicine, and the FDA has advanced a comprehensive policy framework to promote the approval of regenerative medicine products. But at the same time, the FDA will continue to take enforcement actions against clinics that abuse the trust of patients and endanger their health\u201d [7] The FDA, has in the past been accused of slowing down progress with novel treatments, but in the case of stem cells it is apparent that their actions hold patient safety as first priority, protecting the public from doctors and companies that value monetization over public health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patients in the United States have been harmed by these clinics including adverse injection site reactions, migration of cells to the improper location, the failure of cells to work in the desired way, and even the growth of tumors. Clinics that operate these studies may even be operating criminally as the FDA has pressed charges against these clinics in the past in the form of permanent injunction, an order to cease and desist permanently. [7]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Patients are often motivated to take these risky treatments because there is no other hope for a cure, however, unapproved treatments can make the condition worse or even lead to death. The dangers of receiving unapproved therapies is illustrated in the case of a 38-year-old\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">man, who developed a spinal tumor after a stem cell treatment in preformed in Portugal\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">where doctors injected cells taken from his nose into his spine. The treatment was attempting to cure paralysis in his legs and arms. It had no effect on his paralysis, but twelve years later the tumor that formed further limited his mobility and quality of life as his bladder control and motor function in arms steadily declined. Complications have been even more dire as a thirteen-year-old male in Israel who was treated at a clinic in Moscow for Ataxia telangiectasia, which affects the nervous system, died of a tumor that arose from donor cells. These are not isolated instances of unsuccessful treatment in patients that were already ill, the stem cells themselves were directly the cause of degeneration in the patients, and more than 19 deaths confirmed by the National Institute of Health as of 2018. [8&amp;9]</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Predatory clinics that perform these unapproved procedures can be especially hard to identify. Many have sleek well-designed websites with official looking personnel and lofty claims of unrealistic success rates and propositions for stem cells as cures for many diverse and at times totally unrelated disorders. Many clinics are located in Florida and Southern California however there are hundreds of clinics across the United States.\u00a0 [10]*** Patients should be advised to do some research into these claims and check to see if the clinic in question as well as the treatment has FDA approval. A good strategy for determining the legitimacy of a clinic is to do research on the main doctors performing the procedure. If a clinic is claiming to be able to cure numerous unrelated and debilitating disorders, the doctors performing these procedures should be of high esteem in the community and have visible external measures to the importance of their work or the prestige of their practice. If this is not the case the patient should proceed with great caution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The issue of deceptive stem cell clinics is not a mere issue of public health but an example of a greater problem, a break between scientific community and the public perpetuated by a few unscrupulous characters for the sake of profit. Stem cells have the potential to be life saving tools and usher in a whole new chapter of regenerative medicine, but if the reputation of this technology continues to be tarnished by clinics that do not abide by the laws and conventions put in place to keep consumers safe, this technology may never get an opportunity to reach its full potential.While stem cells have great potential for diverse treatments at some point in\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the future, at present their efficacy and safety for regenerative medicine has not been firmly established in the context of current technology. Not all stem cell treatments are to be feared, stem cell treatments for some blood disorders have been shown to be effective and safe. At some point in the future when culture and delivery techniques improve stem cells could revolutionize transplant and regenerative medicine.\u00a0 At present the best course of action for consumers in regard to these therapies is to partake only in treatments or clinical trials operating with the approval of the FDA, and keep up with developments in the field by reading peer reviewed papers published in reputable journals. Exercise great caution but do not lose hope for the future. Stay current with research and, considering the risks and benefits, consumers may choose to enroll in FDA supervised clinical trials that adhere to the three phase clinical trial process, but always be sure to exclusively receive treatment from FDA regulated and approved clinicians.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Sources</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yu, Junying, and James Thomson. \u201cEmbryonic Stem Cells.\u201d</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">National Institutes of Health</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2016, stemcells.nih.gov/info/Regenerative_Medicine/2006Chapter1.htm.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cHome.\u201d A Closer Look at Stem Cells, www.closerlookatstemcells.org/learn-about-stem-cells/types-of-stem-cells/.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">McCormack, Kevin. \u201cPatients Beware: Warnings about Shady Clinics and Suspect Treatments.\u201d The Stem Cellar,\u00a0</span>CRIM, 19 Jan. 2016, blog.cirm.ca.gov/2016/01/19/patients-beware-warnings-about-shady-clinics-and-suspect- treatments/.</li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://www.atcc.org/search?title=Human%20IPS%20(Pluripotent)#q=%40productline%3DL035&amp;amp;sort=relevancy&amp;amp;f:contentTypeFacetATCC=[Products]</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Office of the Commissioner. \u201cConsumer Updates \u2013 FDA Warns About Stem Cell Therapies.\u201d U S Food and DrugAdministration Home Page, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 16 Nov. 2016, </span><a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm286155.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm286155.htm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">William Wan, Laurie McGinley. \u201c\u2019Miraculous\u2019 Stem Cell Therapy Has Sickened People in Five States.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Washington Post</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, WP Company, 27 Feb. 2019, www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/miraculous-stem-cell-therapy-has-sickened-people-in-five-states/2019/02/26/c04b23a4-3539-11e9-854a-7a14d7fec96a_story.html.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Commissioner, Office of the. \u201cFDA Seeks Permanent Injunctions against Two Stem Cell Clinics.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, FDA, 9 May 2018, www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-seeks-permanent-injunctions-against-two-stem-cell-clinics.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bauer, Gerhard, et al. \u201cConcise Review: A Comprehensive Analysis of Reported Adverse Events in Patients Receiving Unproven Stem Cell-Based Interventions.\u201d Stem Cells Translational Medicine, John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons, Inc., Sept. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127222/#!po=19.4444\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127222/#!po=19.4444</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flaherty, Brittany, et al. \u201cCase Highlights the Risks of Experimental Stem Cell Therapy.\u201d STAT, Staten News, 11 July 2019, </span><a href=\"http://www.statnews.com/2019/07/11/canada-case-long-term-risks-experimental-stem-cell-therapy/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.statnews.com/2019/07/11/canada-case-long-term-risks-experimental-stem-cell-therapy/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://usstemcellclinic.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://usstemcellclinic.com/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [10]</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Commissioner, Office of the. \u201cStep 3: Clinical Research.\u201d U.S. Food and Drug Administration,\u00a0</span>FDA , 4 Jan. 2018, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-\">www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-</a>research.</li>\n<li>Hiltznik, Micheal. \u201cColumn: Judge Throws the Book at a Clinic Offering Unproven Stem Cell \u2018Treatments\u2019.\u201d <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Los Angeles Times, 26 June 2019, www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-stem-cell-injunction-20190626-story.html.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4> I wrote about this topic after being introduced to the idea through a speaker series. I think the applications of modern day computer science, genetics and statistics creates a fascinating crossroads between these academic fields, and the applications are simply astounding.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the field of clinical genomics and diagnostic genetic tests. Now that sequencing technologies can be easily accessed and results can be obtained relatively quickly, several scientists and companies are relying on this technology to learn more about genetic variation. There is just one problem: magnitude. NGS and other genome sequencing methods generate data sets in the size of billions. As a result, simple pairwise comparisons of genetic data that have served scientists well in the past, cannot be applied in a meaningful manner to these data sets [1]. Consequently, in efforts to make sense of these data sets, artificial intelligence (AI), also known as deep learning or machine learning, has introduced itself to the biological sciences. Using AI, and its adaptive nature, scientists can design algorithms aimed to identify meaningful patterns within genomes and to highlight key variations. Ideally, with a large enough learning data set, and with a powerful enough computer,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> AI will be able to pick out significant genetic variations like markers for different types of cancer, multi-gene mutations that contribute to complex diseases like diabetes, and essentially provide geneticists with the information they need to eradicate these diseases, before they manifest in the patient.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The formal definition for AI is simply \u201cthe capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior\u201d [2]. But what exactly does that imply? The key feature of AI is simply that it is able to make decisions, much like a human would, based on previous knowledge and the results from past decisions. AI algorithms are designed to take in information, generate patterns from that information, and apply it to new data, about which we know very little about. Using its adaptive strategies, AI is able to \u201clearn as it goes,\u201d by fine-tuning its decision-making process with every new piece of data provided to it, eventually making it the ultimate decision-making tool. While this may sound highly futuristic, AI has been used for several years in applications throughout our daily lives from the self-driving cars being tested in the Silicon Valley, to the voice recognition program available on every smartphone today. Most chess fans will remember the iconic \u201cDeep Blue vs Kasparov\u201d match, where Carnegie Mellon students developed an IBM supercomputer using a basic AI algorithm designed to compete against the reigning chess champion of the world [3]. Back then, in 1997, this algorithm was revolutionary, as it was one of the major signs that AI was on par with human intelligence. [4]. Obviously, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">there is no question that AI has immense potential to be applied in the field of genomics.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before we can begin to understand what AI can do, it is important to understand how AI works. Generally speaking, there are two ways AI algorithms are developed: supervised and unsupervised learning. The key difference between the two groups is that in supervised learning, the data sets we provide to AI to \u201clearn\u201d are data sets that we have already analyzed and understand. In other words, we already know what the output will be, before providing it to AI [5]. The goal, therefore, is for the AI algorithm to generate an output as close to our prior knowledge as possible. Eventually, by using larger and more complex data sets, the algorithm will have modified itself enough to the point where it does the job of the data scientist, but is capable of doing so on a much larger scale. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, does not have a set output predefined. So, in a sense, the user is learning along with the algorithm. This technique is useful when we want to find patterns or define clusters within our data set without predefining what those patterns or clusters will be. For the purposes of genomic studies, scientists use unsupervised learning patterns to analyze their data sets. This is beneficial over supervised learning, since the gigantic data sets produced by omics studies are difficult to fully understand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some of the clearest applications of AI in biology are in cancer biology, especially for diagnosing cancer [6].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AI has outperformed expert pathologists and dermatologists in diagnosing metastatic breast cancer, melanoma, and several eye diseases. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AI also contributes to innovations in liquid biopsies and pharmacogenomics, which will revolutionize cancer screening and monitoring, and improve the prediction of adverse events and patient outcomes\u201d [7]. By providing a data set of genomic or transcriptomic information, we can develop an AI program that is designed to identify key variations within the data. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The problem lies, primarily, in providing the initial data set.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the 21</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">st</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> century, an era of data hacks and privacy breaches, the general public is not keen to release their private information, especially when this information contains everything about their medical history. Because of this, \u201cResearch has suffered for lack of data scale, scope, and depth, including insufficient ethnic and gender diversity, datasets that lack environment and lifestyle data, and snapshots-in-time versus longitudinal data. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Artificial intelligence is starved for data that reflects population diversity and real-world information\u201d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [8]. The ultimate goal of using AI is to identify markers and genetic patterns that can be used to treat or diagnose a genetic disease. However, until we have data that accurately represents the patient, this cannot be achieved. A study in 2016 showed that 80% of participants of Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) were of European descent [9]. At first glance, the impacts of this may not be so clear. But when a disease such as sickle cell anemia is considered, the disparity becomes more relevant. Sickle cell anemia is a condition where red blood cells are not disk-shaped, as they are in most individuals, but rather in the shape of a sickle, which reduces their surface area, which in turn reduces their ability to carry oxygen around the body. This is a condition that disproportionately affects people of African descent, so it is not reasonable to expect to be able to find a genetic marker or cure for this disease when the data set does not accurately reflect this population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another key issue is privacy laws. While it is important to note that any genomic data released to a federal agency such as the NIH for research purposes will be de-identified, meaning that the patient will be made anonymous, studies have shown that people can be re-identified using their genomic data, the remaining identifiers still attached to their genome, and the availability of genealogical data and public records [10]. Additionally, once your data is obtained, policies like the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act do protect you in some ways, but these pieces of legislation are not all-encompassing, and still leave the window open for some forms of genetic discrimination, such as school admissions. The agencies conducting research have the infrastructure to store and protect patient data, but in the era of data leaks and security breaches, there are some serious concerns that need to be addressed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ultimately, AI in genomics could transform the world within a matter of days, allowing\u00a0 Modern biology, defined by the innovation of NGS technologies, has redefined what is possible. Every day, scientists all around the world generate data sets larger than ever before, making a system to understand them all the more necessary. AI could be the solution, but before any scientific revolution happens, it is vital that the legislation protecting citizens and their private medical information be updated to reflect the technology of the times. Our next challenge as a society in the 21st century is not developing the cure for cancer or discovering new secrets about the history of human evolution, but rather it is developing a system that will support and ensure the protection of all people involved in this groundbreaking journey for the decades to come.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0122-6</li>\n<li>https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/</li>\n<li>https://en.chessbase.com/post/kasparov-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence</li>\n<li>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.278.5274&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=41</li>\n<li>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0191-0</li>\n<li>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6373233/</li>\n<li>https://www.genengnews.com/insights/looking-ahead-to-2030/</li>\n<li>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5089703/</li>\n<li>https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Privacy</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

Two twins, named with the pseudonyms Lulu and Nana, were born from these very controversial experiments. This news rapidly propelled the debate on human germline genome editing into the mainstream. My interest in this issue was inspired by my involvement with the Innovative Genomics Institute, located in Berkeley, CA. While attending Berkeley City College during the spring and fall semesters of 2019, I participated in the institute\u2019s CRISPR journal club for undergraduates. Each week, we discussed the latest research from the field of CRISPR gene editing. I also took part in a conference, attended by leading geneticists, bioethicists, philosophers, professors of law and policy, science journalists, and other stakeholders, examining where the consensus, if any, lies on human germline genome editing. Discussions from this conference serve as a foundation for this submission to The Aggie Transcript.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New details have emerged in the ongoing controversy that kicked off in November of 2018 when a Chinese biophysicist claimed that, during in vitro fertilization, he had genetically edited two embryos that were later implanted into their mother. Twins, anonymously named Lulu and Nana, are believed to have been born as a result of these experiments. This announcement from He Jiankui in a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jILo9y71s0&amp;list=PL_zFWAj6OHZi4sTJ0LbMwv83xfOgDCivb&amp;index=3&amp;t=1843s\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">presentation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> at the Second International Summit on Human Germline Editing in Hong Kong was largely met with swift condemnation from scientists and bioethicists [1, 2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Late last year, </span><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/03/131752/chinas-crispr-babies-read-exclusive-excerpts-he-jiankui-paper\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">excerpts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> of the unpublished research report were made public for the first time since He\u2019s announcement, shedding light on his approach to edit resistance to human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, into human genomes using CRISPR-Cas9 [3]. CRISPR, short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, are specific patterns in bacterial DNA. Normally, a bacterium that has survived an attack by a bacteriophage</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">a virus that infects bacteria and depends on them in order to reproduce</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014will </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">catalog bacteriophage DNA by incorporating these viral sequences into their own DNA library. This genetic archive of viral DNA, stored between the palindromic repeats of CRISPR, can be revisited as a reference when the bacterium faces future attacks, aiding in its immune response [4].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To respond effectively, bacteria will transcribe a complementary CRISPR RNA molecule from the existing CRISPR sequence. Using crRNA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">short for CRISPR RNA</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">as a guide, CRISPR-associated proteins play the part of a search engine, scanning the cell for any entering viral DNA that matches the crRNA sequence [5]. There are many subtypes of CRISPR-associated proteins [6], but Cas9 is one such type that acts as an enzyme by catalyzing double-stranded breaks in sequences complementary to the guide [7]. This immune system effectively defends against the DNA of invading bacteriophages, protecting the bacterium from succumbing to the virus [5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A cell\u2019s built-in mechanisms typically repair any double-stranded breaks in DNA via one of two processes: nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) [8]. During NHEJ, base pairs might be unintentionally inserted or deleted, causing frameshift mutations called indels in the repaired DNA sequence. These mutations significantly affect the structure and function of any protein encoded by the sequence and can result in a completely nonfunctional gene product. NHEJ is frequently relied upon by gene editing researchers to \u201cknock out\u201d or inactivate certain genes. HDR is less efficient, but the process is often exploited by scientists to \u201cknock in\u201d genes or substitute DNA [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CRISPR is programmable, meaning that certain DNA sequences can be easily added to these sites, precisely altering the cell\u2019s genetic code at specific locations. Jiankui He was not the first to use CRISPR to edit the genes of human embryos, but no one was known to have ever performed these experiments on viable embryos intended for a pregnancy.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He and two of his colleagues have since been fined and sentenced to prison for falsifying ethical review documents and misinforming doctors, the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua reported in December 2019 [10]. But He\u2019s experiments supposedly yielded another birth during the second half of 2019 [11], confirmed by China in January [12], and Russian scientist Denis Rebrikov has since expressed strong interest in moving forward with human germline genome editing to explore a potential cure for deafness [13].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite what seems like overwhelming opposition to human germline genome editing, He\u2019s work has even generated interest from self-described biohackers like Josiah Zayner, CEO of The ODIN, a company which produces do-it-yourself genetic engineering kits for use at home and in the classroom.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAs long as the children He Jiankui engineered haven\u2019t been harmed by the experiment, he is just a scientist who forged some documents to convince medical doctors to implant gene-edited embryos,\u201d said Zayner in a </span><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/02/crispr-babies-scientist-he-jiankui-should-not-be-villainized/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">STAT opinion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> reacting to news of He\u2019s sentence [14]. \u201cThe 4-minute mile of human genetic engineering has been broken. It will happen again.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Concerns abound, though, about the use of this technology to cure human diseases. And against the chilling backdrop of a global COVID-19 pandemic, fears run especially high about bad actors using CRISPR gene editing with malicious intent.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A scientist or biohacker with basic lab know-how could conceivably buy DNA sequences and, using CRISPR, edit them to make an even more panic-inducing bacteria or virus,\u201d said Neal Bear, a television producer and global health lecturer at Harvard Medical School, in a recent </span><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/26/could-rogue-scientist-use-crispr-create-pandemic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">STAT opinion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [15]. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop a rogue scientist from using CRISPR to conjure up an even deadlier version of Ebola or a more transmissible SARS?\u201d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Into the unknown understanding off-target effects</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In his initial presentation, He said that he had targeted the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) gene, which codes for a receptor on white blood cells recognized by HIV during infection. His presentation suggested that gene editing introduced a known mutation named </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5\u039432</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that changes the receptor enough to at least partially inhibit recognition by HIV. The babies\u2019 father was a carrier of HIV, so this editing was performed to supposedly protect the twins from future HIV infection [16].</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He\u2019s edits to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> gene</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">human germline genome editing, in general</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">worry geneticists because the off-target effects of introducing artificial changes into the human gene pool are largely unknown. In a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th0vnOmFltc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> posted on his lab\u2019s YouTube channel [17], He claimed that follow-up sequencing of the twins\u2019 genomes confirmed that \u201cno gene was changed except the one to prevent HIV infection.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Excerpts from the unpublished study indicate otherwise, according to an expert asked to </span><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/03/131752/chinas-crispr-babies-read-exclusive-excerpts-he-jiankui-paper/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">comment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on He\u2019s research in MIT Technology Review, because any cells taken from the twins to run these sequencing tests were no longer part of the developing embryos [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt is technically impossible to determine whether an edited embryo \u2018did not show any off-target mutations\u2019 without destroying that embryo by inspecting every one of its cells,\u201d said Fyodor Urnov, professor of molecular and cell biology at UC Berkeley and gene-editing specialist [3]. \u201cThis is a key problem for the entirety of the embryo-editing field, one that the authors sweep under the rug here.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Urnov\u2019s comments raise concerns about \u201cmosaicism\u201d in the cells of Lulu and Nana</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014and any other future babies brought to term after germline genome editing during embryonic stages of development. In his experiments, He used preimplantation genetic diagnosis to verify gene editing. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even if the cells tested through this technique showed the intended mutation, though, there is a significant risk that the remaining cells in the embryo were left unedited or that unknown mutations with unforeseeable consequences were introduced [16].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5\u039432 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">mutation has, indeed, been found to be associated with HIV resistance [18, 19], even individuals with both copies of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5\u039432 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">can still be infected with certain strains of HIV [20]. In addition, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5\u039432</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> mutation is found almost exclusively in certain European populations and in very low frequencies elsewhere, including China [21, 22], amplifying the uncertain risk of introducing this particular mutation into Chinese individuals and the broader Chinese gene pool [16].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps most shocking to the scientific community is the revelation that He\u2019s experiment did not actually edit the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">gene as intended. In He\u2019s November 2018 presentation, he discussed the rates of mutation via non-homologous end-joining but made no mention of the other repair mechanism, homology-directed repair, which would be used to \u201cknock in\u201d the intended mutation. This \u201c[suggests] that He had no intention of generating the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5\u039432</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> allele,\u201d wrote Haoyi Wang and Hui Yang in a PLoS Biology </span><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000224\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">paper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on He\u2019s experiments [16].</span></p>\n<p><h4>Gauging the necessity of germline genome editing</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The potential of CRISPR to revolutionize how we treat diseases like cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and muscular dystrophy is frequently discussed in the </span><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/18/817811768/yep-they-injected-crispr-into-an-eyeball?fbclid=IwAR1RqxztsbSp5AwZM1pcqyot_3fzpNkylSFPJoD5I_HzxRXC49U-WTLgsso\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">news</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; just recently, clinical trials involving a gene-editing treatment for Leber congenital amaurosis, a rare genetic eye disorder, stirred enthusiasm, becoming the first treatment to directly edit DNA while it\u2019s still in the body [23]. While this treatment edits somatic cells</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014cells that are not passed onto future generations during reproduction\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">there is increasing demand for the use of germline genome editing as well, even despite the reservations of scientists and bioethicists.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This begs the question: how will society decide what types of genetic modifications are needed? In the case of He\u2019s experiments, most agree that germline genome editing was an unnecessary strategy to protect against HIV. Assisted reproductive technology (ART), a technique that features washing the father\u2019s sperm of excess seminal fluids before in vitro fertilization (IVF), was used in He\u2019s experiments [3] and has already been established as an effective defense against HIV transmission [24]. Appropriately handling gametes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">another word for sperm and egg cells</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">during IVF is an additional method used to protect the embryo from viral transmission, according to Jeanne O\u2019Brien, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Shady Grove Fertility Center [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cAs for considering future immunity to HIV infection, simply avoiding potential risk of HIV exposure suffices for most people,\u201d wrote Wang and Yang in their PLoS Biology paper [16]. \u201cTherefore, editing early embryos does not provide benefits for the babies, while posing potentially serious risks on multiple fronts.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One such unintended risk of He\u2019s experiments might be increased susceptibility to West Nile virus, an infection thought to be prevented by unmutated copies of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CCR5</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> receptor [11].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a </span><a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/crispr.2019.0042\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">paper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that examines the societal and ethical impacts of human germline genome editing, published last year in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The CRISPR Journal </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[25], authors Jodi Halpern, Sharon O\u2019Hara, Kevin Doxzen, Lea Witkowsky, and Aleksa Owen add that \u201cthis mutation may increase vulnerability to other infections such as influenza, creating an undue burden on these offspring, [so] we would opt instead for safer ways to prevent HIV infection.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The authors go on to propose the implementation of a Human Rights Impact Assessment. This assessment would evaluate germline editing treatments or policies using questions that weigh the benefits of an intervention against its possible risks or its potential to generate discrimination. The ultimate goal of such an assessment would be to \u201cestablish robust regulatory frameworks necessary for the global protection of human rights\u201d [25].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most acknowledge that there are several questions to answer before human germline genome editing should proceed: Should we do it? Which applications of the technology are ethical? How can we govern human germline genome editing? Who has the privilege of making these decisions?</span></p>\n<p><h4>Evaluating consensus on germline genome editing</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In late October of last year, scientists, bioethicists, policymakers, patient advocates, and religious leaders gathered with members of the public in Berkeley for a discussion centered around some of these unanswered questions. One of the pioneers of CRISPR gene editing technologies, Jennifer Doudna, is a professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at UC Berkeley, and the Innovative Genomics Institute, which houses Doudna\u2019s lab, organized this </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CRISPR Consensus? </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">conference in collaboration with the Initiative on Science, Technology, and Human Identity at Arizona State University and the Keystone Policy Center.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The goal of the conference was to generate conversation about where the consensus, if any, lies on human germline genome editing. One of the conference organizers, J. Benjamin Hurlbut, emphasized the role that bioethics</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014the study of ethical, social, and legal issues caused by biomedical technologies\u2014should play </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in considerations of germline genome editing.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He\u2019s \u201caim was apparently to race ahead of his scientific competitors but also to reshape and speed up, as he put it, the ethical debate. But speed is surely not what we need in this case,\u201d said Hurlbut, associate professor of biology and society at Arizona State University, at the conference [26].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Central to the debate surrounding consensus is the issue of stakeholders in decision-making about germline genome editing. Experts seem to be divided in their definitions of a stakeholder, with varying opinions about the communities that should be included in governance. They do agree, however, that these discussions are paramount to ensure beneficence and justice, tenets of bioethical thought, for those involved.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An underlying reason for these concerns is that, should human germline genome editing become widely available in the future, the cost of these therapies might restrict access to certain privileged populations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s far-fetched to say that there\u2019s institutionalized racism that goes on around access to this technology, the democratization and self-governance of it,\u201d said Keolu Fox, a UC San Diego scholar who studies the anthropology of natural selection from a genomics perspective. Fox focused his discussion on indigenous populations when addressing the issue of autonomy in governance of germline genome editing [26].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIf we don\u2019t put indigenous people or vulnerable populations in the driver\u2019s seat so that they can really think about the potential applications of this type of technology, self-governance, and how to create intellectual property that has a circular economy that goes back to their community,\u201d Fox said, \u201cthat is continued colonialism in 2020.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indeed, marginalized communities have experienced the evil that genetics can be used to justify, and millions of lives have been lost throughout human history to ideologies emphasizing genetic purity like eugenics and Nazism.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe know that history with genetics is wrought with a lot of wrongdoings and also good intentions that can go wrong, and so there\u2019s a community distrust [of germline editing],\u201d said Billie Liangolou, a UC San Francisco (UCSF) Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital genetic counselor, during a panel on stakeholders that included Fox. Liangolou works with expecting mothers, guiding them through the challenges associated with difficult genetic diagnoses during pregnancy [26].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Others agree that the communities affected most by human germline genome editing should be at the forefront of decision-making about this emerging technology. Sharon Begley, a senior science writer at STAT News, told the conference audience that a mother with a genetic disease once asked her if she could \u201cjust change my little drop of the human gene pool so that my children don\u2019t have this terrible thing that I have\u201d [26].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This question, frequently echoed throughout society by other prospective parents, reflects the present-day interest in human germline genome editing technologies, interest that will likely continue to grow as further research on human embryos continues.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In an </span><a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/21/should-broken-genes-be-fixed-my-daughter-changed-the-way-i-think-about-that-question/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">opinion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> published by STAT News, Ethan Weiss, a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at UCSF, acknowledges the concerns of parents faced with these decisions [27]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. His daughter, Ruthie, has oculocutaneous albinism, a rare genetic disorder characterized by mutations in the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">OCA2 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">gene, which is involved in producing melanin. Necessary for normally functioning vision, melanin is a pigment found in the eyes [28].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Weiss and his partner \u201cbelieve that had we learned our unborn child had oculocutaneous albinism, Ruthie would not be here today. She would have been filtered out as an embryo or terminated,\u201d he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But, in the end, Weiss offers up a cautionary message to readers, encouraging people to \u201cthink hard\u201d about the potential effects of human germline genome editing.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cWe know that Ruthie\u2019s presence in this world makes it a better, kinder, more considerate, more patient, and more humane place,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt is not hard, then, to see that these new technologies bring risk that the world will be less kind, less compassionate, and less patient when there are fewer children like Ruthie. And the kids who inevitably end up with oculocutaneous albinism or other rare diseases will be even less \u2018normal\u2019 than they are today.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Weiss\u2019 warning is underscored by disability rights scholars who say that treating genetic disorders with CRISPR or other germline editing technologies could lead to heightened focus on those who continue to live with these disabilities. In an </span><a href=\"https://www.geneticsandsociety.org/biopolitical-times/illness-or-identity-disability-rights-scholar-comments-plan-use-crispr-prevent\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">interview</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with Katie Hasson of the Center for Genetics and Society, located in Berkeley, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jackie Leach Scully commented on the stigmatization that disabled people might face in a world where germline editing is regularly practiced [29].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cSince only a minority of disability is genetic, even if genome editing eventually becomes a safe and routine technology it won\u2019t eradicate disability,\u201d said Scully, professor of bioethics at the University of New South Wales in Australia. \u201cThe concern then would be about the social effects of [heritable genome editing] for people with non-genetic disabilities, and the context that such changes would create for them.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Others worry about how to define the boundary between the prevention of genetic diseases and the enhancement of desirable traits</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014and what this means for the decisions a germline editing governing body would have to make about people\u2019s value in society. Emily Beitiks, associate director </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">of the Paul K. Longmore Institute on Disability at San Francisco State University, is among the community of experts who have raised such concerns [30].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0\u201cKnowing that these choices are being made in a deeply ableist culture,\u201d said Beitiks in an </span><a href=\"https://longmoreinstitute.sfsu.edu/5-reasons-why-we-need-people-disabilities-crispr-debates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> posted on the Center for Genetics and Society\u2019s blog [30], \u201cillustrates how hard it would be to draw lines about what genetic diseases \u2018we\u2019 agree to engineer out of the gene pool and which are allowed to stay.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Religious leaders have also weighed in on the ethics of human germline genome editing. Father Joseph Tham, who has previously published work on what he calls \u201cthe secularization of bioethics,\u201d presented his views on the role of religion in this debate about bioethics at the conference [26].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cMany people in the world belong to some kind of religious tradition, and I think it would be a shame if religion is not a part of this conversation,\u201d said Tham, professor at Regina Apostolorum Pontifical University\u2019s School of Bioethics.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tham explained that the church already disapproves of IVF techniques, let alone human germline editing, \u201cbecause in some way it deforms the whole sense of the human sexual act.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Islamic perspectives on germline editing differ. In a </span><a href=\"https://issues.org/islamic-ethical-perspectives-on-human-genome-editing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">paper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> published last year, Mohammed Ghaly, one of the conference panelists, discussed how the Islamic religious tradition informs perspectives on human genome editing in the Muslim world [31].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cThe mainstream position among Muslim scholars is that before embryos are implanted in the uterus, they do not have the moral status of a human being,\u201d said Ghaly, professor of Islam and biomedical ethics at Hamad Bin Khalifa University. \u201cThat is why the scholars find it unproblematic to use them for conducting research with the aim of producing beneficial knowledge.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where Muslim religious scholars draw the line, Ghaly says, is at the applications of human germline genome editing, not research about it. Issues regarding the safety and effectiveness of germline editing make its current use in viable human embryos largely untenable, according to the majority of religious scholars [31].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The unfolding, back-and-forth debate about who and how to design policies guiding human germline genome editing continues to rage on, but there is little doubt about consensus on one point. For a technology with effects as far-reaching as this one, time is of the essence.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scientist who claims to have made gene-edited babies speaks in Hong Kong </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. 27 Nov 2018, 36:04 minutes.

Although medications save millions of lives every year, any one of these might not work for one person even if it works for someone else. With this paper, I hope to shed light on this new rising field and the lasting effects it can have on the human population.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Future of Modern Medicine</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Take the following scenario: You\u2019re experiencing a persistent cough, a loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss to only then find an egg-like swelling under your arm. Today, a doctor would determine your diagnosis by taking a biopsy of your arm and analyzing the cells using the microscope, a 400-year-old technology. You have non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Today\u2019s treatment plan for this condition is a generic one-size-fits-all chemotherapy with some combination of alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, and corticosteroids (just to name a few) that would be injected intravenously to target fast-dividing cells that can harm both cancer cells and healthy cells [1]. This approach may be effective, but if it doesn\u2019t work, your doctor tells you not to despair \u2013 there are some other possible drug combinations that might be able to save you.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Flash forward to the future. Your doctor will now instead scan your arm with a DNA array, a computer chip-like device that can register the activity patterns of thousands of different genes in your cells. It will then tell you that your case of lymphoma is actually one of six distinguishable types of T-cell cancer, each of which is known to respond best to different drugs. Your doctor will then use a SNP chip to flag medicines that won\u2019t work in your case since your liver enzymes break them down too fast.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Tailoring Treatment to the Individual</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The latter case is one that we all wish to encounter if we were in this scenario. Luckily, this may be the case one day with the implementation of pharmacogenomics in personalized medicine. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This new field takes advantage of the fact that new medications typically require extensive trials and testing to ensure its safety, thus holding the potential as a new solution to bypass the traditional testing process of pharmaceuticals.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though only the average response is reported, if the drug is shown to have adverse side effects to any fraction of the population, the drug is immediately rejected. \u201cMany drugs fail in clinical trials because they turn out to be toxic to just 1% or 2% of the population,\u201d says Mark Levin, CEO of Millennium Pharmaceuticals [2]. With genotyping, drug companies will be able to identify specific gene variants underlying severe side effects, allowing the occasional toxic reports to be accepted, as gene tests will determine who should and shouldn\u2019t get them. Such pharmacogenomic advances will more than double the FDA approval rate of drugs that can reach the clinic. In the past, fast-tracking was only reserved for medications that were to treat untreatable illnesses. However, pharmacogenomics allows for medications to undergo an expedited process, regardless of the severity of the disease. There would be fewer guidelines to follow because the entire population would not need to produce a desirable outcome. As long as the cause of the adverse reaction can be attributed to a specific genetic variant, the drug will be approved by the FDA [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Certain treatments already exist using this current model, such as for those who are afflicted with a certain genetic variant of cystic fibrosis. Additionally, this will contribute to reducing the number of yearly cases of adverse drug reactions. As with any field, pharmacogenomics is still a rising field and is not without its challenges, but new research is still being conducted to test its viability.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With pharmacogenomic informed personalized medicine, individualized treatment can be designed according to one\u2019s genomic profile to predict the clinical outcome of different treatments in different patients</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [4]. Normally, drugs would be tested on a large population, where the average response would be reported. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While this method of medicine relies on the law of averages, personalized medicine, on the other hand, recognizes that no two patients are alike </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Genetic Variants</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By doubling the approval rate, there will be a larger variety of drugs available to patients with unique circumstances where the generic treatment fails. In pharmacogenomics, genomic information is used to study individual responses to drugs. Experiments can be designed to determine the correlation between particular gene variants with exact drug responses. Specifically, modern approaches, including multigene analysis or whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiles, will assist in clinical trials for drug discovery and development [5]. SNPs are especially useful as they are genetically unique to each individual and are responsible for many variable characteristics, such as appearance and personality. A strong grasp of SNPs is fundamental to understand why an individual may have a specific reaction to a drug. Furthermore, SNPs can also be applied so that these genetic markers can be mapped to certain drug responses.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Research regarding specific genetic variants and their association with a varying drug response will be fundamental in prescribing a drug to a patient. The design and implementation of personalized medical therapy will not only improve the outcome of treatments but also reduce the risk of toxicity and other adverse effects. A better understanding of individual variations and their effect on drug response, metabolism excretion, and toxicity has the potential to replace the trial-and-error approach of treatment. Evidence of the clinical utility of pharmacogenetic testing is only available for a few medications, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels only require pharmacogenetics testing for a small number of drugs [6].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Cystic Fibrosis Case Study</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While this concept may seem far-fetched, a few select treatments have been approved by the FDA for certain populations, as this field of study promotes the development of targeted therapies. For example, the drug Ivacaftor was approved for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe. Those diagnosed with CF have a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, rendering the resulting CFTR protein defective. This protein is responsible for moving chloride to the cell surface, attracting water that will then generate mucus. However, those with the mutation have thick and sticky mucus, leaving the patient susceptible to germs and other infections as the bacteria that would normally be cleared [7]. Ivacaftor is only approved for CF patients who bear the specific G551D genetic variant, a specific mutation in the CFTR gene. This drug can then target the CFTR protein, increase its activity, and consequently improve lung function [8]. It\u2019s important to note that the G551D is only just one genetic variant out of 1,700 currently known mutations that can cause CF.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Adverse Drug Reactions</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pharmacogenomics also addresses the unknown adverse effects of drugs, especially for medications that are taken too often or too long. These adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are estimated to cost $136 billion annually. Additionally, within the United States itself, serious side effects from pharmaceutical drugs occur in 2 million people each year and may cause as many as 100,000 deaths, making it the fourth most common cause of death according to the FDA [9].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The mysterious and unpredictable side effects of various drugs have been chalked up to individual variation encoded in the genome and not drug dosage. Genetics also determines hypersensitivity reactions in patients who may be allergic to certain drugs. In these cases, the body will initiate a rapid and aggressive immune response that can hinder breathing and may even lead to a cardiovascular collapse [5]. This is just one of the countless cases where unknown patient hypersensitivity to drugs can lead to extreme outcomes. However, some new research in pharmacogenomics has shown that 80% of the variability in drugs can be reduced. The implications of this new research could mean that a significant amount of these ADRs could be significantly decreased inpatient management, leading to better outcomes [11].\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Challenges</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pharmacogenomic informed medicine may suggest the ultimate demise of the traditional model of drug development, but the concept of targeted therapy is still in its early stages. One reason that this may be the case is due to the fact that most pharmacogenetic traits involve more than one gene, making it even more difficult to understand or even predict the different variations of a complex phenotype like a drug response. Through genome-wide approaches, there is evidence of drugs having multiple targets and numerous off-target results [4].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even though this is a promising field, there are challenges that must be overcome. There is a large gap between integrating the primary care workforce with genomic information for various diseases and conditions as many healthcare workers are not prepared to integrate genomics into their daily practice. Medical school curriculums would need to be updated in order to implement information and knowledge regarding pharmacogenomics incorporated personalized medicine. This would also create a barrier in presenting this new research to broader audiences including medical personnel due to the complexity of the field and its inherently interdisciplinary nature [12].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The field has made important strides over the past decade, but clinical trials are still needed to not only identify the various links between genes and treatment outcome, but also to clarify the meaning of these associations and translate them into prescribing guidelines [4]. Despite its potential, there are not many examples where pharmacogenomics impacts clinical utility, especially since many genetic variants have not been studied yet. Nonetheless, progress in the field gives us a glimpse of a time where pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine will be a part of regular patient care.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Sources</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cChemotherapy for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.\u201d American Cancer Society, </span><a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/cancer/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/treating/chemotherapy.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.cancer.org/cancer/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/treating/chemotherapy.html</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Greek, Jean Swingle., and C.
