Actually, we have known a population of baleen whales has existed in the GOMx since at least 1965 [3], and historical records suggest that local whalers attempted to hunt them since at least the late 1700s [4]. However, scientists initially believed that they were members of another wide-ranging tropical species called the Bryde\u2019s whale, which frequents the neighboring Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. This is easily forgivable, as the outward appearance of these GOMx whales are virtually indistinguishable. Both have essentially the same streamlined, sleek bodies of uniform dark charcoal gray or brown coloration on top, and a mix of pale and pink underneath. A large, hook-shaped dorsal fin is placed around two-thirds down from the tip of the snout. The snouts themselves are spear-shaped with three distinct prominent ridges on top (a thick central one extending from snout end to blowhole, and two slightly smaller ones flanking both sides) (Figure 1) [1]. It was not until the 1990s [3] when scientists realized that the GOMx whales inhabits an extremely narrow and isolated area. Nearly all reside within the scientist-dubbed \u201ccore habitat\u201d\u2014a thin deep-water stretch off the western coastlines of Florida with seafloors between 150-410 meters deep\u2014while a few exist in even narrower secondary habitats of similar seafloor depths extending to Texas (Figure 2) [1]. This hinted that they may be set apart from the Atlantic Bryde\u2019s whales.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4796 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"207\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-300x207.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-200x138.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-300x207.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-400x276.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-600x413.png 600w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-768x529.png 768w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-800x551.png 800w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-1024x706.png 1024w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM-1200x827.png 1200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.26.39-PM.png 1518w\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 2. Map of the Rice\u2019s Whale habitat within the GOMx</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The possibility that populations thought to be an existing known species are actually new species is nothing new with cetaceans. Mobile marine mammals that seek refuge below the surface can be difficult to study, and granting any divergent population its own scientific name requires (1) substantial morphological and genetic evidence from bone and tissue samples to prove it\u2019s not simply a variant of an existing species, and (2) a skull to serve as a defining specimen, or holotype. In other words, we need good DNA and dead whales. As a result, many potential species are left undescribed as scientists wait for a beached individual to obtain a cetacean cadaver without needing to harm the same whales they seek to study and save [1].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This was the case for the GOMx whales when Rosel &amp; Wilcox (2014), two NMFS geneticists, compared the genetic sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR) collected from beachings and biopsies with other Bryde\u2019s whales. The mtDNA CR is often used by geneticists to study recent evolutionary histories due to its exceptionally fast mutation rate, capturing even the most subtle of population diversity [5][6]. The geneticists found that the GOMx whales were actually most closely related to a similar Asian species called the Eden\u2019s whale\u2013also previously thought to be a Bryde\u2019s whale\u2013with a ~10% net nucleotide divergence. This was far above the 2% divergence threshold for a distinct species, establishing that a new species likely exists [7]. A multi-year hunt for a holotype followed. First, the NMFS visited museums that held skeletons of GOMx Bryde\u2019s whales, but none had a complete skull. Then, they attempted to recover the skeleton of a whale that washed up in Tampa Bay, Florida after colliding with a ship in 2009 and was subsequently buried in a nearby park [1] as standard disposal practice to prevent spreading infectious diseases or attracting scavengers [8]. Unfortunately, upon excavation in 2018, they found that seeping tides had damaged much of the specimen over its years of burial. Finally, a stroke of luck occurred when in 2019 another individual washed up in Everglades National Park, which had bled to death due to a laceration in its stomach caused by a tiny piece of plastic it swallowed. The NMFS and National Park Service quickly genetically sampled and buried the whale in a more secure location, exhumed the skeleton, and safely transported it to the Smithsonian\u2019s Whale Collections. There, Rosel et al. (2021) had the holotype and morphological evidence, in the form of a unique cranial and nasal structure, needed to formally describe a new species, giving it the scientific name </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Balaenoptera ricei</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [1].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Second most endangered in the world</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though identical in external appearance, the Rice\u2019s and Bryde\u2019s whales are otherwise very different. A molecular clock shows that they diverged at least 4-8 million years ago [1, 9], and the few hints we have so far suggest a unique biology for the former. But as further study of the new species unfolds, understanding how exactly it stands apart continues to develop [1, 2, 10, 11]. We know that it\u2019s the only baleen whale native to the GOMx. While the basin receives occasional fin, blue, sei, minke, and right whale visitors, they never stay for long and have no influence on the local ecology [1, 12]. Rice\u2019s whales are also entirely resident, meaning the species stays in the same area year-round and doesn\u2019t migrate. This is the only instance we know of that an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">entire species </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">of mysticete is tied to a tiny piece of the ocean. While other baleen whales hold populations and subspecies that have settled into areas of reliable year-round productivity, such as the Arabian Sea humpback whales [13] and Gulf of California fin whales [14], their species still include wide-wandering members that will endure when one population tragically dies out. To lose the Rice\u2019s whales is to lose a special diversity, endemism, and ecological role of an entire classification of animals in the GOMx.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This newest species of marine mammal is, ironically, also one of the closest to extinction. The most recent population study from a 2017-2018 survey within US waters numbers 51 individuals left in existence [2], with only 26 of them being mature individuals capable of reproduction [15]. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This makes it the</span></i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">second most endangered marine mammal species and arguably the fourth most endangered </span></i><h4>mammal species</h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in the world</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Only the Sumatran rhinoceros, with a slightly lower population of 34-47 individuals [16], Hanian gibbon, with at least 35 individuals [17], and vaquita, with merely 10 individuals remaining [18], inch closer to extinction. As is often the consequence of such a low population, the Rice\u2019s whale also suffers from extremely low genetic diversity. Only two haplotypes, inherited chromosomal DNA variants, were identified from a sample of 36 individuals. Tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium yielded a mean observed heterozygosity frequency of 0.256, meaning that on average, over 74% of the samples\u2019 gene pool were homozygous genotypes that carried only one allele each. Previous studies have shown that healthy Bryde\u2019s whale populations can display an average of 3.6 to 9.3 alleles per loci, or different genes within fixed positions on chromosomes. But examination of 42 loci within the Rice\u2019s whale population showed an average of 2.5 alleles per locus. This lack of diversity underlines the genetic threat Rice\u2019s whales face in restoring populations [5]. With less available alleles, a population has less variety of traits that support adaptability. In addition, increased homozygosity decreases the ability to suppress recessive genes that are deleterious, or cause genetic diseases. Such a low genetic diversity further puts the Rice\u2019s whale at risk of inbreeding depression, which can cause the accumulation of deleterious genes that will further weaken the population [1, 5, 12]. At worst, pessimistic ecologists expect the species to be the first great whale to go extinct in over 300 years and largest victim of the Anthropocene extinction to date [19, 20].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Things look grim for the Rice\u2019s whale, but there is hope: rebounding from the spiral toward extinction is possible. For this, ecologists recommend the 50/500 rule, which postulates that a minimum of 50 viable individuals are required to escape inbreeding depression and 500 individuals to reduce harmful genetic drift [12]. It has been projected that a population of 35 Rice\u2019s whales could achieve the 500 threshold within 68 years if conservation efforts can successfully sustain a recovery trend [12, 21].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Demystifying Gulf of Mexico\u2019s only native mysticete</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Setting the stage for this recovery requires better understanding of the ecological dynamics of the Rice\u2019s whale and how it intersects with potential environmental threats. Although the existence of its population was acknowledged for decades, they remained unstudied [4] until the mid 2010s, meaning research of the whale is novel. To unravel the secrets mystifying a new mysticete, scientists face the challenge of finding a starting point to begin at. For the Rice\u2019s whale, this was identification. Because Bryde\u2019s whales were never known in the GOMx, one could infer that any similar baleen whale spotted in the area is likely a Rice\u2019s whale. But since the two can\u2019t be visually distinguished, this geographic inference isn\u2019t an objectively rigorous method. Genetically testing biopsy samples, while conclusive, isn\u2019t feasible for every encounter. Instead, scientists are adopting acoustic measurements as a method of differentiation that is both efficient and readily available [2, 22, 23]. By sticking microphones underwater during ship expeditions, in a procedure called passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), scientists can collect a soundscape of the surrounding ocean environment. While the soundscape will contain ambient noises of both random water sounds and the ship\u2019s own propeller, it may also pick up vocalizations of marine animals that are stereotyped, or unique to them. By identifying these stereotypes from ambient noise, scientists can identify the animal producing them. The possibility of identifying Rice\u2019s whales through their vocalizations was recognized in literature as early as 2014 [22, 23], but it took years of PAMs, survey expeditions, and painstaking data analysis to connect beyond reasonable doubt each potential whale vocalization to the species. It was eventually concluded by 2022 that Rice\u2019s whales have a vocal repertoire of at least three stereotyped call types, the most common and diagnostic being dubbed the long-moans. Sounding like a faraway airplane\u2019s takeoff but slowed-down and muffled, this call was especially easy to identify for its unusually long duration of about 22 seconds on average [2].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scientists then studied the whale\u2019s feeding behavior. In 2015 and 2018, scientists tagged two Rice\u2019s whales. The suction-cup tags, which contained kinematic recorders, collectively provided nearly 90 hours of data of the individuals\u2019 exact positions and orientations in a 3D space. This revealed their quarter-week routines. With a big gulp of air, the whales descended to the twilight zone and foraged near the seafloor for up to 10 minutes at a time. There, the whales swam large circles around their prey before capturing them with a powerful lunge or two. They spent the entire day cycling between entering deep water to feed (up to 271 meters below the surface) and surfacing to breathe. At nightfall, the whales ascended and hung around the surface, spending 85% of the night within 15 meters of the surface, and descended again at daybreak. [2, 11, 24] This pattern of oscillating between deep and shallow water through day and night is a typical example of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">diel vertical diving</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [10]. If the two samples are representative for the Rice\u2019s whale, it\u2019s an unusual strategy, as most baleen whales like the Bryde\u2019s whale will typically feed at the surface or within the sunlight zone [25].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A 2023 study investigated the deep-water diet behind this peculiar behavior using the emerging techniques of stable isotope models. Each animal carries a distinctive signature of stable isotope ratios that broadly reflect that animal\u2019s ecology, most significantly its diet. True to the phrase \u201cyou are what you eat,\u201d when a predator eats another animal, the prey\u2019s isotope signatures are integrated into the predator\u2019s tissue. How the predator\u2019s resulting signature is made up depends on what prey it ate and how much of it, creating a sort of chemical food diary. By comparing the stable isotope ratios of tissue samples of the predator and suspected prey and using a set of probabilistic models that addresses the abundance and biomass of suspected prey relative to its ecosystem, one can reconstruct and quantify the entire food web of the predator, including what it specifically targets as its favorite food. This is all without cutting open a single stomach [26, 27]. The scientists measured the stable isotope ratios of carbon (\u03b4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">13</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">C) and nitrogen (\u03b4</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">15</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">N), the most informative in revealing diet, in skin and blubber biopsy samples of Rice\u2019s whales collected during survey expeditions. They then compared with the ratios found in potential prey species caught during a July 2019 trawling survey in the core habitat, whose relative abundances and biomasses were also determined. The resulting analysis found that the Rice\u2019s whales are picky eaters. Their diet is overwhelmingly composed of a single prey\u2013a stumpy sardine-like schooling fish called the silver-rag driftfish (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ariomma bondi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">)\u2013which made up over two-thirds of Rice\u2019s whale diet. Interestingly, Rice\u2019s whales do not appear to target the extremely common Atlantic pearlside (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maurolicus weitzmani</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">), a similar schooling fish that made up over 88% of the core habitat\u2019s ecological community by abundance. By contrast, the silver-rag only comprised 1.21% of community abundance. Why bother the effort to seek out a far rarer species? It turns out that the energy content of silver-rags surpasses all other prey by a wide margin. Every pound in wet weight of silver-rag contains on average over 36% more calories than the next animal on the menu. Rice\u2019s whales seem to actively select their prey based on nutritional quality rather than abundance, singling out the silver-rag as the best bang for buck [26].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These feeding preferences also demonstrate an ecological importance of Rice\u2019s whales: as ecosystem engineers. Whales feeding at the seafloor consume nutrients essential for photosynthesis, like iron and phosphorus, and then release them at the surface in massive fecal plumes. Through their diel vertical behavior, Rice\u2019s whales are essentially pumps, cycling nutrients tucked away hundreds of meters deep up into sunlight-rich waters where they stimulate primary productivity. The amount of biomass this can produce is immense; one 2023 study suggests that a population of 2,500 minke whales, the smallest of the baleen whales, can cycle enough phosphorus to support over 70 metric tons of carbon biomass per day [28]. If Rice\u2019s whales achieved a similar population in the past, they would have been no different.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Collision course with an industrialized Gulf</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We do not yet know how the Rice\u2019s whales came to be so endangered. Although historical records suggest attempted hunting during the 1700s and 1800s, the NMFS ruled out historical whaling as a likely factor for population decline. None of these records included successful kills, and the population evidently never experienced the dramatic rebound characteristic of other whales hunted to near-extinction in the past once overhunting by humans stopped [29]. But we know what threatens the species today is industrialization. Both the core habitat and secondary western habitats of the Rice\u2019s whale are situated right within the intersection of the most commercially and industrially active waters in North America [10, 12, 29]. This is a place home to ten of the fifteen largest ports in the US and holds vast networks of shipping lanes with hundreds to thousands of giant commercial ships that carry nearly half America\u2019s sea cargo by weight per year [12]. This places Rice\u2019s whales at high risk of a literal collision course with vessel strikes that are prone to going unreported. Because of the species\u2019 diel vertical behavior, risk of collision is especially high during nighttime, when the whales reside at the surface while visibility is reduced [10]. At least two instances of vessel strikes are already documented: the 2009 Tampa Bay beaching and a survivor left with a deformed spine [30]. Using a model for unreported collisions, the NMFS estimated that up to 20 ship strikes already occurred between 2002 and 2018. They further extrapolated that strikes may kill or seriously injure up to 17 Rice\u2019s whales, over 30 percent of the current population, in the next 50 years without increased vessel restrictions [31]. Ships that don\u2019t run over whales still produce voluminous quantities of underwater noise that muffle out vocal communication between whales and cause heavy stress that adversely alter behavior [12, 29].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4795 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"175\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-300x175.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-200x117.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-300x175.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-400x234.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-600x350.png 600w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-768x448.png 768w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-800x467.png 800w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-1024x598.png 1024w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-1200x701.png 1200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM-1536x897.png 1536w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-06-at-4.25.41-PM.png 1970w\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Figure 3. Diagram illustrating Rice\u2019s whale foraging behavior and its risks by human activity</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The northern GOMx is also one of the US\u2019 most active sites for offshore oil exploitation. Since the first drillings in 1942, over 6,000 oil rigs have been installed, with 3,200 active rigs still extracting fossil fuel from the seafloor, and oil companies continuing to explore new marine reservoirs to tap [32]. Exploration involves the frequent use of powerful airguns to blast ground-penetrating sound waves with intensities of up to 260 dB, which easily rupture cetacean eardrums. These airguns fire every few seconds in many parts of the GOMx</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[12, 29]. But the greatest threat to the Rice\u2019s whales is the oil itself. With so many active oil rigs, the GOMx is a site for frequent spills of this environmentally toxic substance, which ocean currents can carry eastward into the core habitat. While the majority of spills are rather small-scale [33], a combination of wavering environmental regulations and susceptibility of oil companies to skirt those regulations set the groundwork for a catastrophe. We know this because it has already happened. In 2010, an explosion of the BP-operated rig </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Deepwater Horizon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> off the coast of Louisiana leaked over 4 million barrels of oil into water. Federal litigation ruled that this would have been preventable if regulations were followed, but BP chose to ignore them [34]. Policy scholars also cited those regulations as too lax to enforce proper accountability anyways [35, 36]. The result was the worst environmental disaster in North American history. Caught in the center were the Rice\u2019s whales. Their core habitat was near the oil rig, and as a result nearly half of this critical refuge was smothered in oil (Figure 2). The consequences on the population are staggering. A 2015 federal investigation found that the event directly killed 17 percent of the population and caused reproductive failure in 22 percent of the female population, in total single-handedly reducing the Rice\u2019s whale population by 22 percent. Take a moment to let that sink in. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One-fifth of an entire species was wiped out by a single company\u2019s negligence</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Even of the survivors, 18 percent will live on with potentially lifelong illnesses [21]. We were never able to clean up all of the oil, which still remains on the seafloor or as marine snow and other bioaccumulating derivatives that will continue to affect Rice\u2019s whale health [37].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Road to recovery  disentangling environmental policy and politics</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the odds against the Rice\u2019s whales, it\u2019s not too late to bring them back from the brink. As emphasized in a 2022 open letter signed by over a hundred marine and wildlife scientists, Rice\u2019s whales are still reproducing [38]. We can still secure a rebound through efforts to eliminate their threats. With 51 individuals balancing on a knife\u2019s edge, the fate of this unique whale lies within the hands of our immediate collective action\u2013or inaction. This is so delicate that there was even a debate over whether an alternate common name \u201cGulf of Mexico whale\u201d is more effective in inspiring action [20]. Saving an endangered species is no cakewalk, but the road to recovery for Rice\u2019s whales will be especially challenging. Its habitat lies at the intersection of powerful industries, bringing the financial interests of the energy, shipping, and resource sectors, and even the military\u2019s defense interests to the forefront of conservation decisions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rice\u2019s whales are primarily protected under two major environmental laws. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) bans any killing, capture, or harassment of a marine mammal. The latter refers to direct actions with the potential to injure or disrupt its behavior (i.e. causing stress). The NMFS bears responsibility of translating the MMPA into specific regulations [39] and has interpreted harassment as to include harmful activities within proximity of a whale. For example, one MMPA-justified policy requires oil exploration vessels to cease all airgun activities within 500 meters of a whale sighted by onboard protected species observers in GOMx waters east of Mobile, Alabama or within seafloors deeper than 200 meters [40].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The second law is the Endangered Species Act (ESA), of which the species was listed as \u201cEndangered\u201d as a then-unnamed Bryde\u2019s whale subspecies in 2019. The listing was the fruit of years of fierce efforts, beginning with a petition by the non-governmental organization (NGO) Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) within two months of Rosel &amp; Wilcox (2014)\u2019s publication. The agency subsequently assembled a research team which published their concurring investigation in 2016. The final decision to list was made after additional years of deliberation despite opposition by industry interests and following a mandatory public notice and comment session that received nearly a thousand comments and letters with over 115,000 combined signatures [29].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The ESA mandates the federal government to (1) establish a \u201ccritical habitat\u201d zone for a listed species, (2) form a recovery plan that includes a delisting criteria, and (3) execute the plan until the species is delisted [41]. These duties for Rice\u2019s whales are delegated to the NMFS, which is awaiting public comments for a proposed critical habitat uniting the core and secondary habitats until September 2023 [42] and is working on the recovery plan. As they construct the plan, the agency must navigate through environmental and political webs to finalize something that is both effective and legally sound. In 2021, the NMFS hosted a workshop involving 45 scientists, environmental specialists, NGO leaders, and industry representatives to contextualize the focuses of the recovery plan. A Word Cloud illustrated in order the four greatest challenges to Rice\u2019s whale recovery according to participants: small population, vessel strikes, energy exploitation, and insufficient regulation [43].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the critical habitat remains in progress, measures are being taken to secure the core habitat as a surrogate. In a 2020 biological opinion regarding an expansion to leasing parts of the GOMx for oil and gas, the NMFS proposed a 10-knot daytime speed limit and entry ban during nighttime or low-visibility conditions within the area for oil and gas exploration vessels. Ships traveling at 10 knots or less were significantly less likely to hit large whales than faster speeds. When collisions do occur, the worst would be minor injuries [31]. These recommendations have since been adopted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the agency managing offshore energy leases, as conditions for authorizing oil and gas activities [44]. However, Rice\u2019s whales are still at risk of lethal high-speed collisions by unaffiliated vessels, such as cargo traffic from Florida\u2019s western ports. Recognizing this, a team of six organizations led by the NRDC submitted a petition the following year to expand the NMFS\u2019 proposal as legal policy for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">all </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">vessels within the core habitat. They pointed out the successes of universal slow-zones for critically endangered North Atlantic Right whales [30], estimated to have reduced the risk of lethal strikes by up to 90 percent [45]. The proposal is not without stakeholder concerns: local fishing communities that rely on hotspots within the core habitat fear paralysis of their main sources of income [46], while the Florida Ports Council, an organization representing the state\u2019s ports, argues it jeopardizes the western ports [467. Nevertheless, the NMFS is now considering the petition and requested public comments until July 2023 [30].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another victory came in 2023 when the NMFS denied permission for the Florida-based Eglin Air Force Base to test weapons within the core habitat during an authorization renewal. The base frequently conducts tests in the northeastern GOMx with the potential to inflict considerable harm to nearby cetaceans [48]. The NMFS is mandated to review the military\u2019s plans to ensure minimal damage to marine mammals without seriously hampering national defense capabilities. Sometimes accidental harm can\u2019t be avoided, so the NMFS can invoke exemptions in the MMPA and ESA if necessary [39, 48]. By choosing to safeguard the Rice\u2019s whales, the NMFS set an important precedent on how valuable protecting the endangered species is. But this is vulnerable to shifting political landscapes. Opposing the decision was far-right US congressman Matt Gaetz, who tried to see Rice\u2019s whale protections rolled back. Claiming that 51 poorly-known whales should not stand in the way of conflict readiness [49], he went as far as to personally introduce legislation to exempt the species from the MMPA [50]. While Gaetz\u2019s efforts ultimately failed, this demonstrates the political dangers entangling the Rice\u2019s whales.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Towards a future for the whales and us</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While successes occur in core habitat, none of these measures cover the western secondary habitats. The secondary isn\u2019t as formally defined as the core yet, but another reason why the NMFS can act swiftly in the core habitat may be because the area sees comparatively little economic pursuits. This is in part due to a congressional moratorium on offshore drilling in the eastern GOMx recently extended by President Trump until 2032 [51]. On the other hand, the majority of oil rigs and vessel activity operate in the western and central GOMx (Figure 2). The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Deepwater Horizon</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> spill must remind us of the ease of spillovers into the core habitat. Additionally, whales that venture westward (as confirmed by an acoustic survey [52]) face the brunt of marine industrialization. Any resulting deaths are detrimental to the 51 remaining whales. Protecting these corridors are therefore as important as protecting the core habitat.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The unfortunate reality is that Americans still rely heavily on GOMx oil [53], so an immediate prohibition isn\u2019t feasible. Instead, we must take steps to reduce the impact of existing oil activities while progressively phasing out the industry. In the short term, we ought to demand better government oversight on oil regulations to hold the accountability necessary to prevent negligent spills. In the meantime, the 2021 NMFS workshop also recommended a clean-up: decommissioning the over 14,000 defunct oil wells at risk of spills [43, 54]. While President Biden has since signed into law the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that funds such efforts, the $4.7 billion set aside [55] is a small fry to the estimated $30 billion needed to neutralize all disused GOMx wells [54]. Raising this requires joint political action and/or grassroots fundraising. In the long term, we must collectively discourage oil expansion by supporting renewable energy. This isn\u2019t just innovation; it also means bottom-up environmental justice that opens accessibility to marginalized groups least likely to afford clean technologies. But as we develop renewables, the NMFS workshop emphasized mindfulness to prevent potential harms to the Rice\u2019s whales: poorly-placed marine infrastructure can introduce debris hazards and exacerbate shipping traffic and underwater noise, avoidable through robust spatial planning [43].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Long-term change towards a green future also addresses another fundamental challenge to the Rice\u2019s whales\u2019 future: climate change. With their reliance on a single prey, Rice\u2019s whales are especially vulnerable to the unraveling crisis. The core habitat\u2019s location is no coincidence: it\u2019s within one of the most silver-rag-abundant regions in the northern GOMx [56]. This is thanks to the area\u2019s unique position between the fresh nutrient-rich Mississippi River Delta, the warm Loop Current, and upwelling from the De Soto Canyon, mixing the three waters to produce a highly productive environment [11, 57]. The Loop Current is part of the thermohaline circulation (THC), earth\u2019s global ocean conveyor belt, powered by optimal water temperature and salinity. But as the planet warms, the THC weakens. This diminishes the Loop Current [58], threatening the water-mixing that enriches the core habitat and therefore the abundance of silver-rags that sustain the Rice\u2019s whales. This isn\u2019t an isolated relationship: countless animals globally rely on few resources that may be lost due to climate-induced habitat disruption [59]. By acting to protect and recover the Rice\u2019s whales with a climate mindset addressing big oil and other industrializers of the Gulf, we are not just \u201csaving the whales\u201d: we are also setting a precedent for tackling the looming global catastrophe faced by everyone everywhere.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>We have power in the word</h4></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A most important component to recovering the Rice\u2019s whale\u2013but one that lags behind\u2013is public awareness. Many Americans remain unaware of the Rice\u2019s whale\u2019s existence. While much can be done through policymaking by the NMFS and other government agencies, their top-down authority alone can only go so far when fundamental long-term and climate-allied change is ultimately necessary to truly pull back the critically endangered species. Rice\u2019s whales are under direct protection by some of the most powerful environmental laws in the world, but the effectiveness of this advantage depends on the willingness of the nation\u2019s citizens to push for lasting change in the GOMx.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Public awareness positively shapes the collective perspective. It combats disinformation [60], such as the false narrative that the new species\u2019 recognition was arbitrarily crafted by \u201csome scientist\u201d [47, 49] to push an agenda, and empowers stakeholders like local boaters to participate in policy-making. This removes barriers to the synthesis of valuable community experience with scientific knowledge into policies that both protects the Rice\u2019s whale and respects community needs. When people learn about species on the brink, it builds sympathy and determination to do what can be done to save them, inspiring political willpower to influence both citizen and government decisions from the bottom-up [61].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rice\u2019s whales hold strength through their potential to be a charismatic species: their enormous size to man\u2019s eyes captures the icon of a majestic gentle giant. Through its direct relationship with oil, the Rice\u2019s whale can be a flagship for what is preserved\u2013or destroyed\u2013by our choice on climate. Finally, the Rice\u2019s whale is all-American: no other nation can be responsible for its extinction; its fate is the reflection of how we as Americans treat the environment. It\u2019s why senior marine mammalogist Peter Corkeron of the New England Aquarium, one of the leading figures in the species\u2019 conservation effort, suggested </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Balaenoptera ricei</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is better called the \u201cAmerican whale\u201d [62].</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Informing the people about the Rice\u2019s whale, what our industrial actions are doing to them, and piquing a vision of a brighter future that could be\u2013a healthy Gulf of Mexico echoing with year-round songs of America\u2019s baleen whale, teeming with fish, dolphins, birds, and sea turtles fated not to an oily death but flourishing at a diversity imperceivable today alongside the whale that helped engineer its possibility\u2013is enough to inspire support for the cause.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The road ahead is hard, but there is power for wonderful change in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">you, the reader,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> through a simple action.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n<p><h4>Vp  You\u2019ve been described as the most prolific science fiction writer living today. I really want to know how this became your niche.</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KSR: I was reading fiction and Jules Verne fiction art adventures were exciting. At the end of my library\u2019s section, I began to explore the top of my head: life is really whatever and written before all its history, and if I wanted to write about the present, California, where they were more realistic, then which hit me like the graphics, the numbers. That\u2019s like getting creative and since then, I got married to a scientist and I\u2019ve been able to watch a real scientist work. So that\u2019s how once you publish it mostly to build up your getaway. It was a subculture that had a very particular audience and bookstores, in publishing</span></p>\n<p><h4>Vp  It\u2019s fascinating when you discuss the scientific community. I\u2019ve noticed that many scientific works seem to have a left-leaning political theme. Do scientist-writers aim for objectivity? I remember during one of your talks, you mentioned that when people claim to be against scientists, they\u2019re actually against the ownership of labor. Have you spoken to scientists or those in the science fiction community about this?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KSR: The political spectrum exists in all fields and communities, including science fiction and writing. From hardcore reactionary right-wingers and military science fiction libertarians to left liberals and the radical wing, the spectrum is vast. Personally, I align with the left, but I dislike the precise labeling that often happens, leading to internecine warfare and the narcissism of small differences. My characters express a range of opinions, and my own opinions are fluid. I was fortunate to be trained by Frederick Jamison, one of the most famous Marxist literary critics on Earth, and I still listen to his classes as podcasts. As a science fiction writer, I am interested in the birth and development of science, and how it works as a political force. I have explored this in my novels, including Shaman, which looked at the birth of science in the Paleolithic era, and in Galileo and the Years of Rising Salt, which imagined a scientific revolution occurring in a fictional culture where India, Islam, and China met. In my Washington DC trilogy, also known as Science in the Capitol or Green Earth, I examined how federal science works and its influence on policy. As a science fiction writer, I am always looking for new stories and exploring the role of science and scientists in society. The Mars trilogy was a turning point in my career, and science remains a prominent theme in all of my work</span></p>\n<p><h4>Vp  You wrote a book called New York 2150 In which New York was completely submerged, with the sea level going up 50 feet from where it is today. I don\u2019t know where the sea level is going to be by then, but what do you think about science fiction making predictions or\u00a0 placing readers in fear to prevent those predictions.</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KSR: One thing about the science fiction readership is that they are accustomed to playing the game of the genre, which means that this novel can be seen through two lenses. On the one hand, it is about the future, and on the other hand, it is about the present</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This novel is about our choices right now, and how we will cope with the future consequences.Some questions it answers are: How will humans cope?Specifically, how will they cope with the situation we would have left them with? They\u2019ll say look, this is what we got. I\u2019m going to try to find a partner, have a family, make some money, have some fun, all that will be on the minds of people.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Vp  You know, I think it\u2019s interesting that you mentioned things like humans coping with the future because I think you\u2019ve been described as an optimist about the climate crisis. I personally can\u2019t help but be a pessimist with regards to not only how we\u2019re dealing with the climate crisis now, but also things like capitalism and the modern rise of global fascism.</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KSR: I often recommend just giving up on optimism or pessimism. It will be interesting for you during the course of your lifetime\u2013you\u2019re going to see lots of losses and inappropriate behaviors by people who are, in effect, trying to wreck the world, for motives that are opaque even to themselves. A lot of good things are already started. And it\u2019s become a topic of interest. And I tell you, when I started writing science in the capital, it was just a science fiction story. It made a difference when Al Gore did the movie, An Inconvenient Truth, but it was an outlier opinion. Now it\u2019s the central story of history. And I\u2019m seeing private capital realizing that they can\u2019t make a profit if the world has gone crashing. So now private capital is interested. Could we still make a buck doing green work? That\u2019s a big jump. And it may or may not be true because the inherent rules of capitalism are unjust, they\u2019re extractive, and this is all very straightforward leftism. They\u2019re made for the rich: the rich extract value and ruin people\u2019s lives. They misery people and scare them so that the people will take any job they can stay alive, while the rich live off of an obscene amount of wealth.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And we can beat these guys, because a lot of them are older, they\u2019re my generation, a lot of them will die out and there will be a new structure of feeling. And this is another leftist concept and it has to do with the general intellect or what is common sense, what everybody just thinks of as normal. And by the time your generation takes over power, then saving the biosphere is going to be seen as normal. It won\u2019t be as contested as now because there\u2019ll be that many disasters and there\u2019ll be that many solutions.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It does seem to represent to me a full employment program. Young people, especially young intellectuals, but in fact all young people, they\u2019re going to have jobs. People are going to be begging them, because you got to take care of the old people. You got to green the world. And you\u2019ve got to grow the food and make the machinery there\u2019s more work to be done, then there\u2019s going to be humans after the baby boomer pulse dies out.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It won\u2019t just be flipping burgers or doing Starbucks; that\u2019ll be necessary but that will probably be even those jobs. They\u2019re going to have to be offered an adequate living wage or else nominal take that job because they can take care of old people or they can go out and work in some kind of green industry. The clean transition already needs more. We need more electricians and more engineers than we have right now. And it goes on and on like that.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And now I\u2019m talking about ministry for the future. I\u2019m talking to all these power centers, and they are almost all being run by people 20 or 30 years younger than me. They\u2019re smart,well educated, and determined to do good and are in positions of power.. So the baby boomers of my generation, accomplish a lot, fail a lot, but are becoming irrelevant. They\u2019re saying things like, \u201c I\u2019m going to become a technocrat, I\u2019m going to work for the government\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m going to work in the international diplomatic world. And I\u2019m going to try to make changes.\u201d \u201c I\u2019m going to make a billion and then I\u2019m going to throw that billion into good causes.\u201d This kind of affective Altruism, which is interesting and kind of bogus. But on the other hand, I have seen many billionaires and Silicon Valley who love science fiction. I met a lot of these people, and they are actually very smart and they want to make sure that the biosphere survives. They have justice as a goal.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Dr. Robinson then delved into various ideas pitched to him by said \u201ctechnocrats,\u201d each with their fair shares of upsides and downsides. Some of the topics included pumping water from Antarctica, utilizing an industrial process to mechanically drive Carbon back into soil, and other potential agricultural techniques.</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KSR: This is a great opportunity for for UC Davis for Regenerative AG. I mean that I think is the project for your generation is and then as I always say the economics, you know, you\u2019ve got to be able to make a living doing that you don\u2019t want to make everybody say to everybody, oh, you need to go bankrupt or you need to do this as charity on the margin. You have to be able to make your living at it. And that this is where looking at that IRA bill is simply saying, Look, we\u2019ll give you money if you do the right thing. And if that was expanded out as a general principle then you get to the carbon coin, et cetera, and then you can make your living doing green things. It\u2019s there it\u2019s on the table. It\u2019s just incoherent and it\u2019s got enemies that would like to kill it in the cradle for reasons that are a little bit ugly.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Our discussion then went to places outside of Uc Davis. Dr. Robinson mentioned the International \u201c4 per 1000\u201d Initiative, launched by France in 2015, signifying a goal to increase carbon fixation in soil by .4% every year. The world\u2019s soils contain 2 to 3 times more carbon than the atmosphere, so increasing fixation every year should significantly reduce the Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere.</h4></p>\n<p><h4>Vp  I also kind of want to give us give some space for you to just talk about \u201cthe new Green Revolution\u201d as you\u2019ve called it. How can readers of the Aggie Transcript and Uc Davis students be a part of it?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">KSR: Here\u2019s where I gotta say, I am a student trying to learn. Your readers will after a couple classes know more about it than I do. I think I mean, there\u2019s things about it that immediately make me wonder, can this work? Like no till agriculture. So you then suddenly you don\u2019t plow the soil anymore, and you begin to work in perennials rather than annuals and the carbon needs to be sequestered in part by not disturbing the soil. That strikes me as an awesome ask but are there other ways to sequester carbon in soil? We got nitrogen fixers are all around us right now are there carbon fixers Well, there are but can we eat them etc. I\u2019m not well versed in this and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a good tutorial on it that I\u2019ve missed. Or if it doesn\u2019t exist, and it\u2019s still a project to be theorized. But the people I keep asking, this village itself is filled with people from UC Davis agriculture who live here. I keep asking them, What do you think about this and they\u2019re like, work in progress, or it\u2019s some or it\u2019s some think tanks idea that it\u2019s actually harder than hell in practice, which may be true. That\u2019s part of my research right now: trying to find out more about what regenerative agriculture would imply.</span></p>\n</div>",

        "title": "The Use of Stem Cells to Treat Alzheimer\u2019s Disease",
        "author": "Tara Nguyen, Human Development, \u201925",
        "date": "06/13/2023",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive and motor functions to worsen over time, eventually leading to the loss of day-to-day function [1]. AD is the fifth leading cause of death in individuals aged 65 and older. Other causes of death within the top five, such as stroke and cardiac arrest, have decreased in numbers since 2000 while deaths from AD have increased by over 145% [2]. In 2022, an estimated $321 billion was spent on long-term and hospice care for AD patients older than 65 years, an increase from $234 billion as recently as 2019 [1-2]. This piece will cover the pathogenesis of AD and how stem cell research is contributing to finding a successful treatment for AD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the foremost signs in the pathogenesis of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptides, 39-43 residue amino acids derived from the irregular activity of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) [3-4]. The A\u03b2 peptide forms plaque deposits in areas of the brain that control memory function such as the medial temporal lobe and the neocortical structures [4-5]. The impacts of plaque deposits in these areas of the brain include impaired memory, attention, thought, and perception.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The other most common sign in the development of AD is the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which occur due to the misfolding of tau proteins. Tau is an important microtubule protein that takes on six distinct isotypes, each with its own precise function. This protein is important in maintaining the stability of the microtubule system, which contributes majorly to axonal transport [6]. In axonal transport, motor proteins use microtubule systems to transport proteins between neurons. Without stable microtubule systems for this transport, the development, function, and survival of nerves are inhibited [7]. Hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein leads to its overexpression and aggregation, meaning that the microtubule system which tau maintains will no longer be stable. This means that nerve transport, development, function, and survival will be impacted, and NFTs will propagate in the neuronal space of patients with AD. Furthermore, the overexpression of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins can lead to the damage and loss of neurons [6].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most cells in the human body are specialized cells, such as those that make up the nervous system or the cells that function in the liver. However, there are cells that have regenerative abilities and, unlike specialized cells, are not restricted to one specific function: stem cells. Stem cells provide opportunities for research into regenerative medicine due to their ability to specialize into different cells of various functions rather than only into one. Specifically, multipotent stem cells (MSCs) can specialize into cells from one particular organ or system. For example, neural stem cells (NSCs) are MSCs in the central nervous system that have the ability to differentiate into all nervous system cells. While these cells are indeed stem cells, they only have the potency to specialize into neural system and related cells.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2009, a study focusing on NSCs was completed at the University of California, Irvine\u2019s Department of Neurobiology and Behavior Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders by Mathew Blurton-Jones et al. This study used transgenic mice models that expressed features of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, such as pathogenic forms of APP and phosphorylated tau proteins [8]. However, instead of targeting these pathogenic hallmarks of AD, researchers transplanted NSCs into the hippocampus of these mice [8].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite there being no change to the amounts of APP present or the tangles in phosphorylated tau proteins, this study found that cognitive function of these mice improved through brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which mediates the survival and growth of neurons in the central nervous system [8]. While the hallmarks of AD were still present in these mice, they were able to regain some cognitive function.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another study done by I.S. Kim et al, in cooperation with the Yonsei University College of Medicine in South Korea in 2015, used stem cells to investigate potential therapeutic effects in AD. Like the study by Blurton-Jones et al, this study utilized NSCs in a transgenic mouse model. The transgenic mouse model had a neuronal disease state that resembles that of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease with features including damaged neurons, an excess of APP, and phosphorylated tau proteins [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This study found that non-engineered human NSCs, when inserted into this transgenic mouse model, inhibited the phosphorylation of tau in the model by interfering with the related signaling pathways [9]. As previously discussed, the overexpression of phosphorylated tau is one of the causes of damaged neurons, a primary cause of AD. The researchers hope that a similar effect may show in humans, since the insertion of human NSCs into the transgenic mouse model was able to limit one of the factors and indicators of the development of AD [9].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Further studies are needed to determine whether or not stem cells can prove truly useful in the treatment of AD. Studies that have been approved and published thus far have shown a hopeful light towards the usefulness of stem cells in the modeling and treatment of AD. The works of Matthew Blurton-Jones et al. and I.S. Kim et al. provide a stepping stone towards a working treatment to inhibit, or even reverse, the effects of AD. Some next steps may include researching a possible solution for A\u03b2 plaques, or finding solutions to consider both NFTs and A\u03b2 plaques, and these studies may, hopefully, help the process of developing a successful treatment for AD in humans.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c2019 Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Facts and Figures.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alzheimer\u2019s &amp; Dementia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> 15, no. 3 (2019): 321\u201387. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2019.01.010.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2022 alzheimer\u2019s disease facts and figures.

He looked like a laureate in the light, with a crown of olive branches placed upon his wide-brimmed field hat. We were taking Intro to Sustainable Agriculture together, and I had heard how he wanted to do a community olive harvest this weekend at the Student Farm, a 23 acre agriculture program at UC Davis. I was next door when I came across him and his friends talking around a field bin, strategizing the day forthcoming. Later, I would join him in the orchard, amazed at the crowd of people collected, the energy exuding from them as joyous as a traditional field harvest.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d he told me \u201cthat they were just going to let the olives rot on the tree instead of doing something with them\u201d.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">He had learned through a friend that the olive grove at the Student Farm would not be harvested this season. There was simply not enough manpower. Within a week, he had organized a team effort and convinced the head of the Student Farm to let him and his friends hand-pick as many olives as they could and bring them to a community milling project outside of Livermore, CA. One had a truck, another brought music and blankets, and yet another brought more friends until this manual labor event seemed more like a block party, with clean, empty, dark wine bottles collected to later fill up with the products of their harvest.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sam quickly gave me the safety rundown \u2013 and Tim gave me the waiver to sign, pinky promising to not sue if my head gets chopped off in the process. The ground under the grove was littered with ankle-splintering holes, dug by ground squirrels to nest close to a fallen food source. I carefully stepped my way to a tree, where a nice girl introduced herself and showed me the strategy for harvesting the olives \u2013 taking a big stick, usually with a rake attached to the end of it, and smacking the hell out of the branches, pushing and pulling to entice the tree to release some of her swollen fruit. Together we took turns bashing, raking, holding, and scrubbing until the tarp under us was littered with ripe, firm, green olives. We each grabbed two ends and brought our bounty over to the sorting groups, who cheered as we deposited our load into piles.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4723 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"247\" sizes=\"(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-200x133.jpg 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-272x182.jpg 272w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-300x200.jpg 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-400x267.jpg 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-600x400.jpg 600w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-768x512.jpg 768w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-800x533.jpg 800w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1054-scaled.jpg 2560w\" width=\"371\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I sat down in one of the circles, and a neighbor showed me exactly how they picked which olives were good and could be pressed and milled, and which were bad and would spoil the batch. Crouched on my feet, I scooped up a handful and admired the pale farina clouding the surface of the fruit. Slowly, I turned it around in my hand, looking for pits or worms or the dreaded Olive Fruit Fly, before tossing it in the \u201cGood\u201d basket. Around me, the fellow harvesters who had been doing this for hours already would scoop up a handful while chatting, roll it around in their palms as they scanned, and quickly made their selection of good and bad fruits, all while singing, chatting, and joking around while the music played. Clearly, there was a rhythm I had to learn.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In case you were ever interested in the selection process for these olives, here\u2019s what you looked for: a uniform color on a solid, firm skin, no holes or lesions, and especially no scales or larvae. Olives naturally had small pits and divots, but the key difference was the indication of something burrowing into or out of the flesh and skin of the fruit.\u00a0 The Olive Fruit Fly, an invasive pest that destroys the olive crop in this way, would spoil the batch if too many were detected. Their life cycle depends on laying their eggs in forgotten, fallen crops, and we had to be careful to properly dispose of rejected fruits lest we exacerbate the problem in next year\u2019s harvest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If we hadn\u2019t collected these olives \u2013 even though we left many on the trees \u2013 the ground would be littered with rotting olives, a useful food source for pesky pests and other critters on the student farm. It would also be a habitat for insects, like the Olive Fruit Fly, and could bolster their population the following year, even spreading to and worsening the situation on neighboring farms. We made sure all of the soft, scarred, and unsavory olives made their way into the compost pile, so they could be repurposed as agricultural waste into food for next season\u2019s crops.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As I got into the groove of things, another neighbor made a joke about working under the warm sun. \u201cI can feel my Greek ancestors frowning at me, going \u2018We left for America so you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">wouldn\u2019t</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> be doing farmwork!\u2019\u201d The group laughed at his joke, but it had me thinking about my own connections to the olives, how this group of harvesters made me feel more connected to my ancestors than any other part of modern life.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instead, olive tree growers in the south Mediterranean have their own pest problems to worry about. A new virus, called xyzella fastidiosa, has infected thousands of olive trees in Italy and has ravaged orchards [3]. With no natural defense against the introduced pathogen, farmers are having to pull every trick out of their toolbox to protect their trees before it totally destroys the industry, or spreads to any neighboring countries. An already parched basin, Italy and other olive-producing countries have faced drought and intense heat as climate change spreads, altering the global weather patterns. Coupled with these pre-existing climate troubles with the desertification of the Mediterranean, the olive industry, which has flourished for thousands of years in the fertile valleys of southern Europe, is on the ropes.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the day stretched on, we all grew hungry and tired under the warm sun, standing up to stretch and daring each other to eat the tempting fruit we were sorting under our fingers. Unfortunately, uncured olives like the ones we were handling taste extremely bitter, and the offensive taste tends to linger in one\u2019s mouth. By the time the sun started setting, we had almost filled the entirety of the truck bed up with gorgeous, colorful olives, ranging from candy apple green to a wine-dark skin. We had only harvested from 6 of the 28 trees in the grove, with not enough people or time to attack the entire orchard in the limited sunlight. Sam and Tim rounded up the last buckets, as everyone helped fold up tarps, put away supplies, and swapped photos taken of the harvest. The next day, Sam and Tim would drive down to the Olivina, an olive orchard and mill in Livermore, that participated in a once-yearly Community Milling Day, where we could get our olives milled for free. In order to make the freshest extra virgin olive oil, we had to get these picked olives milled as quickly as possible, within 24 hours. Promises were made to meet back up in a week, where a taste-testing party with bread would be provided at the Domes.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4725 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"277\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-300x200.jpg\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-200x133.jpg 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-272x182.jpg 272w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-300x200.jpg 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-400x267.jpg 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-600x400.jpg 600w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-768x512.jpg 768w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-800x533.jpg 800w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/06/QGIMG_1058-scaled.jpg 2560w\" width=\"416\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the end of the day, I brought my hands up to my face and inhaled deeply at the fresh, earthy smell of olives still dusting my hands, the farina settled and coating the crevices of my hands and nail beds. Within a week, I was meeting up with Sam and Tim again, and finally getting my own bottle of this liquid gold. A total of 470 lbs of olives were harvested, resulting in 10 gallons of oil to distribute. Gathered around the tasting table, I nabbed some bread and took a dunk in the oil. Instead of a mellow flavor most grocery store oils held, this tasted like a kick in the teeth, the peppery notes coating my mouth and tingling on the way down. Paired with bread and balsamic, or added into a focaccia recipe, this hand-harvested olive oil tasted like satisfaction and a hard day\u2019s sweat under the sun, with the benefit of caring for the land and next year\u2019s crop.</span></p>\n</div>",

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s note</h4> This past quarter I took ANT158, Evolution of Sex: A Biological Perspective. I had falsely believed prior that most of our understanding of sex and sexuality was from a psychological perspective resulting from differences in hormonal cascades that occurred before birth. It was enlightening to learn about evolutionary theories behind sexuality, the relatively high frequency of intersexed individuals, and how different cultures are shaped because of it. For this paper, I wanted to focus on two groups I was previously unaware had so many biological basises; intersexed individuals and trans individuals. I hope to help someone correct misconceptions such as the fallacy that according to biology, there are only two genders.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many understand the difference in sexes as a difference in gonads, or reproductive parts. Males have testes and females have ovaries, with the growth of each determined by hormonal cascades. However, many do not understand that even sex exists on a spectrum; if a gene is not expressed or a hormone is not released, there may be a mismatch between the genetic code and the expression of that code for the individual. Such individuals fit the intersexed definition, though an exact definition of what an intersexed individual is has been a subject of controversy in the scientific community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Perhaps one of the most important contributors to the acceptance of intersex individuals as something more than fringe cases was Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling, who published a number of books and papers on intersex individuals. In a literature review summarizing research from the 1950\u2019s to 2000, Fausto-Sterling and colleagues first presented the notion that the percentage of intersex individuals in the population may be as high as 2% [1]. In this paper, they defined intersex as any individual that deviates from the idea that there are only two sexes via a wide variety of biomarkers. These deviations can present themselves in chromosomal, gonadal, or hormonal levels in individuals. In other words, the key difference between transsexuals and intersexed individuals is that intersexed individuals always have some kind of observable biological element, and there are a wide array of markers. Transsexuals simply have to identify as something besides their gender assigned at birth, and some may have biological markers associated with the opposite sex and others may not. A famous example of a biological marker in transsexuals, the BSTc region of the brain, is discussed further.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In her 2012 book, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sex/Gender: Biology in a Social World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Fausto-Sterling expands more towards brain-sex and the potential mismatch between physical characteristics and their gender identity. A misunderstanding of what brain-sex is may be a contributing factor to the perpetuation of gender being the only thing on a spectrum. Brain-sex refers to the complicated ways in which hormones, gene expression and genetic imprinting by the father and/or mother affects the child and the way their brain works. It is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">not </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">limited to how a person perceives their sex, and this myth may contribute to the idea that gender and sex are completely different and one (sex) refers to biology and the other (gender) to the brain\u2019s perception of identity. In reality, both are linked to biology [2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite these efforts, sex existing on a spectrum is still challenged. In 2002 for example, Leonard Sax posited that the rate of intersexed individuals was much lower\u2014around 0.018% [3]. However, Sax came to this number through a strangely strict definition of intersex; Sax posits that if an individual had an XXY chromosome and had some cells with XX and others with XY configuration, this person would not be intersexed, as their cells technically match their chromosomes. To be intersexed according to Sax, someone must have a mismatch between phenotypic sex and genotypic sex. For example, a person under Sax\u2019s definition would be intersex if they had Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, if they had XY chromosomes but they never developed male genitalia due to a defect in androgen receptors [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Such a definition, however, is comparatively much less valuable than what Fausto-Sterling tells us. Her definition of intersex is simply being somewhere in between a man and a woman, and her definition seeks to dismantle the myth that there are only two sexes. While detractors claim that they seek a more clinically rigorous definition, like Sax, it is possible that it furthers the myth that intersex individuals are simply outliers in society, and sex exists in a binary system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similarly, if we understand that we can exist on a sexual spectrum, it becomes understandable why transgender individuals, or people that want to switch the gender imposed on them due to their genitalia, exist in society. In addition to the research conducted by Fausto-Sterling indicating a disconnect between external genitalia and internal genes and hormones, there is other clear evidence showing a biological basis for transgendered individuals. Specifically, a study conducted by Zhou and colleagues examined the volume of the central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a white matter band that acts as a relay site during a stress response. The BSTc is essential for sexual behavior due to multiple reasons, but perhaps most importantly, it is the major center of the aromatization process essential in converting testosterone to estrogen, the two most common male and female growth hormones [4]. It also forms unique connections with the amygdala and hypothalamus, making it highly influential in growth and development. Uniquely, the BSTc region is much larger in males than females, and is directly related to the testosterone and/or estrogen it helps create and regulate. Zhou and colleagues found that the BSTc region among transgendered women and non-transgendered women, where neither groups were on any kind of hormonal therapy that would affect the size of their BSTc, were similar in size. This female brain structure in a genetically male individual supports the notion that gender identity develops as a result of the developing brain [4].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the research base for transgendered and intersexed individuals is very strong, cultural pushback is rooted in either misinformation or a sense of feeling threatened transgendered individuals. One prominent example of this can be seen in their participation in sports. Over the years, the regulation of trans peoples\u2019 participation in sports has led to absurd levels of regulation, notably for people that do not identify as trans. Most famously are the numerous cases against Caster Semenya, multi-gold winning olympic track athlete, on the basis of testosterone, a shaky metric. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) currently states that to compete in the olympics, a woman should have testosterone levels below 5 nmol/L. Otherwise, they must compete as a male or receive testosterone blockers to compete as a female. However, in a review of nearly 700 elite athletes, Healy and colleagues found that 16.5% of men had testosterone levels below the 5 nmol/L limit and 13.7% women had testosterone levels above the limit [5]. The IAAF conducted their own study that upheld their regulations, but importantly, they opted to exclude outliers that they deemed having \u201cdifferences of sexual development,\u201d something they have been criticized for but have not rectified as of the publishing of this paper [6]. These discriminatory practices perhaps further fuel ignorance on the subject of intersexed individuals, and do not properly tackle biology in sexuality.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The reality is that human beings are more complicated than we\u2019d like to admit. \u201cBodies are not bounded,\u201d Fausto-Sterling emphasizes in the conclusion to her book. \u201cWe will learn a lot about the science of sex and gender in the years to come. But to the extent that our social settings and thus experiences change, at least some of the subtleties of sex and gender will remain a moving target\u201d [2].</span></p>\n<p><h4>REFERENCES</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blackless, M., Charuvastra, A., Derryck, A., Fausto-Sterling, A., Lauzanne, K., &amp; Lee, E.

Well, let me tell you about another technique that has been proven to be more accurate and efficient than CRISPR systems. It\u2019s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">prime editing</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> \u2013 a method of genome editing that utilizes a single stranded nick to edit DNA! I first learnt about prime editing from my then graduate student mentor, Dr. Peter Lynagh, while I was working in the Comai Lab at UC Davis. I remember scouring the internet for papers and looking up applications of this revolutionary technology, as it fascinated me beyond measure. So naturally, when we were tasked with writing a scientific review for my UWP 102B class, I had to write about this! Prime editing is an up-and-coming tool in gene editing, and I hope through my review, readers with basic to intermediate understanding of molecular genetics are able to share my amazement and admiration for prime editing!</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Current methods of genome editing involve a double stranded break on the DNA molecule, thus involving high frequency of unwanted base pair insertion/deletions (indels) and off-target effects in the repair process. Some are relatively limited in scope in terms of the length of the edit and specific type of base pair substitution. Recently, a new technique called prime editing has been developed which creates a single stranded break and shows high accuracy and editing proficiency along with minimal off-target effects in the genome. The molecular machinery of prime editing is very accurate; it recognizes the region of interest in the genome and is precisely able to insert an edited DNA sequence. In this review we discuss the mechanics of prime editing, compare it to other methods of genome editing, and investigate its applications as well as limitations in the health field. Numerous papers from the PubMed database point towards the potential of prime editing in repairing disease-causing mutations in humans. However, researchers are not using it for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">experiments (experiments that take place in a whole living organism) just yet, as they believe we need to learn a lot more about safe methods of delivery to human cell lines, side effects of the treatment, and overall efficiency of editing. Regardless, a lot of progress is consistently being made, including optimization of the prime editing machinery, online search databases, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ex-vivo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> applications. With the current pace of scientific discovery, the goal of using prime editing to its full potential will become reality soon enough.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Keywords</h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: single-stranded break, genome editing, CRISPR-Cas9, guideRNA, disease-causing mutation repair.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2019, Dr. David Liu published a paper introducing a new method of genome editing called prime editing (PE). The method is novel in its approach since it surpasses a majority of the drawbacks of pre-existing methods of genome engineering such as base editing (BE) and Clusters of Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein (Cas9), a method of genome editing adapted from the bacterial immune system\u2019s defense mechanism. The main reason why PE is able to overcome these drawbacks is because it involves a single stranded break on the DNA molecule, as opposed to CRISPR-Cas9 which involves a double-stranded break (DSB), thus significantly reducing unwanted indels in the genome [1]. So far, a lot of studies have compared the efficiencies of PE with BE and CRISPR-Cas9. PE has been put to use in modeling diseases in organoids (tissue cultures that mimic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> organs) and researchers are developing ways of correcting the mutations that cause these diseases. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In theory, PE could correct 90% of all disease-causing mutations in humans </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[2]. However, the unanimous opinion remains: a lot of work needs to be done in the field before PE can be used to correct mutations in a safe manner </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[1], [3], [4].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this review I will investigate the mechanism and scope of prime editing and see how it can be used to study disease-causing mutations. By analyzing the technique and comparing it against the existing and well researched types of genome-editing, I will investigate PE\u2019s effectiveness in repairing these mutations and see how the mechanism can be optimized.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>How does Prime Editing work?</h4></p>\n<p><h4>Mechanism</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The prime editing system is based off of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system. In CRISPR-Cas9, there is a single-stranded, guide RNA molecule (sgRNA) that is complementary to a specific region of the DNA and it is associated with a DNA endonuclease enzyme, Cas9. The sgRNA searches for and binds to the sequence homologies within the genome. Directed by the sgRNA to this complementary region of interest, the Cas9 protein then cuts the DNA, creating a DSB[2]. This DSB can then be repaired by double-strand break repair processes of varying levels of efficiency. In the case of prime editing, we still have the guide RNA, but it is modified such that it includes the sequence of our desired edit (referred to as prime editing guide RNA or pegRNA). Further, the Cas9 protein is partially inactivated (referred to as Cas9-nickase) such that it only cuts the 3\u2019 strand of the complementary region on the DNA- creating a single stranded break [5]. And this makes all the difference.\u00a0 Since PE involves a single stranded break, the machinery doesn\u2019t rely on the inefficient and unpredictable DSB repair mechanisms.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The single stranded break caused by Cas9 nickase leads to the formation of a 3\u2019 DNA flap. This flap binds to a sequence on the pegRNA called the primer binding site (PBS). The reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is fused to Cas9 nickase, elongates the DNA using the 3\u2019 flap as a primer, thus synthesizing a new \u201cedited\u201d DNA strand. The newly edited strand can then be incorporated into the original DNA molecule through a number of ways. The various approaches through which this resolution happens makes up the different kinds of prime editing.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4461 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"479\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-57.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-57-200x187.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-57-300x281.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-57-400x374.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-57.png 512w\" width=\"512\"/></span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reproducible Graphic : </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The mechanics of prime editing</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.synthego.com/guide/crispr-methods/prime-editing\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">https://www.synthego.com/guide/crispr-methods/prime-editing</span></i></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Types of Prime Editing</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The mechanism PE1 relies on an endogenous endonuclease \u2013 FEN1, which cuts the 5\u2019 end of our unedited DNA so that it doesn\u2019t come in the way of our edited strand. With this cut, our edited DNA is thermodynamically favored to bind to the original DNA molecule. For PE2, the Liu group modified the sequence of RT to increase its thermostability, binding to DNA template and enzyme processivity. To take the mechanism to the next level, Anzalone et al. developed PE3 where they introduced a </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">second guide RNA</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (gRNA) molecule that creates a 5\u2019 nick on the non-edited strand, which allows for the edited DNA strand to be used as a template to complete the process. Finally, we have PE3b in which the gRNA is programmed such that it creates the 5\u2019 nick only after the edited strand has been completely formed [5]. This approach led to reduced indel formation and improved editing. According to Anzalone et al., PE3 is 1.5 to 4.2-fold more efficient than PE2. PE3b, while not showing a significantly higher editing efficiency, has a 13-fold reduction in indel formation [2].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To summarize, the way PE works is by utilizing a special RNA molecule called pegRNA that encodes our desired DNA edit and targets the exact region of DNA where the edit has to be incorporated</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Along with the Cas-9 nickase, it accurately creates a single stranded break, synthesizes the edited DNA, and finally incorporates the edit through various mechanisms \u2013 PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE3b.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Why is Prime Editing the best genome editing method we know?</h4></p>\n<p><h4>Prime Editing versus Crispr-Cas9</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are multiple characteristics of PE that make it better than our pre-existing methods of genome editing.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, PE involves a single stranded break in the DNA as opposed to CRISPR-Cas9 editing which involves a double stranded break (DSB). A DSB can be repaired in one of two ways \u2013 via homology directed repair (HDR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The latter leads to a lot of indels. Thus, the editing efficiency of genome editing methods employing DSB\u2019s is low. In contrast, PE doesn\u2019t involve a DSB to begin with, thus the process of repairing the break doesn\u2019t rely on the generation of random indels. Chemello et. al showed how the mutations causing Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) are corrected with less unwanted effects via PE as opposed to CRISPR-Cas9 [4].They used prime editing to correct one of the most common mutations of DMD \u2013 the deletion of exon 51. Chemello et al. first attempted to restore the correct open reading frame (ORF) by inducing exon skipping. They used CRISPR Cas9 to systematically make two cuts such that exon 52 would be skipped, and the ORF would be restored. However they were unsuccessful due to the high rate of indels and off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9. On the other hand, with PE, they were able to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">reframe </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the exon and precisely inserted two nucleotides into exon 52, thus bypassing the need for exon skipping entirely. This demonstrates the ability of PE to specifically target and edit DNA sequences in order to correct disease-causing mutations without the unwanted effects of double-stranded break repair pathways.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Further, since PE requires 3 separate hybridization events (pegRNA spacer to target DNA for Cas9 binding, pegRNA PBS to target DNA, and target DNA 3\u2019\u00a0 flap to RT product) to occur, it has significantly less off-target effects in the genome. In CRISPR-Cas9,\u00a0 the guide RNA, as it is searching DNA for complementarity, can bind to other regions of the genome with similar sequences, leading to DSB\u2019s in places that were not targeted [2]. Kim et al. were unsuccessful in trying to correct DMD using CRISPR-Cas9, due to these off-target effects. However, they found no significant unwanted indels in the genome of mice hepatocytes that were prime edited to correct for HT1 [6]. Similarly, Geurts et al. performed whole genome sequence analysis on prime edited five colon organoids and reported no mutational differences among the edited organoid sequences [3]. These findings establish the safety of PE as compared to CRISPR-Cas9.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Prime Editing versus base editing</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PE\u2019s battle with base editing is not as one-sided as it is with CRISPR Cas9. Base\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">editing performs rather well in most experiments.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are two kinds of base editing \u2013 adenine base editing that can change a nucleotide from A to G or G to A, and cytosine base editing, which changes C to T or T to C. The mechanism involves an inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) fused to a deaminase molecule which makes the respective base change possible [1]. Base editing doesn\u2019t involve a break on the DNA molecule at all.\u00a0 It also doesn\u2019t rely on the generation of random indels for editing. Hence, it is not surprising that the efficiency of this method surpasses that of PE. Geurts et al. reported that base editing induced correct mutations in 50% of the colonic organoids whereas prime editing was only able to reach 22% [3]. Similarly, Schene et al. found that using PE for the correction of mutations in liver organoids was less effective than using base editing. In this way, both papers report the same finding \u2013 when working with a mutation that can be corrected by base editing, it outperforms PE.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But here is the catch. First, base editing can make only four of the twelve possible base pair changes. If the disease of interest requires an adenine to be corrected into a cytosine, base editing doesn\u2019t even come into the picture\u2013 that substitution is beyond its capability. This severely limits the scope of genome editing. The second drawback deals with the size of the edit. Some diseases require a stretch of nucleotides to be corrected\u2013 not just a single nucleotide. If the editing window for BE is increased to more than one nucleotide, especially if the edit includes more A or C bases, a lot of by-stander edits are observed. This is because the Cas9-deaminase complex makes all base substitutions in its range, including those we don\u2019t want [2]. This problem doesn\u2019t arise in PE because the pegRNA encodes highly specific DNA insertions up to 80 base pairs in length. Because 98-99% of insertions, deletions and duplications in the pathogenic human genetic variants are smaller than 30 base pairs, researchers have claimed that with PE, we will be able to correct 90% of disease-causing mutations in humans [1].</span></p>\n<p><h4>What has been accomplished so far using Prime Editing?</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most sought-after goals of genome editing is to be able to correct diseases-causing mutations. While PE is being used increasingly for its precision in editing DNA, it is a relatively new technique and so all of the research takes place </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vitro</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> ( in an artificial environment simulated to mimic the human body). In the hopes of eventually overcoming this gap and moving on to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">studies, scientists are also working on optimizing PE to have even less off-target effects. They have varied the molecular machinery, model organoids that mimic </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">organ systems, and target mutations in different combinations, to find an approach with the best results. Optimization of the prime editing machinery is a well-established path to achieving the goal of using this technique in therapeutic applications.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Repair and modeling of disease-causing variants</h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prime editing has been successfully used to model several diseases in human organoids. Broadly speaking, there are two main goals of these particular studies. First, to study the efficiency of PE, and working on ways of improving the mechanism. Geurts et al. utilized PE to model the mutation causing cystic fibrosis in human adult derived colonic organoids and then used PE to correct the mutation. Scientists employed both PE and BE for these steps and found that BE was more efficient in inducing intended mutations as compared to PE, but again, it remains limited to 4 of the 12 base pair substitutions. They acknowledged that if edits need to be made outside of this window, PE is the best approach [3].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The second kind of PE editing studies investigate the ways in which disease-causing mutations can be corrected. Schene et al. modeled mutations in liver organoids to mimic the development of liver cancer, then used PE [1]. Schene et al. and Guerts et al. both confirmed that PE is the better choice only for the subset of mutations not applicable for correction using BE [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With that, it is quite clear that we need to work a lot more on PE to further increase its efficiency. To do this, multiple researchers are focusing their efforts on optimization of PE.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Optimization of pegRNA\u2019s</h4><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The prime editing machinery is highly advanced in structure. Compared to CRISPR-Cas9, there are fewer elements involved and thus less unwanted indels. The key player making this possible is the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Researchers have worked extensively on optimizing the performance of the pegRNA through a variety of approaches. Lin et al. identified two main factors that have shown increased efficiency of editing: first, designing primer binding sites (PBS) on the pegRNA with melting temperature less than 30 degrees Celsius, and second: using not one, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">two</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">pegRNA\u2019s encoding the same edit [7]. Together, these boost the editing efficiency 17.4-fold.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moreover, there is an increase in resources and tools for pegRNA optimization. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PegFinder </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is an online software that allows scientists to program the specific pegRNA to fit their experiment [3]. More recently, Lin et al describe the construction of their own web application called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PlantPegDesigner. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They claim that their tool is more user-friendly than PegFinder, as the latter necessitates experimental testing of pegRNA\u2019s. PlantPegDesigner only requires a single DNA sequence as an input and provides a variety of parameters to be optimized by the user \u2013 an ideal candidate pegRNA [7]. This technology has the potential to greatly simplify prime editing experiments with plants, which in turn might lead to quickly reducing the knowledge gap in the field. Another similar web application is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PrimeDesign \u2013 </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">a tool that not only provides the user with an ideal pegRNA but visualizes the entire prime editing event. It allows users to rank pegRNA\u2019s based on efficiency and includes extensive annotations. Additionally, Hsu et al. created a database called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PrimeVar</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> using all of these results, which can be used to search for pegRNA\u2019s correcting ~70,000 pathogenic human genetic variants [8].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prime editing is a novel breakthrough in the field of genome editing. It has been only three years since the publishing of Dr. David Liu\u2019s original paper introducing the world to PE. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">PE is able to target and edit any region of the genome while avoiding drawbacks of current gene-editing methods, made possible by the induction of a single stranded break. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scientists have demonstrated the superiority of PE when compared to base editing and CRISPR-Cas9 editing. BE, although more accurate and known for less off-target effects than PE, can only correct a subset of base-pair substitutions. CRISPR-Cas9 involves a double stranded break on the DNA molecule, leading to high rates of unwanted insertions/deletions in the genome as compared to PE. Within a span of two years, four distinct types of PE have been developed \u2013 PE1, PE2, PE3 and PE4 \u2013 each more efficient than the last. The development of online tools such as PrimeDesign and PlantPegDesigner show the rate at which scientists are making progress with PE. However, we are far from the finish line. Most researchers still remain skeptical about the use of PE for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in-vivo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> applications. While some say it is imperative to develop safe methods of delivery to human cell lines, others question the consequences of off-target effects in the genome. We don\u2019t fully understand how PE might affect other cells of the subject [2]. Additionally, researchers aren\u2019t certain about the longevity of prime edited disease corrections [4]. Most agree that in theory, prime editing will be revolutionary in terms of advancing human health, but given the relative recentness of the technology, there is still a lot of work to be done. Despite the gray area, PE certainly has a lot of potential and will be one of our strongest tools in improving human health in the future.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I.

It is a symbiotic bacterium that resides in the midgut of the mosquito </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anopheles gambiae, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">which resides in the Gambia River region in central Africa [2]. While </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A. gambiae</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is endemic to that region, outbreaks have been observed in several Asian and African countries, with </span>the biggest outbreak so far occurring in the United States<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Most cases of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are not due to direct contact with its host, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A. gambiae</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, but rather are community-acquired in hospitals through a yet undescribed method of transmission.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Diagnosis</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Clinical Presentation</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Typical symptoms of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> infection include bacteremia and meningitis. Pyrexia, chills, and dyspnea have also been observed across several case reports. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">presents the greatest bacterial burden in the blood, causing bacteremia that can lead to further complications such as sepsis and septic shock. Removal of catheters or central lines may be a necessary approach to relieve bacteremia when </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is suspected [3].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most of the information known about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has come from case reports, as an animal model has not been developed yet to examine its pathogenesis </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vivo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The first identified human case of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> infection was a case of neonatal meningitis in Africa. In this case, the 8-day-old patient experienced pyrexia, seizures, and apnea. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed hypoglycorrhachia [4]. In another case, a 7-month-old patient suffered from pyrexia, ecchymotic spots on the body, respiratory failure, and hemorrhaging [5]. These symptoms, however, are not considered to be within the standard clinical presentation of an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infection and would only be seen with an especially acute bacterial burden. In both cases, the final diagnosis of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infection was made after positive bacterial cultures were observed.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Diagnostic Criteria</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultures are a powerful tool in the diagnosis of bacterial infection and are grown by sampling many bodily fluids, although blood and CSF are the most common. Once cultures are grown, they can be analyzed to identify the specific bacterium or bacteria causing the infection. Common methods used to identify the different </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Elizabethkingia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> species have been unable to differentiate between </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. meningoseptica </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">with great accuracy. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, one of these common methods, utilizes a laser to ionize the bacterial sample and records the time it takes the ions to travel the length of a tube. Larger ions take a longer time, thus producing a mass spectrum that is known as a peptide mass fingerprint (PMF). The PMF of the sample is compared to the over 2,000 PMF of known bacteria species in the database [6].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MALDI-TOF mostly produces accurate identification of bacteria to the genus level. In combination with the lack of PMF samples of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">this method has caused many cases of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to be misidentified as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. meningoseptica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. However, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing has been successful in identifying </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">as it directly uses genomic DNA to produce the 16s rRNA gene sequence and compare it to the more then 60,000 bacterial type strains in the database [7]. This analysis has shown that </span><i>E. anophelis </i>accounts for far more infections than <i>E. meningoseptica</i>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4455 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-55-e1674368146144.png\" width=\"357\"/></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Elizabethkingia anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> culture taken from a patient and grown on 5% sheep blood agar</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Treatment</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Treatment regimens for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infections have not yet been established because the range of antibiotic resistance of the bacterium has not been completely characterized. However, studies have shown that minocycline and levofloxacin are the most effective in treatment. Minocycline belongs to the class of tetracycline antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and can be given orally. This medicine, however, cannot be given safely to children under the age of 8 [8]. Given that neonates are one of the most affected, other treatments are still being explored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Levofloxacin, on the other hand, is part of a new group of fluoroquinolones that inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes that are essential to bacterial DNA replication. Levofloxacin is usually not administered to children except in life-threatening infections such as one by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> [9]. Moxifloxacin, a drug in the same class of antibiotics, was successful in the treatment of the first human case of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infection. </span></p>\n<p><i><span>E. anophelis</span></i><span> has been classified as multi-drug resistant because it is not susceptible to common antibiotics such as \u03b2-lactams and \u03b2-lactam/lactamase inhibitors. Additionally, although many cases of </span><i><span>E. anophelis</span></i><span> have been misidentified as </span><i><span>E. meningoseptica</span></i><span>, they have distinct antimicrobial susceptibilities and require different treatments [10]. Many </span><i><span>E. anophelis </span></i><span>strains contain variants in the </span><i><span>catB </span></i><span>gene that confers antibiotic resistance to phenicol drugs and antibiotic inactivation enzymes [11].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The fatality of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> infection varies greatly across case reports, but in general has been estimated to be close to 30% [12].</span> Incorrect antimicrobial therapy regimens are a risk factor in the mortality of patients<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which means deciding on the correct antibiotics is essential to ensuring a patient\u2019s recovery and survival [13]. For example, antibiotics that are used to treat neonatal meningitis are ineffective against </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">infection, further highlighting the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment regimens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are currently being investigated as an alternative to antibiotic treatment, given the multi-drug resistant nature of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In Taiwan, a phage named TCUEAP1 was isolated from the wastewater of a hospital. While there is no bacteriophage specific to </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TCEUAP1 was able to infect three strains of the bacteria and reduce the number of colony-forming units (CFU). In a mouse model, the phage was able to decrease the bacterial load in their blood from 5\u00d710</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CFU/mL to 1\u00d710</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">5 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CFU/mL. In doing so, they were able to rescue 80% of the mice that would have otherwise died due to bacteremia [14]. Phages are a promising new therapy for treating multidrug resistant bacteria because they only attack their bacterial hosts and do so with a mechanism that is distinct from drugs.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Prevention and Future Research</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a nosocomial infection, the best prevention is good hygiene practices. Frequent hand washing by medical personnel as well as routine, thorough disinfection of surfaces may help in reducing the spread. Person-to-person transmission, either through direct or close contact with an infected individual, remains a possible infection mechanism that has yet to be confirmed by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in vitro </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">models. It has been proposed that mothers are able to vertically transmit the infection to their child during birth. The exact mechanism of how a person becomes infected by </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is unknown, but many research efforts are underway to describe its pathogenesis and route of transmission.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recent research has shown that the bacterium has</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">been able to evade the immune system\u2019s defenses. Macrophages are among the first cells of the immune system to respond to an infection. They have an antibacterial polarization state known as classically activated (M1) macrophages and are activated when a pathogen is detected. In this state, they change their morphology to engulf pathogens through phagocytosis to reduce the bacterial burden. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">evades this detection and prevents M1 macrophages from activating through a yet unknown mechanism. If activated M1 macrophages are present, the bacteria are also able to avoid being engulfed, which may be due to the bacterial capsule surrounding the bacterium. This type of phagocytosis evasion using a bacterial capsule has been observed by other bacteria such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Salmonella </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mycobacterium </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[15]. Considering that most patients who contracted an </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> infection were elderly, newborn, or immunocompromised, </span>this type of immune system evasion may be a contributing factor to the high mortality of the infection [5].</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4456 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-56.png\" width=\"416\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Image taken of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. anophelis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> using phase contrast microscopy.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4> As a computer science major, I have always been interested in the concept of an algorithm that can communicate with the brain through manufactured nerve signals. I read about this research in the news and I thought it was a great example of the marriage of biology and computer science, as well as how the two together can improve lives. I wrote this news article in hopes to reach more of the general public to shed light on the strides we\u2019re making in prosthetic technology.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New research was published early October 2019 in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Science Translational Medicine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with the first prosthesis augmented by sensory feedback for above-the-knee amputees.\u00b9 The findings have helped amputees achieve greater control over their prosthetic limbs. One participant in the clinical study reported feeling as if their prosthesis was their real leg again: \u201cAfter all of these years, I could feel my leg and foot again, as if it were my own leg,\u201d Djurica Resanovic said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to look at where your leg is to avoid falling.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Swiss companies ETH Zurich and SensArs Neuroprosthetics developed the sensory feedback technology to improve prosthetic devices. Seven sensors detect signals along the foot of the artificial leg prototype, and one sensor detects the angle of flexion from the knee. These communicate via Bluetooth to an electric conductor, called an electrode, surgically implanted into the stump\u2019s tibial nerve. Co-author of the publication and SensArs Neuroprosthetics co-founder Silvestro Micera has found the approach of piercing an electrode through the nerve rather than wrapping around it to be efficient in other studies performed for bionic hands. The sensors on the limb receive spatial information when moved, which are translated into biosignals by the team\u2019s new algorithm. The electrode implanted to the neuron receives the signals and sends the information through the nervous system to be received at the brain for processing. The better integration of the prosthesis to the body depends on the accuracy of these electrical signals, and how closely they resemble those a real leg would have produced.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Three amputees participated in a clinical trial over a period of three months to test the new technology. \u201cWe showed that less mental effort is needed to control the bionic leg because the amputee feels as though their prosthetic limb belongs to their own body,\u201d explained Stanisa Raspopovic, an ETH professor who led the study. \u201c\u2026the feedback is crucial for relieving the mental burden of wearing a prosthetic limb which, in turn, leads to improved performance and ease of use.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even blindfolded and wearing earplugs, participants were able to feel their prosthetic prototype. With the improved awareness of the limb in space, navigating through obstacles required less effort and as a result, subjects fell less. With no stimulation in the limb, the average ratio of falls to obstacles was 39 percent, as opposed to the ratio of eight percent with the stimulated prosthesis. On a test with stairs where subjects were tasked with completing laps, the average amount completed with the new technology was 2.28, as opposed to an average of 1.67 laps without it. Additionally, the brain appeared to be less burdened by the prosthesis, exhibiting lower amplitudes in acoustic event-related potentials tests.\u00b2 These tests pick up small voltages the brain gives off in response to stimuli, thus a lower reading would indicate less mental stimulation involved in maneuvering with the prosthesis.\u00b3 Consequently, more focus can be devoted towards other tasks within the amputee\u2019s life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Silvestro Micera believes the intraneural electrodes implemented in this research hold vast prospects in neuroprosthetic applications. \u201cWe believe [they] are key for delivering bio-compatible information to the nervous system\u2026 Translation to the market is just around the corner.\u201d\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne. \u201cAmputees merge with their bionic leg.\u201d ScienceDaily.

The class focused on the role and structure of septins, a group of proteins that are associated with several biological pathways, like autophagy. I chose to write about a set of experiments we did using yeast-two hybrid assays and fluorescence microscopy to understand the organization and interactions of septins.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4>: Autophagy is a degradation pathway in which autophagosomes, vesicular structures, deliver proteins and damaged organelles to the lysosomes for degradation. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that localize at the bud-neck and are involved in cytokinesis in budding yeast. Septins also localize at pre-autophagosomal structures and the autophagosome in the autophagy pathway. Previous data suggests that septins are involved in some pathways of autophagy, such as starvation-induced autophagy. It has been proposed that septins organize into distinct filaments and arrange into higher order structures at cell membranes, such as septin rings and foci. It is important to understand the structural and relational organization of septins, especially to determine their role in the autophagy pathway. Our results suggest that the structure and localization of septins changes after autophagy induction. We used a yeast-two hybrid assay to confirm the unique organization of septin subunits into rods and filaments. Fluorescence microscopy allowed us to visualize and observe the change in the localization and structure of those filaments from rings at the bud-neck to foci at the periphery following autophagy. This suggests septin filaments are dynamic.\nIntroduction: Septins, GTP-binding proteins, were first discovered in screens for cell cycle division mutants in budding yeast and are conserved from fungi to humans. Septins form hetero-oligomeric complexes that are assembled into a variety of higher-order structures, such as filaments and rings. These structures associate with cytoskeletal networks, like actin, or localize at plasma membranes to establish cell polarity and act as a cellular scaffold during cellular cycles such as cytokinesis, mitosis, apoptosis, and exocytosis. In yeast, four septin subunits form a Cdc11-Cdc12-Cdc3-Cdc10-Cdc10-Cdc3-Cdc12-Cdc11 octomeric rod that polymerize into filaments at distinct domains (1). Septins do not have any specific organization early in the cell cycle but arrange at the mother bud-neck of yeast into higher-order ring structures as the bud emerges. The septin rings remain at the site of division after cytokinesis and can thus be observed in the mother and daughter cells (2). Septins evidently play a role in the composition and distribution of membrane domains. Previous studies have suggested that septins regulate cytokinesis and bud site selection by recruiting proteins and bud-neck markers (3). The dynamics and higher-order structures of septins can be further observed in their role in autophagy. Autophagy is a degradation pathway in which autophagosomes, double membrane vesicular structures, deliver proteins and damaged organelles to the lysosomes for degradation. The autophagy pathway can be induced via nutrient deprivation. Barve et al observed that septins disassemble after nutrient deprivation and move to the cell periphery, forming unique dotted structures, or foci (4). By creating a Cdc11-GFP fusion and performing a simple yeast-two hybrid assay, we have constructed the arrangement of certain septin subunits and visualized the change in septin structures following autophagy.</p>\n<p><h4>Materials and Methods</h4> A yeast-two hybrid assay was designed using the methodology described in Camacho et al (5). Yeast cells grown to log phase were transformed with activation domain and binding domain vectors. The transformed cells were then plated in -Leu/-Ura media to grow only cells that received both plasmids. To determine whether the bait and prey interacted, the yeasts were streaked from the -Leu/-Ura plates onto -Leu/-Ura/-His and -Leu/-Ura/-Ade plates. The amount of growth for each transformation correlated with the strength of the interaction and was quantified using a system of pluses and minuses.\nThe following summarizes the combination of vectors used:<br/>\nPlasmid<br/>\n1. BD, Cdc11-AD<br/>\n2. Cdc11-BD, Cdc11-347-415-AD<br/>\n3. Cdc11-101-217-BD, Cdc11-AD<br/>\n4. Cdc12-BD, Cdc11\u0394347-415-AD<br/>\n5. Bem4-BD, Cdc11\u0394347-415-AD<br/>\n6. Bem4-BD, Cdc11-AD</p>\n<p>GFP tagged Cdc11 yeast cells were cultured in rich medium and in medium lacking nitrogen following the methodology of Barve et al to understand septin protein localization during starvation (4). A fluorescence microscope was used in combination with a digital CCD camera to record images at 40x and 100x for analysis. ImageJ software was used to quantify the number of septin rings and foci under the two conditions.</p>\n<p><h4>Results</h4>:\nOrganization and Protein Interactions of Septin Subunits<br/>\nOur yeast-two hybrid assay allowed us to determine interactions between select subunits in septins. We tested interactions between the septin subunits Cdc11 and Cdc12, and Cdc11 and itself. The interaction between Cdc11 and Bem4, a bud emergence protein, with and without the coiled coil domains, was also tested (Fig. 1A). The yeast-two hybrid assay showed a strong interaction between the septin subunits Cdc11 and Cdc12. This supports the rod model proposed by Bertin et al (Fig. 1B). It also shows an interaction between Cdc11 and itself, which is an expected interaction in septin filaments. We also observed some interactions that deviated from previous studies on septin organization. The deletion of the coiled-coil region of Cdc11 resulted in stronger interactions overall (Fig. 1A), which was unexpected. The slight interaction between Bem4, a protein involved in bud emergence, and Cdc11 lacking the coiled-coil domain is also an interaction that differs from models proposed in previous studies.</p>\n<p>Localization of Septins After Induction of Autophagy<br/>\nTo understand how septins localize after induction of autophagy, we observed Cdc11-GFP cells under a fluorescence microscope. Under nutrient rich growth conditions, we noted a prominent amount of distinct septin ring structures. In yeast that were grown under nutrient poor conditions, we observed dotted foci structures (Fig. 1C). Quantitation confirmed that starvation of cells yields a higher percentage of foci than septin ring structures (Fig. 1D). While it was difficult to tell whether the septin rings were forming at the bud neck as expected, the quantification and images of the yeast cells shows that there is a movement of septins to the cell periphery after starvation. The shift from septin ring structures to punctate foci structures is a clear indication that there is some rearrangement of septin units in addition to re-localization, proving that septin interactions are somehow regulated by autophagy.<br/>\nFigure:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1605\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"514\" sizes=\"(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px\" src=\"http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2018/04/coskun_figure.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2018/04/coskun_figure-230x121.png 230w, https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2018/04/coskun_figure-300x158.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2018/04/coskun_figure-350x184.png 350w, https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2018/04/coskun_figure-480x253.png 480w, https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2018/04/coskun_figure-768x404.png 768w, https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2018/04/coskun_figure-830x437.png 830w, https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2018/04/coskun_figure.png 976w\" width=\"976\"/><br/>\n<h4>Discussion</h4>: Although septins have been shown to be involved in important cell functions such as cytokinesis and autophagy, there are a limited number of studies that ascertain their protein-protein interactions and higher order organization. The model proposed by Bertin et al. establishes several interactions between the four septin subunits, but we constructed a partial model of septin rods and filaments by focusing on the Cdc11 and Cdc12 subunits as well as the Bem4 bud emergence protein in a yeast-two hybrid assay (Fig. 1A). This allowed us to establish that septins arrange into organized and dynamic structures. While the strong interaction between the septin subunits Cdc11 and Cdc12 were expected, we also observed some unexpected interactions. The deletion of the coiled-coil region of Cdc11 resulted in stronger interactions overall (Fig. 1A). This is surprising, considering that a previous study concluded that the coiled-coil domain is required for the proper function of Cdc (6). There was a slight interaction between Bem4, a protein involved in bud emergence, and Cdc11 lacking the coiled-coil domain. This is unexpected since a previous study demonstrated that the coiled-coil domain is required for the proper function of Cdc11 (6). While it has been reported that Cdc11 interacts with Bem4, it was determined that the coiled-coil domain plays no role in the interaction. The literature shows that the coiled-coil region is important for the interaction with the Cdc3 subunit and Bem4 (6). Our results suggest that the coiled-coil domain may inhibit Bem4 and Cdc11 interaction. Overall, our yeast-two hybrid assay indicated interactions that differ from the model proposed by Bertin et al.\nBy observing GTP fused Cdc11 protein, we imaged the localization of septins in nutrient rich and autophagy induced conditions. Our results show a significant increase in the number of foci compared to septin rings in autophagy induced conditions, suggesting that autophagy influences the localization of septins (Fig. 1D). The shift from septin rings to foci shows that septins are composed of dynamic protein units that can adjust structurally in reaction to autophagy. While our report does not establish a specific role for septins in autophagy, the localization of septins from the bud neck to the cell periphery after autophagy indicates that septins must play some role in the pathway. Future experiments can investigate other subunit interactions, such as Cdc12 with Cdc3 interactions, to further ascertain the octomeric and filamentous structure of septins. While there is a definite re-localization of septins after induction of autophagy, a Fluorescence Loss In Photobleaching (FLIP) experiment can further demonstrate septin dynamics by observing whether septins at the bud-neck migrate to the cell periphery after induction of autophagy. Observing the effect of septin mutations on autophagy, such as the assembly of pre-autophagosomal structures, would further establish how the localization of septins is related to their function in autophagy.</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bertin, Aur\u00e9lie, et al. \"Phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate promotes budding yeast septin filament assembly and organization.\" Journal of molecular biology 404.4 (2010): 711-731.</li>\n<li>Longtine, Mark S., and Erfei Bi. \"Regulation of septin organization and function in yeast.\" Trends in cell biology 13.8 (2003): 403-409.<br/>\nGladfelter, Amy S., et al. \"Interplay between septin organization, cell cycle and cell shape in yeast.\" J Cell Sci118.8 (2005): 1617-1628.<br/>\nBarve, Gaurav, et al. \"Septins are involved at the early stages of macroautophagy.\" bioRxiv (2016): 043133.</li>\n<li>Camacho, Lu\u00edsa, et al. \"Arabidopsis Rab-E GTPases exhibit a novel interaction with a plasma-membrane phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase.\" Journal of cell science 122.23 (2009): 4383-4392.</li>\n<li>Casamayor, Antonio, and Michael Snyder. \"Molecular dissection of a yeast septin: distinct domains are required for septin interaction, localization, and function.\" Molecular and cellular biology 23.8 (2003): 2762-2777.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div> </div>",

His allergies caused mild nosebleeds, which he would stop by pinching his nose for five minutes. This past year, however, the bleeding didn\u2019t stop.</p>\n<p>Five years ago, Jerry relocated to Iowa for work, as the company he worked for in California closed. For the past five years, everyday, Jerry has been taking two pills, one to alleviate his heart rate, blood pressure, and heart strain and another to lower his blood cholesterol. His doctor recommended that Jerry occasionally take low dose aspirin so his blood would flow more easily, he would feel less chest pain, and avoid blood clots and severe headaches. Although he hiked and went to the gym regularly, for a 5\u20195\u2019\u2019 56 year old man, he was slightly overweight at 165 lbs.</p>\n<p>A nosebleed, or epistaxis, can range from mild to severe, and sometimes lead to life-threatening consequences, depending on the flow (Fried 2013). The bleeding is due to rupture of small blood vessels inside the nose. Professor of head and neck surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Dr. Marvin Fried describes minor bleedings tend to occur \u201cmore frequently in children and adolescents\u201d and most are easily treatable, while more severe, rarer cases occur in patients over 50, with blood oozing down the back of the throat, and generally require emergency treatment. Epistaxis may result from mild conditions, including nose picking, mild allergies to pollen or environmental irritants, and moderate conditions such as trauma or prior nasal surgery. In some cases, epistaxis can occur due to life threatening conditions such as leukemia. Family history of severe or heavy bleeding tends toward more severe cases and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease tend to have severe nosebleeds. Dr. Fried emphasizes \u201cepistaxis can be either short-term and disappear quickly or it can also occur in sudden episodes\u201d. In some instances, epistaxis occurs with other symptoms, such as fever, headache, and dizziness.<span id=\"more-483\"></span></p>\n<p>Diagnosing epistaxis involves understanding the patient\u2019s medical history and a physical examination, especially of the nose, to help determining possible underlying diseases. Because epistaxis may be short lasting, a diagnosis and its cause can be missed so a clinical examination can be recommended. Understanding if a patient uses aspirin is critical to diagnosis, as low-dose aspirin lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease, it also increases the risk of epistaxis, making the bleeding last longer and harder to stop (Kasperek and Pollock 2013). Pinching the nose for five minutes while sitting upright can normally control the bleeding.</p>\n<p>Last Spring when his nose bled, Jerry pinched his nose to stop the bleeding, but it only \u00a0stopped temporarily. However, unusually, he experienced another nose bleed the same day, and inconveniently, during the week, he continued to have nose bleeds not only at home, but also at his office, while driving, and at dinner with friends. Each time he repeatedly pinched his nose stopping the nose bleed.</p>\n<p>At the end of that week, Jerry and his friend were planning to go hiking, but even before beginning the hike, his nose started to bleed. This time, he felt blood rushing down into his stomach and thought blood vessels \u201cwere damaged deep inside his nose\u201d. Concerned, Jerry and his friend rushed to the emergency room.</p>\n<p>The physician assistant (PA) questioned Jerry regarding his aspirin usage, and reviewed his medical history, learning he had no prior bleeding disorders, took aspirin occasionally, and had prior treatment for nosebleeds as a child. After the physical examination, the PA dried his nostrils and stopped the nosebleed by inserting a stick coated with silver nitrate against the source for less than five seconds burning the nose tissues. Afterwards Jerry and his friend left the hospital and stopped at a Thai restaurant for dinner. After the first few bites, his nose bled all over the table including his spicy eggplant dish. Shaken and extremely worried, Jerry went back to the hospital, where another PA reviewed his prior treatment and medical history and examined his nose. Then, the PA inserted a balloon into his nose and pumped air to expand the balloon, applying direct pressure to the nostrils, to decrease and stop what Jerry recalled as \u201cnonstop bleeding\u201d. The PA warned him to stop aspirin usage and not eat spicy food, otherwise the bleeding would continue. Jerry rested for a week and the PA referred him to see a nose specialist in three days.</p>\n<p>In more severe cases of epistaxis, if the bleeding doesn\u2019t stop, the site next to the bleeding vessel can be burned, cauterized, with \u201csilver nitrate on an applicator stick\u201d (Fried 2013). Cauterization has a success rate of more than 80% of blood stoppage. Although complications with this procedure are uncommon, many patients report nerve damage and breathing obstruction post treatment. In many cases, breathing obstruction can be surgically fixed by straightening the nasal septum, which divides the left and right airways in the nose, also known as septoplasty. In the few cases in which cauterization fails, a balloon or pack is used to absorb the blood. If the patient doesn\u2019t experience re-bleeding in the following appointment, the pack should be removed. However, in many cases, nasal packing is not the first choice of treatment, as it not only leads to physical discomfort, but often emergency surgery.</p>\n<p>At his appointment, the specialist slowly pulled the balloon out of his nose. \u00a0To the doctor\u2019s surprise, immediately, blood started to flow out. The doctor told Jerry to pinch his nose and go to the hospital where the doctor would surgically close off the artery to stop the bleeding. Post-surgery, Jerry stayed overnight in the hospital and rested at home for a couple of weeks. The doctor recommended Jerry not to consume spicy foods, or take aspirin for a few weeks; however, he could continue to use his other medications. The doctor prescribed painkillers to use when needed to suppress the heavy pain he felt from the surgery and balloon. Over the next three days, the blood diluted and oozed into a gauze inside his nose. \u00a0Every three hours, during those three days, Jerry replaced the gauze until the bleeding stopped.</p>\n<p>Two weeks after surgery, Jerry told the doctor he wasn\u2019t able to breathe easily. After an examination, his doctor confirmed the breathing obstruction that resulted from the tissue damage accumulated during cauterization. The doctor then surgically repaired the damaged cartilage through septoplasty. To prevent future nosebleeds, the doctor recommended using a nasal spray to keep the nose moist until it improves.</p>\n<p>In the rare case that epistaxis cannot be controlled after cauterization and nasal packing, a surgical method to constrict the blood vessels, ligation, is done to control the bleeding (Flint et. al. 2010). In this procedure, the surgeon clips the artery responsible for the epistaxis using endoscopic guidance. With success rates of 93%, this procedure is not associated with any serious complications except continued epistaxis after the surgery due to the failure to clip all the arterial branches.</p>\n<p>This traumatizing event led Jerry to make lifestyle changes to avoid taking aspirin. Following surgery, he educated himself on the causes of blood clots and the precautionary measures he can take to avoid one. He began incorporating simple changes, including avoiding salt on his food, fat content milk, and high fructose foods. Over the months, Jerry reduced his calorie intake and exercised two hours a day. After five months, his weight dropped from 165 lbs. to 132 lbs. and at his next appointment, his cardiologist was amazed as all his numbers drastically improved for good/bad cholesterol and triglycerides(fat). Since this event, Jerry has had no nose bleeds and inspired his family to make healthier decisions.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Flint P, Haughey B, Lund V, et. al. 2010.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>LASIK, or laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, is a surgical procedure commonly used to correct for visual defects or lack of visual clarity. Commonly referred to as laser eye surgery, LASIK is a type of surgery that is used to alleviate visual loss associated with common defects of the eye, such as myopia (nearsightedness), hypermetropia (farsightedness), and astigmatism. Astigmatism, like near and far-sightedness, can be caused by the irregularity in shape of the cornea that leads to blurred vision. For all three cases, corneal remodeling via LASIK can be performed (Thomson, 2015).</p>\n<p>The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye, the transparent part that one can touch, and upon which contact lenses are placed. It is responsible for most of the focusing power, and thus is a common culprit in visual defects of the eye. The cornea focuses the light reflected into the eye, through the lens and onto the the retina at the back of the eye, which senses light and converts it to nerve impulses, and transmits the resulting image to the brain for processing. This then produces the image that we \u2018see\u2019. While the retina is the part of the eye that is light-sensitive and is responsible for transmitting the image to the brain, the cornea, along with the lens, must focus light reflecting off of three dimensional surfaces so that they strike onto the anterior, or front part of the retina. Without this precise focusing of light rays directly onto the retina, the brain generates a blurred image (NKCF 2014).</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-488\"></span></p>\n<p><a data-caption=\"\" href=\"http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2015/04/eyediagram.jpg\"><img alt=\"Cornea Consultants of Texas\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-491\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"247\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" src=\"http://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2015/04/eyediagram.jpg\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2015/04/eyediagram-300x190.jpg 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2015/04/eyediagram.jpg 390w\" width=\"390\"/></a></p>\n<p>Image courtesy of CCT</p>\n<p><h4></h4>The shape of the cornea is of vital importance to the eye\u2019s ability to bend incoming light rays in a manner that will focus the rays onto the retina. While the shape of the lens behind the cornea can be adjusted to assist with focusing, the cornea has a fixed shape. Therefore, anomalies in its shape can cause loss of visual acuity, or sharpness. For instance, a cornea that is too thick can cause the light rays to focus on a point in front of the retina, which leads to blurred vision, especially with objects far from the eye. This is common in the case of nearsightedness. The cornea can also be, among other things, too flat, causing the light rays to focus behind the retina. This leads to blurred vision from objects at a distance, a symptom of farsightedness. While near and far-sightedness can be caused by other more complex irregularities in the eye, visual defects associated with the abnormal shape of the cornea can be corrected for with external lenses, as in glasses or contacts. Another option is to permanently alter the shape of the cornea to allow light to focus properly onto the retina and produce a clear image (NEI).</p>\n<p>While LASIK isn\u2019t the only surgical procedure to adjust the shape of the cornea, it is the most popular. In fact, it is the most common elective, or non-emergency, surgery in North America (TLC 2015). Although the idea of having an ultraviolet laser beam pointed directly, and intentionally, into one\u2019s eye while conscious and lucid can be a scary prospect, LASIK is considered to be very safe and highly effective. The procedure can be done in less than thirty minutes for both eyes and is performed in an outpatient, or non-hospital, setting (Wachler 2015). The procedure itself is relatively simple as far as surgeries go. It begins with anesthetic eye drops that numb the surface of the eye. Once moistened, a suction ring is applied to keep the eye stationary. The ophthalmologist, a surgeon specialized in treating conditions of the eye, can then \u2018make the cut\u2019 (FTC 2012).</p>\n<p>The cornea, while transparent, actually consists of several layers of tissue. In order to remold the cornea, the ophthalmologist must first get past the tough outer layer of the eye. Since the cornea is the part of the eye that is exposed to the outside world, it must have a protective function to prevent damage to, or infection of, the eye (Garrity 2013). To access the inner layer of the cornea that can be reshaped for vision correction, the surgeon first creates a flap in the outer layers of the cornea. This is done by either a microkeratome, small, special blade designed to cut corneal flaps, or a high-energy laser. The cut is made so that a part of the outer layer of cornea is intact, creating a sort of hinge, which allows the ophthalmologist to lift the flap of cornea and access the inner layers. A laser is then used to remove a microscopic amount of tissue in order to properly shape the cornea. The flap is then placed back down, and a shield, typically of a clear plastic, is temporarily placed over the eye to keep the flap in place. No stitches are used and the cornea essentially heals on its own (FTC 2012).</p>\n<p>Of course, no surgery is without complications, and LASIK is no exception. While it is heralded as extremely safe, the procedure is irreversible and can, in rare cases, lead to a permanently damaged cornea due to improper healing or infection post-operation. As one might perhaps expect, blindness or other vision loss may occur as well. While most people achieve 20/20 vision (sometimes erroneously referred to as \u2018perfect vision\u2019), some detailed vision may be mildly impaired. Patients do not gain superhuman vision, and will likely need reading glasses in their forties. More than ten percent will have their improved vision deteriorate to the point of requiring retreatment (FTC 2012). However, considering its very high success rate and low risk of complications, LASIK remains a safe and viable treatment for nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism, and has been FDA approved since 1998 (ES).</p>\n<p>Works Cited</p>\n<p>Thompson, V.

Bhutan is a small, Himalayan country located near India and Nepal.The spread of rice cultivation in Bhutan is an illustration the effect of global climate change. Rice typically grows in low lying, relatively warm areas with high precipitation certain times of the year. The vast majority of the country\u2019s land area is above 6000 feet, which is considered too high of an elevation for rice cultivation under normal circumstances. <span id=\"more-470\"></span>\u00a0For much of the country\u2019s history a single type of rice has been grown in the Paro Valley of Bhutan, where while it is warm and humid much of the year. However, this is changing. While interviewing a farmer in the Jakar province, which is at roughly 8000 feet in elevation, he mentioned that it is getting warmer and he might be able to grow rice soon. Normally, the growing season in that area is much too short for rice but as the temperature warms, it could soon be possible. However, the type of rice the farmer was speaking of was not the native cultivar, but an imported variety from India that is used as a cash crop. India on average is much warmer than Bhutan, so the idea that a non-native variety of rice is being grown in an area where previously the climate was inappropriate for the native variety illustrates climate change. When my research group asked the farmer if he was worried about this climate change, he said yes, but also said the extra revenue from the rice would make his income much more dependable. This small incident with the rice hopefully illustrates some of the complex effects of climate change and how there are social issues that must be considered as well.</p>\n</div>",

        "title": "Can Polio Cure Cancer?",
        "author": "Briga Mullin, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, \u201915",
        "date": "04/11/2015",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>The human body\u2019s immune system has been developed to successfully battle foreign invaders including bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Immunotherapy is the idea that the power of the immune system can be utilized against diseases such as cancer. Typically, the immune system does not harm the body\u2019s own cells, preventing it from being extremely effective against cancer. However with different medical interventions to strengthen the body\u2019s immune response, it is possible to get an effective treatment (Cancer Immunotherapy 2015).</p>\n<p>A unique and exciting branch of immunotherapy involves oncolytic viruses, genetically modified viruses that are used to infect tumor cells and fight cancer (Vile, Ando, and Kirn 2002). One example of an oncolytic virus is Oncolytic Polio/Rhinovirus Recombinant (PVS-RIPO), a genetic combination of poliovirus and a strain of the common cold. <span id=\"more-475\"></span>Currently the PVS-RIPO virus is being tested in clinical trials at Duke University against recurrent glioblastoma brain tumors (Pelley 2015). Glioblastoma tumors are extremely fast growing, malignant, and often are difficult to eradicate with traditional therapies (Pelley 2015). It is hoped that early success using PVS-RIPO against glioblastoma is indicative of future success against this cancer as well as many others (Pelley 2015).</p>\n<p>While polio is only one of several types of viral therapies being pursued, it is promising for several reasons. Important factors to consider in a virotherapy drug are how to prevent the virus from affecting healthy cells, and how to ensure the virus successfully invades and replicates in cancer cells (Vile, R., Ando, D., Kirn, D. 2002). The genetically modified polio virus is highly effective because it meets both of these criteria (Desjardins et. al., 2014). PVS-RIPO recognizes a tumor antigen, a signal molecule expressed on the surface of most malignant tumor cells, allowing the virus to bind and enter into tumor cells. This receptor is not on healthy cells, preventing healthy cells from being infected by the virus. When cells are attacked by either cancer or a virus, normal defensive mechanisms are disabled allowing the cancer or virus to proliferate. Without these mechanisms cells cannot recognize the abnormalities and instigating pathways of apoptosis, programmed cell death, that would normally occur (Vile, R., Ando, D., Kirn, D. 2002). PVS-RIPO virus is a debilitated form of polio, engineered to grow successfully only in cells where cancer has already disabled normal cell defense mechanisms. Because its ability to stop cell defense mechanisms has been removed, the modified form of polio in PVSRIPO is unable to survive independently in non-cancerous cells (Desjardins et. al., 2014).</p>\n<p>While viral infection of the tumor cells is key to the success of this treatment, it is not actually the PVS-RIPO virus that kills the cells. Researchers hypothesize the real mechanism of \u00a0treatment is that the immune system recognizes the polio viral infection and attacks the body\u2019s own cancer cells in an effort to remove the foreign virus inside the tumor. Once the body\u2019s immune system is reprogrammed to recognize the tumor cells as foreign, it destroys them and effectively removes the cancer (Targeting Cancer\u20262015).</p>\n<p>This theory is producing results in the clinical trials of PVS-RIPO at Duke University. The stage 1 clinical trial has so far included 22 patients, and while 11 have died, 11 have had successful reduction of their tumor and currently 3 are cancer free (Pelley 2015). The level of success in this stage 1 trial is very promising, especially because the treatment involves nothing more than an injection of PVS-RIPO directly into the tumor. This is obviously preferable to cycles of chemotherapy and radiation which come with serious negative side effects (Pelley 2015). There are some side effects to the viral treatment in cases when the tumor swells in response to the attack by immune system. Patients currently in the study demonstrate slow shrinkage of their tumor over time as the immune system destroys the cancer (Desjardins et. al., 2014).</p>\n<p>Because of these results, this particular virotherapy is currently receiving huge attention and is being considered by the FDA for \u201cbreakthrough\u201d status which would allow much more rapid and accessible spread of the treatment (Pelley 2015). Hopefully these attentions will facilitate further research into virotherapy for more than just glioblastoma treatment. For example, a similar approach being studied is the use of a modified herpes virus to treat late stage melanoma (Keller 2014). The mechanism for this virotherapy involves the herpes virus invading and lysing tumor cells, as well as stimulating immune cells to attack circulating tumor cells throughout the body (Keller 2014). More research is needed both in the polio and herpes virotherapy techniques, but hopefully the future will hold many more cancer treatments like them, where the advances of molecular biology and biochemistry create cancer treatments that kill tumors without the damage and side effects of chemotherapy and radiation.</p>\n<p>Works Cited</p>\n<p>Cancer Immunotherapy: Cancer Vaccines. 2014.

        "date": "01/26/2015",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>SV2A is a synaptic vesicle protein, which participates in the regulation of neurotransmitter release in humans. SV2A is expressed in neurons and endocrine cells. The exact function of SV2A is still unknown, but it has been identified that SV2A is the binding site for the antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam. Levetiracetam reduces presynaptic glutamate release, especially in neurons with high frequency firing. Abnormally enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission with high frequency neural firing is found in epilepsy and several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Huntington\u2019s disease.<span id=\"more-393\"></span></p>\n<p>In hopes to discover more about the role of SV2A in neurogenetic disorders, human SV2A was studied in yeast cells. In the study, many copies Human SV2A was made using PCR amplification.The SV2A gene was then ligated in-frame into a yeast centromeric expression vector. Standard yeast media was used in the initial growth experiments. After the yeast colonies grew and colonies containing SV2A were identified, the cells were transferred to different media containing different carbon sources. These yeast cells were deficient in 6-carbon sugar transport, which means they lack proteins required for 6-carbon sugar uptake, and these yeast colonies will die on media containing 6-carbon sugars as a nutrient source. \u00a0However, yeast colonies containing SV2A were able to grow on media that contained galactose, but not media containing other 6-carbon sugar sources, which proves SV2A is a galactose transporter, which means that galactose transport capability of SV2A may play an important role in regulating synaptic function.</p>\n<p>To study the effects of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam on galactose uptake, this drug was added to media that contained galactose. Yeast cells containing SV2A were then transferred to this media from the standard growth media. These yeast cells did not grow, which indicates that levetiracetam inhibits the galactose-dependent growth of hexose transport-deficient yeast cells expressing SV2A. This shows that levetiracetam inhibits galactose uptake and transport by SV2A. These results further support the findings that SV2A is a galactose transporter, and that galactose has an important role in neuronal physiology.</p>\n<p>To see if SV2A-mediated galactose uptake was coupled to proton transport, CCCP, which is a protonophore (a proton translocator, which allows protons to cross lipid bilayers, which does not normally occur without presence of a transport protein) was added to a fixed time assay. CCCP completely blocked the transport of galactose by SV2A. This indicates that SV2A is a proton-coupled symporter, which means that SV2A, as a transporter, has dual functions in neurons. These experiments have shown that SV2A is a galactose transporter, but further studies still need to be done to determine the exact function of SV2A in neurons and endocrine cells.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><h4></h4></p>\n<p>Madeo, Marianna, Attila D.

When I heard about a single bacteria cell reaching 2 centimeters, I almost couldn\u2019t believe it. This article was originally written for my upper division writing course, to translate specialized knowledge for those who do not have the same experience with a topic that we might. I wrote about T. magnifica because I genuinely believe it to be a deeply interesting and amazing discovery, and I want to convey what makes this new species so interesting to people who don\u2019t have a deep understanding of microbiology. I just had to know how it could grow that big. And now that I\u2019ve learned more about it, I want to teach others that to reach this size, the cell has to break a lot of preconceptions we have about cellular limitations.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are some of the largest living things you can think of? An elephant? A blue whale? What about the giant sequoias or towering redwoods? There are a lot of \u201cbiggest\u201d organisms in the world, but would you ever expect a bacterium to claim that title? Just recently, a new king of giant bacteria was crowned.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Candidatus Thiomargarita magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a bacteria whose cells can stretch up to an impressive two centimeters in length, was just discovered this February through joint research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and France\u2019s Mus\u00e9um National d\u2019Histoire Naturelle [1].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cOnly two centimeters? That\u2019s as big as a penny!\u201d You may think to yourself. And you\u2019d be right, but this defies all expectations about how big bacteria can grow. Take a more common bacteria like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, for example. They are the \u201cgold standard\u201d for many scientists, especially for bacterial size and morphology. A single cell averages only one micrometer in length (one thousand micrometers fit in a millimeter). By comparison, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> looks massive, reaching sizes over 20,000 times larger with just a single cell. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> were as big as the average person, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> would tower over us at 100,000 feet (19 miles) tall</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which is high enough to reach supersonic plane altitudes in the stratosphere. But if most bacteria are microscopic, what advantage is there to growing so massive?</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4438\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-300x210.png\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Relative to a human-sized </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> cell, a single </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thiomargarita magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> cell would be over twice as tall as Mount Everest.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Their massive size is a survival strategy for life in the outside environment. Bacteria like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E. coli</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Salmonella, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">are small because they are pathogens. When you mostly live inside another organism, staying small means you can reproduce faster, spread easier, avoid capture, and gather all the rich nutrients in your host. Yet outside our bodies live entire microbial ecosystems with members that have to depend on themselves rather than a gracious host for everything, like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thiomargarita</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> genus, who despite the name have nothing to do with margaritas, are part of a larger group called \u201csulfur bacteria\u201d that \u201ceat\u201d sulfur to get their energy. These bacteria like to live in the mud of streams, ponds, and estuaries where sulfur levels are high and oxygen levels are just right for survival. Unlike other more active bacteria, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thiomargarita </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">do not move around very much. Once they stick somewhere, they live their entire lives on that spot. By growing bigger, they can better handle any potential changes that affect the concentrations of their energy source without needing to relocate from a good spot [2]. This is a sound strategy used by many members of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thiomargarita</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, including the former size champion </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thiomargarita namibiensis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> which only grows to 750 micrometers in diameter.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But what does </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> do differently to grow so big? Think of a simple bacterial cell like a balloon filled with water, glitter, and a piece of string. The rubber of the balloon is the membrane, the water is the cytoplasm that fills the cell, the glitter floating around inside is the different materials the cell needs to stay alive, and the string is the DNA, the blueprint of the cell. For our balloon cell to stay alive, it needs to move its parts around fast enough to fix damage, take in food, and excrete waste. When the balloon is small those parts can move around easily enough on their own; just by random chance, the pieces of glitter will get where they need to be, and our stringy DNA is more than enough to call all the shots.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the balloon gets bigger, it takes longer for everything to cross the distance, and the DNA can\u2019t make it to where it is needed. The surface area of our balloon has increased, but the volume inside grows even faster. This is the major problem with diffusion, which many bacteria rely on for their survival [3]. At microscopic sizes it takes less than a second for a molecule to diffuse its way through the cytoplasm. However, it takes oxygen over an hour to diffuse across even a millimeter [4]. And larger, heavier molecules, like life-sustaining sugars, move even slower. Growing too big means there\u2019s too much space to cover, and diffusion alone cannot meet the bacterial cell\u2019s needs to survive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But diffusion is all that bacteria really have. Bacteria belong to a group called the prokaryotes, whose cells appear relatively simple when compared to our own. The very definition of a prokaryote is a lack of membrane-bound organelles (tiny organs within the cell). This is why most bacteria stick to such small sizes; they physically can\u2019t afford to grow too big without starving themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yet, some bacteria, like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, are determined to prove both physics and biology wrong. Along with other members of the genus, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> fills most of its body with a large vacuole in order to effectively decrease the volume that needs diffusion. It\u2019s like filling the water balloon with another large balloon, so that everything is pressed into the thin layer between. The cytoplasm is actually only around 3 micrometers thick the whole way around the cell, with the vacuole taking up 73% of its total volume [1]. So even though the cell may be very large, a lot of the important processes take place in the very periphery of the outer membrane in that very thin layer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That thin layer may hold all the cellular machinery, but it wouldn\u2019t make sense to waste all that extra space, either. So the vacuole also doubles as a storehouse for the various chemicals that the bacteria might need to keep away from their proteins or are simply harder to come across. Important compounds like nitrates can be stored inside and kept at concentrations much higher than the surrounding environment whilst protecting other parts of the cell from harmful side reactions [2]. Recent investigations even indicate that they could use this extra membrane as a way to produce energy, much like how our own cells use mitochondrial membranes to produce most of our energy. This multipurpose structure is one of the reasons why </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has been able to reach such staggering lengths. It also proves that bacteria are more than the simple balloons of chemicals that we might make them out to be.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another difficulty with large cell size relates to the cell\u2019s DNA. With smaller cells, it\u2019s easy enough to read off of a single copy for every protein it needs. But in a bigger cell, even with a thin cytoplasm, proteins would take too long to reach their destinations. And this is where </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> really stands out from the rest. Where most bacteria have one copy of their DNA, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has many, a situation known as polyploidy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Polyploidy itself is hardly new. Even we have two copies of each of our 23 chromosomes, and some plants can have dozens of them. The other </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thiomargaritas</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> also have multiple copies of their chromosome spread around the cell, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> stands out for having over 737,000 copies in a fully grown cell [1]. With one of the highest known numbers of DNA copies, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> can spread them throughout the body and maintain its impressive size.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having the most DNA copies is not enough, however. One more unusual trait about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">T. magnifica </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is how it stores its DNA. Bacteria usually let their chromosome float around in the cytoplasm, accessed whenever it\u2019s needed. But this giant actually keeps its DNA stored within specialized compartments that its discoverers have adorably named a \u201cPepin\u201d in analogy with the pips (small seeds) in a watermelon [1].

I chose to write about this topic because I am very interested in conservation biology and work as an undergraduate researcher in this field. I had heard of environmental DNA before at my lab, but wanted to learn more by doing my own research. From this piece, I hope readers learn about the new and exciting ways species monitoring is being done to preserve ecosystems.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marine species are experiencing higher population declines than many terrestrial species due to anthropogenic causes [1], such as increased water exports or runoff impacting habitats and behavioral patterns. Aquatic systems require a greater focus on species preservation, but keeping track of different species can be difficult. A first step in conservation involves genetic monitoring to track population decline. Genetic monitoring uses DNA to study variation within a species, as well as to discriminate between different species types in an environment. Monitoring a species may include the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) in lieu of DNA collected off of the organism itself. eDNA is a sample collected from a habitat, such as water from a stream, that contains the DNA of the species present. The skin, mucus, or hair of an organism when shed contains DNA that can be eluted and amplified to detect species [2]. Samples are then used for metabarcoding, or non-species specific detection, as well as for targeting a certain species of interest through assay development of different genetic markers [2]. Overall, this method of sample collection is both non-invasive and applicable for smaller populations when capture methods tend to lose reliability [1]. Traditional capture methods are not always successful in areas where a species may currently or recently inhabit, which is where eDNA can be used to discover new territories and monitor current ones.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Studies have been conducted with environmental samples to monitor endangered species, as well as non-native species that endanger other populations [1, 3]. eDNA detections often need validation through replicates or prior knowledge of inhabitants, as using eDNA is still a relatively new form of sample collection. Schmelzle et al. (2016) highlights how current eDNA research centers on standardizing DNA capture methods to ensure repeatability [4]. Therefore, studies are being conducted to compare eDNA to traditional capture methods to determine if positive detections can be made the same as if a tissue sample was taken from an organism.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, there is concern over whether eDNA can be reliably used for instances where seasonality impacts species presence in an area [5], as well as instances where DNA may degrade before proper evaluation [6]. In order to understand how eDNA can be utilized to find the limitations of aquatic species detection, various studies have been compiled. In this review, we evaluate the current methodology, validity, effectiveness, and concerns of eDNA through studies centered on endangered or invasive aquatic species.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Methodology</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While collection, extraction and analysis methods and materials are not always the same, the general process of going from an environmental sample to an identifiable DNA sequence of a species is. First, the water collected for any aquatic system sampling must be filtered. There are several methods to do this that involve different materials and containers to collect and filter water. Ratcliffe et al. (2020), for example, took water samples from the Irish and Celtic seas to detect key taxa in the area. The researchers strained the water using a syringe and filters, where the water was stored in the filter holder containers at -20\u00b0C until DNA extraction [7]. Alternatively, Boothroyd et al. (2016) filtered their water samples with a funnel and vacuum right before DNA extraction to prevent degradation. These samples are generally stored with ethanol at -20\u00b0C before DNA extraction and -80\u00b0C afterwards [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Franklin et al. (2018) and Dubreuil et al. (2021) used the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit in a two day extraction process of lysis for DNA release, and subsequent washing/elution to isolate the DNA. Afterwards, qPCRs in each study were run against an assay containing the genetic marker for identification of a specific species of interest, or in some cases a range of taxa. Species and their relative abundances have the potential to be identified via DNA sequencing starting with an environmental sample.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Researchers take different approaches in validating positive detections, such as through the use of controls and assessment of assays. For example, Mauvisseau et al. (2019) detected pearl mussels in Lake Windermere. The researchers validated their assays targeting the COI and 16S genes, regions optimal for species identification, with statistical analysis on their level of detection and quantification before using them against the samples collected in the study. The eDNA detections were also tested against tissue samples and positive controls to ensure accuracy. This was a double-blind experiment during the water sample collection and filtering process, where sample site information was not revealed to the researchers until after analysis was done [2]. Dubreuil et al. (2021) cited Mauvisseau et al. (2019) as the researchers followed the same statistical guidelines, and their assays proved to be specific to only their species of interest via the positive detections observed. Lastly, Franklin et al. (2018) also took steps to evaluate an appropriate assay for their species. They found that the COI genetic marker also distinguished their species of interest, smallmouth bass, from other non-target species. They examined COI sequences of bass from different regions to obtain sequence specific primers. The developed assay was tested against database sequences, tissue samples, and finally eDNA itself [9]. These preliminary tests aid in ensuring accurate detections are being made when the assay is used against eDNA samples.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, repeatability in sample analysis can be used to rule out contamination and strengthen confidence in positive detections. Schmelzle et al. (2016) demonstrated this by testing each water sample with 6 replicate qPCRs alongside positive controls to detect tidewater gobies on the California coast. qPCRs are done to identify and quantify the DNA in the samples collected, while positive controls confirm the accuracy of target detections. Overall, research tends to center on validating eDNA detections, as variability can be high even within the same sampling region.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4449 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2023/01/unnamed-54.png\" width=\"512\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Genetic information from numerous species may be present in one water sample. Researchers may choose to target a specific species or to identify all of the species in the sample using DNA sequencing methods. </span><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/aps-19-1-6.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">National Park Service</span></a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Comparison to traditional methods</h4></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A non-invasive method\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A benefit of eDNA sample collection is that it is noninvasive to an ecosystem. This is most beneficial for detecting low density species when capture methods tend to fail. Boothroyd et al. (2016) evaluated the effectiveness of eDNA in relation to traditional capture methods, specifically regarding spotted gar fish that were collected via netting. The downsides of netting include sample size limitations and disruption of habitats. Boothroyd et al. (2016) placed fyke nets (cylindrical fish traps) at the eDNA sample sites for 24 hours during the spotted gar spawning season to gather a representative sample. Fin clips from 12 reference samples of spotted gar captured were used for DNA extraction and downstream analysis to compare to the eDNA samples [1]. eDNA detections, made from 1 liter water samples, were consistent with areas spotted gar were previously known to inhabit, and were even made at sites where capture methods failed to pick up the species of interest when placed [1]. The researchers in this study also captured dozens of other fish species at the different bodies of water sampled while attempting to collect spotted gar. The variability of netting shows that it can cause disruption for more than just the species of interest, as well as limit the sample size.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similarly, Schmelzle et al. (2016) used occupancy modeling to compare traditional capture methods against eDNA detection. This study noted the limitations of traditional capture methods in their low capture yield versus high cost and time requirement. A seine haul (vertical net placed in the water) of tidewater goby fish was taken at each sample location to compare to the water samples collected. It was found that eDNA detections from the water samples, validated against known goby presence and replicate qPCRs, were more effective than seining detections in accurately representing goby occupancy [4]. Schmelzle et al. (2016) concluded that eDNA has the potential to be the dominant method for tidewater goby tracking [4]. In another study, Dubreuil et al. (2021) set up baited fish traps for armored catfish at sample sites three times each for 16 hours. eDNA of the species of interest was detected in the water sampled at 18 sites. Alternatively, the fish traps detected catfish at 14 of the 18 sites where positive eDNA detections were made [8]. There were no captures made at sites eDNA did not detect. This study highlights that trapping is variable, as it can depend upon predation, breeding, and food sources [8]. eDNA may be subject to similar variability, however, due to its sensitivity even a species low in numbers can be detected. While trapping non-native species is not as large of a concern in terms of invasiveness, the possibility of capturing at risk species in the area can be avoided with eDNA.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Reaching new limits with low density species detection\u00a0</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eDNA has proven to detect species in a wide range of sampling locations, even where inhabitantance has not previously been verified with traditional capture methods [1, 4]. This is in part because traditional capture methods become all the more difficult as a species population size declines. de Souza et al. (2016) monitored the black warrior waterdog salamander and flattened musk turtle, two at risk species from the upper Black Warrior River basin of Alabama that are impacted by habitat degradation, using eDNA sampling. The low payoff of laborious methods such as dip netting, trapping, and electrofishing for these species makes eDNA a better alternative. The researchers highlighted how sampling with eDNA is most effective when used alongside knowledge of a species\u2019s territorial range and migration patterns, which is also true for trapping/fishing except that the latter takes more time to gather the necessary sample size [5]. eDNA also has the sensitivity to detect low density species, colonization events, and target species against similar ones [1, 3, 4, 9]. For instance, Mauvisseau et al. (2019) found that eDNA was able to differentiate between freshwater pearl mussels and non-target species with two different assays used against other mussel species. Meanwhile, Franklin et al. (2018) had success in identifying smallmouth bass, even when simulations predicted the genetic marker of choice would amplify additional species from the eDNA sample. eDNA allows researchers to determine the presence of a species with low population numbers in order to increase the regions being targeted for conservation.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Detecting non-native species</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Non-native species are found either at a low density due to recent colonization, or a high density due to successful adaptation. Both instances need to be monitored to assess plans of action for restoring ecosystem balance [8]. In a notable study, Franklin et al. (2018) detected smallmouth bass to maintain the population of pacific salmon and other native species of the Pacific Northwest. While the spread of smallmouth bass in the US has had economic benefits, close population management is required for habitat stability [9]. Smallmouth bass have been documented to consume 35% of a salmon run, which has negative consequences on salmon migration and local predator/prey interactions. eDNA, with its high sensitivity, was able to detect smallmouth bass successfully against non-target species to find sample locations that require conservation targeting [9]. Similarly, Dubreuil et al. (2021) also tested eDNA by tracking armored catfish who recently started to inhabit rivers in Martinique and compete with gobies for food sources. 22% of sample sites detected the aquatic invasive species (AIS), armored catfish, using water collections. This AIS did not appear to have habitat preferences, such as pH, oxygen level, or temperature. Therefore, this species is more likely to successfully adapt to new territories [8], hence the need for species monitoring.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Current limitations</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the promise that eDNA shows, there are potential concerns over its consistency and longevity. For example, de Souza et al. (2016) evaluated the effect of species\u2019 seasonality on eDNA detection probabilities. Seasonality differences may limit the time frame eDNA can effectively be utilized for and introduce a sampling bias. The study discovered that warm and cool seasons played a significant role in the detection of their species of interest. Investigating a species\u2019s migratory and spawning behavior can improve the reliability of eDNA in the same way that traditional sampling methods can be improved [5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Detection results can also be impacted by eDNA degradation, as validating a species\u2019s presence depends on whether there is recent DNA in the surrounding area [6]. Barnes et al. (2014) found that freshwater amphibian eDNA lasted for over two weeks, while marine fish eDNA only lasted for seven days. There are many possible influences for eDNA degradation, such as sunlight or pH [6], so it is important to consider how genetic degradation may impact detections, or lack of. Brys et al. (2020) also reported eDNA degradation rates of close to one week for the 7 fish and 2 amphibian species the researchers were sampling as their control, and cited Barnes et al. (2014) in how high temperatures, UV radiation etc. may be to blame.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eDNA degradation is also accompanied with dispersion, where detections can only be deemed as reliable when they are repeatable in the area. Boothroyd et al. (2016) observed replicate water samples and determined there was variation among the number of positive detections, despite eDNA being highly sensitive to amplification. The study mentions that a downside of eDNA is that actual organisms are not being detected, so DNA could possibly be due to run-off or the remains of a fish [1]. This implies that DNA detections can vary, which may make eDNA collections a better supplement rather than replacement to traditional capture methods.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The type of aquatic ecosystem and species present can influence detection probabilities in many cases as well. Brys et al. (2020) observed a lentic (standing water) system with high eDNA decay rates and distance limitations for DNA retrieval. Metabarcoding was used to detect various species in a pond, where natural water samples were compared to those taken in proximity to a known variety of locally caged species. The 12S genetic marker detected the known fish and amphibians in the area via DNA sequencing in metabarcoding. Positive detections depend on if a lentic or lotic (rushing water) system is being observed, where the flow of water in a lotic system increases the range of eDNA [3]. Species type and density were shown to impact eDNA dispersal rates as well in this case [3], meaning samples taken in proximity to one another could potentially show different detection results due to spatial limitations.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The goal of this review was to demonstrate how eDNA collection and analysis works, and how it can be useful for aquatic species conservation. Various factors, such as the behavior of a species, population density, and sample regions determine whether eDNA can outperform traditional sampling methods. Methodology is often altered to correspond with these factors, as the different species being monitored and types of aquatic systems being observed impact everything from sampling to analyzing. This implies that whether eDNA can replace traditional capture methods will depend on the study itself and what information researchers are seeking. Dubreuil et al. (2021) had greater success in their study using eDNA compared to trapping, noting that eDNA has the potential to detect species at a greater distance than a trap does. Future research should be aimed towards identifying the susceptibility of eDNA degradation and false detections in different bodies of water. The more eDNA is understood, the simpler it becomes to validate findings and lessen reliance on traditional capture methods.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Boothroyd M, Mandrak NE, Fox M, Wilson CC. 2016.

While I have limited experience with cancer and pathology, I hoped to educate myself about a topic that impacts and will continue to impact the life of one of my friends, and improve my medical literacy as well. This review is primarily based on discussing increased risk factors from testicular cancer and treatment, focusing on resulting secondary malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular disease.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the past century, the two most prominent causes of death have been heart disease and cancer [1]. Heart disease disproportionately affects older adults, and cancer typically follows a similar pattern. One exception to this is testicular cancer, which in contrast to most types of cancer, occurs most often in 25-45 year old males [2, 3]. Another defining feature of testicular cancer is the extremely high survival rate in most patients, with most cases hovering around 95%. While this high survival rate is admirable, testicular cancer survivors have an increased risk for long-term effects and cancer recurrence from treatment compared to other cancers. Testicular cancer treatment greatly increases long-term effects from treatment compared to other cancer types treatments because survivors are often younger; the testes themselves are relatively exposed organs compared to the heart, lungs, etc, which makes cancer lumps more easily detectable, but also suggests younger survivors could live with long-term effects for multiple decades [4].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4372 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"326\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-48.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-48-200x127.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-48-300x191.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-48-400x255.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-48.png 512w\" width=\"512\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Caption: A study [10] depicts data collected on ages of TC patients, with a majority of survivors comprising the 25-45 year old age group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Testicular cancer (TC), in its most simplified definition, is the uncontrolled division of cells (cancerous) in testicle tissues of males. Most treatments of TC consist of surgical removal of cancerous tissues, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, with the latter two encompassing more adverse effects. One such effect is the development of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN), which are new cancerous cells that occur because of previous radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy [5].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The chemical drugs used in chemotherapy can also lead to various issues, including infertility, low testosterone, and various heart complications/diseases [6]. By deepening our understanding of the exact connections between TC treatments and their long-term effects, healthcare workers can greatly decrease mortality and improve the quality of life of testicular cancer survivors.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Testicular Cancer</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In order to distinguish when various TC treatments are utilized, there must be an understanding of the many forms and stages of TC. Testicular cancer almost always consists of germ cell tumors, which are cancerous cells that form from germ cells, or the sex cells (sperm in males). Non-germ cell tumor TCs are called stromal tumors; these are cancerous cells formed from supportive tissue in the testes, are relatively rare and can almost always be locally removed with surgery. There are two main types of TC germ cell tumors: seminomas and nonseminomas. Seminomas are localized in the testes and can be treated with surgery and subsequent radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Non-seminomas usually have spread throughout the body and require more intense chemotherapy, with subsequent surgery when needed depending on the stage/observations [7, 8]. These different forms of TC require different treatments; oftentimes patients receive a combination of multiple kinds. Most TC cases consist of germ cell tumors, have to be treated with some sort of radiotherapy/chemotherapy, and enclose many adverse, long-term side effects.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most important designations in a cancer diagnosis is the stage. Cancerous tumors are categorized into five stages, with increasing severity from 0-4. Both Stage 0 and Stage 1indicate cancerous cells in one specific area, and are considered early stage cancers. Stage II and III are used when cancerous cells have expanded to surrounding tissues or the lymph nodes. Cancer cells that have spread are most commonly first found in lymph nodes, where developed cancerous cells can congregate from tissue circulation of the lymphatic system and spread to other organs. When cancerous cells spread past the original organ and lymph nodes, it is then classified as Stage IV, and is considered the most advanced stage of cancer [9].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4374 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"206\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-49.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-49-200x80.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-49-300x121.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-49-400x161.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-49.png 512w\" width=\"512\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Caption: Graphic showing the progression of cancer cell growth within a group of cells in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">five cancer stages [7].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Statistically, most prognoses for TC patients are encouraging. A committee of German cancer statisticians observed that TCs only make up around 1.6% of cancers in men, and 90% of TC cases are diagnosed Stage I or II. On the other hand, TC also can also be categorized by various forms. Stromal or unknown non-germ cell tumors make up around 7% of all TC, while seminomas make up around 62%, and various non-seminomas around 31% [10]. Combined, the high diagnosis rate within early stages and the fact that the majority of cancer cases are localized result in close to a 95% 5-year survival rate, meaning a high number of patients survive for at least 5 years after diagnosis. Not to be overlooked however, is the impact of newly developed treatments of TC in the last 30 years.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Treatment and Side Effects</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most of the adverse effects experienced from testicular cancer survivors are derived from the harsh treatment options available, rather than the cancer itself. So far, attempting to balance long-term effects from medication with sufficient treatment to remove the cancer cells has been proven to be the most successful course of medical care. All forms of TC can utilize surgical removal of tumors as a treatment option. When diagnosed early, surgery is almost always used to remove a testicle to prevent cancerous tissues from spreading. Surgical removal has little to no long-term side effects outside of normal surgical recovery standards.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">More commonly seen with non-seminomas or more advanced stage TCs (stage III/stage IV) is the use of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. While chemotherapy uses specific drugs or drug combinations to target and kill rapidly dividing cells, radiation therapy uses focused radiation to break apart cancer cell DNA, which prevents division [8]. However, chemotherapy and radiation therapy come with different side effects. In chemotherapy of TC specifically, almost all treatments contain bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin. This combination causes especially harsh long term side effects, including infertility, low testosterone, heart diseases and development of secondary cancers [2, 11]. In recent statistical studies tracking TC survivors who have undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy (or a combination of both), researchers have noticed chemotherapy can increase the risk for SMNs and cardiovascular disease (CVD), while radiation therapy greatly increases the risk for SMNs but not necessarily CVD.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4375 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-50.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-50-200x140.png 200w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-50-300x210.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-50-400x280.png 400w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/08/unnamed-50.png 512w\" width=\"512\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Caption: Graph visualization of cancer risk \u2013 blue line is depicting the risk of all cancers after a\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">seminomatous TC diagnosis, compared to the green line representing general population risk of a\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">seminomatous cancer. The red line depicts risk of all cancers after a non-seminomatous TC diagnosis, compared to the general population risk of non-seminomatous TC.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Secondary Malignant Neoplasms</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Healthcare professionals and researchers have long known that radiation and certain chemicals are able to cause cancer. Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs), as they have been termed, are when cancerous cells form outside of the original cancerous organ tissues, because of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In a study published by Bokemeyer and Schmoll, research has suggested, \u201cRadiotherapy is associated with a two- to threefold increased risk for secondary solid tumors\u201d [4]. More recent studies have shown that patients exposed to higher amounts of radiation during treatment are more likely to develop SMNs than patients with lower amounts of exposure, since healthy tissues near cancer cells are exposed to high amounts of radiation at the time of treatment as well [4, 12]. Incidences of SMNs in TC survivors are especially noticeable and impactful; the younger age elicits more time for secondary cancers to occur post-treatment. While it seems that little can be done to combat the development of SMNs caused by radiation therapy during treatment, changes have been made in recent years. When doctors administer treatment of TC, if requiring radiation therapy, they aim to use minimal doses of radiation, and have completely stopped radiation therapy concentrated in the chest area in the past several years [13, 14]. While follow up appointments had been established before the long term effects of TC treatment have been quantified, follow up appointments are now taken more seriously and are being continued for a longer period of time following treatment, with a larger emphasis on secondary cancers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chemotherapy has also seen correlation with development of SMNs after initial treatment. Two of the drugs used in TC treatment, etoposide and cisplatin, have caused secondary malignancies to arise even in treatment of cancers other than TC. Researchers have come to agree that the impact of chemotherapy is less than radiation therapy in terms of development of SMNs. Decades old research has confirmed the correlation between complications following treatment and &gt;4 cycles of cisplatin-based therapy [15]. Cisplatin in TC treatment has specifically been known to lead to increased risk of leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, both of which are related to complications to blood-forming cells in bone marrow. In another study, researchers equated the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy on SMNs and CVD to be similar to smoking, a well known carcinogen (cancer causing agent) [13, 14]. While the individual effects of both chemotherapy and radiation therapy regarding the development of SMNs have been documented, there have been few studies that differentiate the effects of each when both treatment options are combined. Future research surveying older survivors with more long-term effects could be the key to optimizing TC treatment when decreasing SMNs.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>Cardiovascular Disease</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While both chemotherapy and radiation therapy have documented effects of SMNs, radiation therapy has not been connected to greater risk of CVD. However, among the various negative effects of chemotherapy, CVD has been one of the most important causes of premature death in TC survivors.\u00a0 In chemotherapy, cisplatin and bleomycin are heavy metals that with repetitive use, can build up in and weaken heart muscles, as well as cause hearing impairment and infertility [15, 16]. While the effects of bleomycin are similar to other heavy metals used in chemotherapy, cisplatin specifically damages mitochondrial or nuclear DNA of certain cells. This causes mammalian cells using ATP respiration in the mitochondria to create reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are unstable molecules formed from O</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that can then cause damage or cell death when reacted [17]. With repeated chemotherapy treatment, cisplatin can build up in certain areas, and is often the cause of side effects such as hearing loss (cochlea), hair loss (hair follicles), and CVD (inner linings of arteries). However, specifically why cisplatin builds up in certain tissues is currently unknown [11].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cases of CVD from cancer treatment can especially be seen in TC because of the younger age of TC patients. Surviving TC at a mean age of 37 could mean living with an increased risk of CVD for upwards of 40 years. Researchers have attempted to substitute cisplatin with a similar compound called carboplatin in hopes of decreasing the known long-term effects. However, carboplatin has never produced efficient cure rates even while decreasing nerve and hearing damage [18, 15]. As stated before, it is unclear whether the long-term effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy outweigh the monumental success rate of treatment of TC, simply because of the lack of data available from long-term survivors. Eventual data of TC survivors could help determine longer-term impacts of cisplatin in chemotherapy, and help with discussions regarding a need for finding a substitution for cisplatin.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In regards to the post-diagnosis 5 year survival rate of testicular cancer patients, testicular cancer is one of the most survivable cancer types. However, the abnormally young age of TC patients allows us to more easily see the long-term effects of more advanced stage cancer treatment. Both radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been documented to increase risk for secondary malignant neoplasms, with chemotherapy also leading to a large variety of complications, including infertility, low testosterone, and cardiovascular diseases. While certain studies have shown such adverse effects in TC treatment, not enough data has been gathered from treated TC patients who have lived through a larger period of time since treatment. With future studies, researchers could discern the need for alternative treatments to testicular cancer, or methods to prevent the harmful effects of current testicular cancer treatment.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leading Causes of Death.

Available current therapies fail to address the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder, focusing on the amelioration of neuronal symptoms that result from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I was immediately intrigued by the proposal that an existing mechanism for cellular waste removal, chaperone mediated autophagy, could be reinvigorated to remove toxic protein aggregates that are characteristic of an Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis, thereby targeting a significant contributing factor to the disease. This finding paves the way for new therapies that prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cImagine someone has taken your brain and i</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">t\u2019s an old file cabinet and spread all the files over the floor, and you have to put things back together,\u201d describes Greg O\u2019Brian, an award-winning political writer who was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s Disease in 2010. The disorienting feeling described by O\u2019Brian in an interview with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Medical Daily</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is familiar for those diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cMy former life no longer exists, and it\u2019s up to me to create a new life,\u201d explains Chris Hannafan in an interview with PBS Newshour, a year after his Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a progressive brain disorder that leads to memory loss, developmental disabilities, and cognitive impairment. The cause of the disorder appears to be a culmination of a variety of complex factors that arise as we age, such as the degeneration of neuronal pathways, immune system dysfunction, the buildup of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u03b2-amyloid protein, among others [1]</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Due to its composite nature, a cure for the neurodegenerative disorder continues to elude the scientific community and treatment remains focused on palliative care, medical care that is focused on relieving and mediating the symptoms of the disorder.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of the several factors that contribute to an Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis, scientists have recently focused on a cellular process known as chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Autophagy is a critical and versatile cellular mechanism that allows our cells to degrade or eliminate any unnecessary or damaged components [2]. \u201cWithout autophagy, the cell won\u2019t survive,\u201d notes Juleen Zierath, a physiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, in an interview with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nature</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The autophagy process may vary in each cell and is tailored to meet the demands of a specific cells\u2019 workload. CMA refers to a specific form of autophagy that maintains the delicate balance of proteins in the brain through the use of chaperones. Chaperones or cellular \u201chelpers,\u201d lock onto faulty proteins to prevent buildup before being degraded by the cell. Similar to other cellular processes in our body, CMA is naturally less efficient as we age. This may be attributed to the accumulation of dysfunctional proteins and a compromised ability to respond to stressors over time [2]. When the age-dependent decline of CMA is paired with a neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it has been proposed that the age-related inefficiency of CMA is accelerated. This leads to toxic aggregations, or clumps, of damaged proteins that upset the balance of proteins in the brain and entrap functional proteins, generating more blockage. Without CMA, our cell\u2019s cleanup mechanism, this cellular landfill continues to build and begins to interfere with other critical biological processes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In April 2021, Dr. Ana Maria Cuervo and her team of researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine published a breakthrough study that investigated the relationship between inefficient CMA and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [3]. Cuervo, the co-study leader</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and co-director of the Institute for Aging Research at Einstein</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, noted that \u201cthese [mice], similar to the [Alzheimer\u2019s] patients, have decreased memory, develop depression and [have] lack of engagement in general.\u201d Using these mouse models, the first step of the study was to confirm that CMA does, in fact, have an impact on the balance of proteins in the brain. To investigate this, researchers generated a CMA-deficient mouse model through knockout, or removal, of the gene that encodes CMA. When compared against the mice with normal CMA levels, the CMA-deficient mice exhibited characteristics that align with rodent models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These characteristics included reduced short-term memory, abnormal motor skills, and other dysfunctional behaviors. By interfering with the cells\u2019 ability to regulate proteins, this finding proves that the proper balance of proteins in the brain contributes to the maintenance of stable neurological function.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The link between CMA deficiency and abnormal neurological symptoms may also be reversed, further emphasizing the importance of CMA in the brain. In a second experiment, researchers examined whether they could observe deficient CMA in mice that were already diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The results revealed lower levels of CMA activity in the mice that were afflicted with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Ultimately, these findings indicated that in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, CMA activity is decreased and is likely contributing to the harm caused by aggregated proteins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With a more concrete understanding of how CMA plays a role in neurological disorders, Cuervo and her team of researchers created a drug that could be used to treat the CMA-related symptoms observed in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Her vision for this new drug was that \u201cif [we] could increase the removal of these proteins or the cleaning process that occurs normally inside the brain, it might be enough to eliminate toxic proteins.\u201d This pharmaceutical re-energizes a component of the CMA apparatus, allowing a more efficient clearing of protein debris that may otherwise create blockages and eventually manifest in neurological symptoms. In a typical Alzheimer\u2019s patient, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cthe sheer amount of defective protein overwhelms CMA and essentially cripples it,\u201d Cuervo continues. Essentially, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">since the levels of faulty protein are markedly higher in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, the CMA process must be functioning optimally. This new drug, CA, acts as a CMA enhancer by interacting with a</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">receptor, a type of cellular gatekeeper. In a healthy individual, chaperones, or cellular \u201chelpers,\u201d lock onto faulty proteins and guide them to a specific compartment within the cell, the lysosome. A single cell can have hundreds of lysosomes, each of which is tightly sealed from the rest of the cell due to its highly acidic contents. Once the chaperone, faulty protein in hand, has reached the lysosome, it docks to the compartment and releases the protein into the lysosome to be digested. The entry of the faulty proteins into the lysosome is monitored by various cellular gatekeepers present on the surface of the lysosome, one of which is the LAMP2A receptor. Throughout one\u2019s life, the production of the LAMP2A receptor is constant. However, with age, the deterioration of LAMP2A receptors is accelerated. CA specifically targets this challenge by \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[restoring] LAMP2A to youthful levels, enabling CMA to get rid of defective proteins so they can\u2019t form those toxic protein clumps\u201d as explained by Cuervo. By increasing the number of LAMP2A receptors, or gates, on the lysosomal surface, researchers were able to increase the channeling of faulty proteins into the lysosome which acts as the garbage disposal of the cell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This new treatment, despite still being in its early stages of testing, provides an optimistic glance at potentially revolutionizing treatment for those suffering from neurological disorders that are caused by protein aggregation. Although it may be a while before Alzheimer\u2019s patients are free from the daily burden of reorganizing their mental file cabinets, this study sheds light on a previously underscored cellular process and reveals a new avenue for Alzheimer\u2019s research to explore. As Dr. Cuervo concludes, \u201cthis [finding] can be considered as an important step forward, or as a very good proof that enhancing cellular cleaning can be a way to develop therapeutics or interventions that can cure Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">References</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Armstrong RA (2013).

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>One feature that sets humans apart from other primates is the thickness of tooth enamel. Scientists at Duke University have recently discovered evidence on how evolution has resulted in thickened enamel for human teeth. By comparing the human genome to five other primate species, geneticists and evolutionary anthropologists were able to identify two segments of DNA where natural selection may have played a role in giving rise to thick enamel. Differences in enamel thickness have been linked to the difference in diet among primates. Humans consume foods that are tougher to chew relative to the food eaten by other primates, which is why humans have developed thicker enamel through natural selection.<span id=\"more-275\"></span></p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_276\" style=\"width: 235px\"><a data-caption=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Teeth#mediaviewer/File:Baihokkhi_kakkhi.jpgBy Baihokkhi kakkhiWikimedia Commons\" href=\"http://aggietranscript.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/baihokkhi_kakkhi.jpg\"><img alt=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Teeth#mediaviewer/File:Baihokkhi_kakkhi.jpg By Baihokkhi kakkhi  Wikimedia Commons \" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-276\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-276\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://aggietranscript.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/baihokkhi_kakkhi.jpg?w=225\" width=\"225\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-276\">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Teeth#mediaviewer/File:Baihokkhi_kakkhi.jpg<br/>By Baihokkhi kakkhi<br/>Wikimedia Commons</p></div>\n<p>Scientists looked at four genes that have a known role in tooth development, making these good candidates for seeing evidence of positive selection, but not necessarily good candidates for seeing all genes involved in tooth evolution. They then looked at where base pair changes occurred between species, and then among those they looked at which ones occurred at an accelerated rate indicating positive selection. This analysis confirmed that the gene MMP20, already known to influence enamel thickness, was under positive selection as well as a recently discovered gene ENAM. They also found that the changes due to positive selection were in the regulatory regions of the DNA and not protein-coding regions as originally predicted.</p>\n<p>Read more:</p>\n<p><h4></h4></p>\n<p>Julie E.

        "title": "From Embryo to Tumor: the widespread applications of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition",
        "author": "Briga Mullin, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, \u201915",
        "date": "12/01/2014",
        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>What do a smoker, a two week old embryo, a child with a broken wrist, and a metastatic tumor all have in common? While these are a diverse group of conditions, they all have cells that are experiencing the same process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mesenchymal cells are non-polarized, mobile, invasive, and their main function is to secrete extracellular \u00a0matrix. In contrast, epithelial cells form our skin and the linings of our internal organs. They are normally polarized which means they have a directional structure and are uniformly oriented and are attached to a membrane to form a layer of epithelial tissue. \u00a0Under certain conditions an EMT will occur and epithelial cells will change \u00a0their transcription patterns, produce new proteins, destroy the basal membrane they are attached to, and totally convert their phenotype to become motile\u00a0 mesenchymal cells.\u00a0 EMT can be triggered by a variety of conditions and can yield very beneficial or extremely detrimental results depending on the circumstances.<span id=\"more-381\"></span></p>\n<p>The idea of EMT is fascinating because cellular development is usually thought of as moving from simple towards more differentiated. However, EMT is just the opposite of that. The orderly tissue layer of epithelial\u00a0 cells degenerates into simple undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.\u00a0 It is also worth noting that this process can occur in reverse with mesenchymal cells converting to epithelial cells. This process is known as mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET). In MET, cells differentiate to form more complex structure, which is a more intuitive process than EMT.\u00a0 There are cases where cells can perform multiple ETMs and METs, changing their phenotype back and forth, demonstrating a highly plastic nature\u00a0.</p>\n<p>EMT was first discovered in developing embryos, \u00a0where a high level of plasticity is necessary. In our two week old embryo, the three germ layers,\u00a0. Parts of the ectoderm undergo EMT to eventually become endoderm and mesoderm. Later on, EMT is also essential for the development of neural crest cells from neural ectoderm. Thinking about all the changes and developments that go into converting an embryo to a full formed organism,\u00a0 it seems reasonable that there are mechanisms in place to drastically change cell structure and function.\u00a0 This class of EMT, known as type I, is completely essential \u00a0for all development. However, not all instances of EMT are so straightforward\u00a0.</p>\n<p>The smoker and the child with a broken wrist are both experiencing the same form of EMT known as type II EMT, which is caused by irritation and inflammation\u00a0. When activated by injury or irritation, fibroblast cells that produce extracellular matrix and bone marrow release molecules that can trigger EMT in neighboring epithelial cells by degrading the basal membrane. This is another example of a situation where EMT is very useful. When there is damage to tissues, EMT creates more mesenchymal cells to secrete growth factors and extracellular matrix, which are necessary to heal damage. However, if inflammation and irritation are caused by a long term stressor such as smoking, too many cells activate an EMT program for too long. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),\u00a0 is a condition where airflow is limited because scarring and swelling in the narrow branches of the lungs make it hard for air to reach sites for gas exchange. The primary cause of COPD\u00a0 is smoking and the mechanisms by which the lungs are affected include EMT induced by cigarette smoke and production of ECM by fibroblasts. Epithelial cells in bronchioles and alveoli experience EMT,\u00a0 and the newly created mesenchymal cells produce excess collagen thickening and hardening the lungs.</p>\n<p>While fibrosis in the lungs or other organs due to type II EMT has serious consequences, the metastatic tumor is the most dangerous example of EMT. When an cancer of the epithelial cells, known as carcinoma, spreads to another area of the body, the key mechanism for the migration of tumor cells is type III EMT. When epithelial tumor cells undergo an EMT, they become motile and invasive mesenchymal tumor cells. If these cells spread throughout the body and successfully colonize new tissues, the primary tumor has become metastatic, and the cancer is significantly more dangerous and difficult to treat.</p>\n<p>The process of EMT and its many applications in the body are proof that at all stages of life cellular differentiation has some flexibility. Clearly, this has benefits and drawbacks depending on the scenario. It is appears contradictory that the process of EMT is absolutely necessary for a zygote to develop and grow, but also creates a deadly cancer. Hopefully by furthering the research on the triggers that cause EMT and MET, we can better understand and control this process\u00a0. Current research includes looking at micro RNAs to regulate cells undergoing EMT and, determining environmental conditions, such as signals sent from neighboring cells, that can induce EMT.</p>\n<p>Refrences</p>\n<p>Andriani, Francesca et. al.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>A group of researchers studying brain cells have found a new potential target for pharmacological therapies that may help treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Beta amyloid plaque, which appears to be a toxic build up of fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain, has long been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and has been one of the major targets for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment. Amyloid precursor protein plays an important role in the brain, and when this protein is broken down in nerve cells the toxic byproduct beta amyloid is formed. <span id=\"more-247\"></span>Cellular compartments enclosed by a membrane, called vesicles, are responsible for transporting proteins such as APP throughout the cell. Vesicles are usually stabilized by groups of proteins that keep the vesicle together so that the APP is \u2018shipped\u2019 to where it needs to go without being degraded. The group of proteins responsible for stabilizing the vesicles used for APP is called the retromer complex.</p>\n<p>Evidence suggests that defects in the retromer complex of a neuronal cell lead to higher levels of beta amyloid in neurons, and potential weaknesses in the retromer complex have been previously found. The protein interactions at the junction of the proteins of the retromer could be weakened, which leads to a degradation and reduction in the amount of retromer complex in the cell. Lower levels of retromer complex can lead to an increase of APP breakdown because the vesicles holding the APP are no longer being \u2018protected\u2019 by the retromer complex. The breakdown of APP can then lead to the formation of beta amyloid plaque in brain cells. \u00a0The researchers used imaging and computer modeling to predict compositions of small molecules that could bind and strengthen the interactions at the protein-protein interfaces of the retromer, thus leading to more structural stability and higher concentrations of the retromer complex in cells. The researchers tested one so-called chaperone, R55, with in vitro studies of cultured neural cells of the hippocampus. When compared to a control, introduction of R55 was shown to increase retromer levels in the hippocampal neurons. This establishes proof of concept that pharmacological chaperone molecules could be used to stabilize the retromer complex and lead to reduction of beta amyloid formation. In vivo studies need to be done to confirm these small molecules can have an actual therapeutic effect in patients suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Mecozzi, Vincent J, Berman, Diego E, Simoes, Sabrina, Vetanovetz, Chris, Awal, Mehraj R, et al.(2014) Pharmacological chaperones stabilize retromer to limit APP processing.

They compared the results to those of people living in Italy, and found that the two groups have very different species composition. The Hadza don\u2019t only have different kinds of gut microbes than Westerners, but a more diverse collection of microbes as well.

This is the first time that such a disparity has been documented in humans. This may be because of the sexual division of labor among that Hadzu; women tend to forage for tubers and other plant foods, while men travel farther to procure honey and meat.

This study was conducted on five patients between ages 76 and 88 who had significant nasal damage after skin cancer surgery. One year after the replacement, all of them note significant improvement in the ability to breathe as well as cosmetic appeal, and no patients had significant side effects. This is a groundbreaking study as it opens of the possibility of engineered cartilage replacement in other areas, such as the knee, and of tissue-engineering as a whole.<span id=\"more-197\"></span></p>\n<p>These cartilage cells were extracted from the patients\u2019 nasal septum. The desired cells, chondrocytes, were then isolated and multiplied before being cultured in a collagen membrane for two weeks. This resulted in an implant about forty times as large as the original biopsy. The cells were then shaped according to the correct replacement size and implanted. While not yet clinically available, these new engineered grafts could become a less invasive alternative to natural skin grafts taken from other parts of the body, which can be painful and susceptible to infection. Current studies are looking into the expansion of this same cartilage to possible knee surgeries.</p>\n<p>Ilario Fulco, Sylvie Miot, Martin D Haug, Andrea Barbero, Anke Wixmerten, Sandra Feliciano, Francine Wolf, Gernot Jundt, Anna Marsano, Jian Farhadi, Michael Heberer, Marcel Jakob, Dirk J Schaefer, Ivan Martin. <h4>Engineered autologous cartilage tissue for nasal reconstruction after tumour resection  an observational first-in-human trial</h4>. <i>The Lancet</i>, 2014; DOI: <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60544-4\">10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60544-4</a></p>\n</div>",

I have since looked deeper into yeast and the fermentation process, gaining a special interest in yeast-related research. I wrote this paper in order to discover more about the unique qualities of yeast and fermentation while informing others about this microorganism\u2019s relevance to humans and other scientific processes.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1540\"></span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In December of 2016, Walters, et al. released a scientific article detailing the discovery of mRNA that were capped by nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD). Typically, mRNA are capped at the 5\u2019 end by an adenine triphosphate (ATP) molecule, which provides a signal to RNA polymerase II that allows for the initiation of transcription (Zhang 2013). When studying the mRNAs of saccharomyces cerevisiae, a species of yeast, it was found that a molecule of NAD was attached to the 5\u2019 end of mRNAs that coded for ribosomal proteins and \u201cmitochondrial encoded transcripts\u201d (Walters 2016).</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is important to recognize the significance of this discovery. Yeast are widely used in society, especially for brewing beer and baking bread. Throughout this process, yeast enzymes carry out glycolysis and alcoholic fermentation using NAD and ATP as organic cofactors, which are molecules that assist enzymes in carrying out vital activities. These two molecules are often simultaneously active in the same metabolic pathways. It is evident that NAD and ATP are necessary molecules and have likely evolved to be so important to cellular mechanisms due to their comparable chemical structures and the fact that NAD is a metabolite of ATP (Berg 2002). NAD is synthesized in cells through two pathways, either by the combination of amino acids or by the recycling of components that are structurally similar to NAD (Belenky 2007). </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NAD is a necessary element for ATP production in glycolysis, which is partially regulated by ribosomal proteins. In 2011, a scientific study found that targeting a ribosomal protein called S6K1 led to the suppression of glycolysis in mammalian cells (Tandon 2011). NAD also acts as a cofactor in gluconeogenesis within mitochondria, and its cousin NADPH is involved in the pentose phosphate pathway that is used by cells to regenerate five-carbon sugars, which are building blocks for DNA and other critical cellular components. Adachi, et al. was able to use NAD-dependent and NAD-independent dehydrogenases in acetic acid bacteria to discover the responsibilities of other enzymes involved in oxidative fermentation and the pentose phosphate pathway (Adachi 2014). Dehydrogenases are involved in the transfer of hydrogen atoms and electrons in metabolic reactions. Understanding which dehydrogenases require NAD reveals information about the mechanisms involved in the formation of cellular products.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Information such as this can be vitally important to professionals in brewing and viticulture who are studying the effects of different chemicals or additives to the fermentation process. If the requirements of yeast are further studied, researchers may discover that an increase in NAD could lead to an increase in ribosomal proteins that are necessary for glycolysis. Results like this could yield profitable technology to scientists who are in search of innovative ways to improve the enzymatic activity of yeast. For example, NADH is used as a cofactor to the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to regenerate NAD in the last step of alcoholic fermentation, where ethanol is produced. A typical beer fermentation lasts approximately fourteen days. Large-scale brewing is tightly scheduled and could hypothetically benefit from increased levels of NAD to improve enzymatic processes and thus decrease fermentation periods. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Walters, et al. also suspects that NAD-capped mRNAs are present in other eukaryotic cells. This could prove important to the future evolution of proteins within yeast and mammals. If RNA polymerase II and other transcription factors are able to more widely recognize NAD as an initiation signal, then it is feasible that more mRNAs can be transcribed and subsequently more proteins will be expressed within cells. A discovery like this could redefine yeast\u2019s role in fermentation, giving these unicellular organisms the ability to convert sugar to ethanol more efficiently, or even the ability to produce new esters and phenols that provide unique flavors to beer. It may even be possible that other cofactors could be discovered as caps to a small percentage of mRNAs (Furuichi 2015), potentially revealing evolutionary and genetic differences between species and cell types that could allow scientists to make clearer distinctions and connections between living organisms. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Works Cited</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adachi, O., Fujii, Y., Ano, Y., Moonmangmee, D., Toyama, H., Shinagawa, E., . . .

I believe it is important to inform people about mental disabilities other than the most commonly seen disorders, such as Down Syndrome or autism. This paper serves to educate readers about Christianson Syndrome, an X-linked genetic disorder that, although phenotypically similar to more widely-known disorders, is actually quite different at the genetic level.\u201d</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-1214\"></span></p>\n<p>Christianson Syndrome (CS) is a genetic disorder that was first studied in 1999, when a South African family noticed the prevalence of an autism-like disorder in their sons. Many more cases have been discovered since then, and it is estimated that CS affects 1 in 16,000 to 100,000 people. Symptoms of this disorder include postnatal microcephaly, ataxia, hyperkinesis, lack of speech, developmental disabilities, and epilepsy. Despite these negative symptoms, those with the disorder exhibit a happy demeanor and unprovoked bouts of laughter in infancy. CS is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern and is caused by mutations on the SLC9A6 gene (Genetics Home Reference 2016).</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The SLC9A6 gene encodes the NHE6 protein, which is a sodium/hydrogen ion exchanger protein located within early and recycling endosomes. Endosomes are responsible for the sorting and transport of materials throughout the cell (Contento &amp; Bassham, 2012). The most common mutations observed in the gene are base pair deletions of as few as 2 to 9 bases. A few studies have shown that the mutations arise from transitions and transversions, as well as splice-site mutations involving the misplacement of exons within the gene (OMIM 2015). These mutations result in a shortened, less functional version of the protein. Specifically, NHE6 becomes unable to pump hydrogen ions out of the endosome, making endosomes throughout the body, and particularly in nerve cells, increasingly acidic and less effective. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Various scientific studies collectively support the idea that the regulation of endosomal pH is critical to the development of fully functional nerve cells. In 2013, Ouyang, et al. published a study on the effects of NHE6 mutations on mice brains. One of their most significant findings was that NHE6-rich endosomes are highly \u201clocalized in growing axons and dendrites\u201d (Ouyang et al. 2013). Other studies discovered that endosomes have specific levels of acidity relative to their position in a growing nerve cell (Overly, et al. 1995). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The NHE6 protein works alongside Tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) within the endosomes to regulate intravesicular pH and moderate neuronal differentiation and growth. TrkB binds brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNFs) to promote the development and survival of functional nerve cells. BDNFs are found to be prevalent in areas of the brain that control learning, memory, and higher thinking. When NHE6 is absent, endosomal pH drops to abnormal levels, which attenuates TrkB signaling and weakens the TrkB-BDNF interaction (Ouyang et al. 2013). Without these signals, the neuronal cells in the surrounding environment are unable to grow to their full potential (Sunderland 2014). The resulting phenotype is a widespread depletion of neuronal circuits characterized by decreased dendritic arborization and diminished cell communication.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the exact cause of CS remains undetermined, Ouyang, et al. and Overly, et al. provide valuable insight into how simple protein mutations can result in astronomical phenotypic abnormalities in nerve cells. All of the symptoms of CS can be linked back to the disruption of the brain\u2019s regulatory pathways of neuronal growth. These studies highlight that improper formation of proteins can easily lead to the attenuation of related cell processes, and can even result in the diminished development of particular cell types. CS is one of the most common X-linked intellectual disabilities. As it gains awareness, the scientific community is becoming \u00a0increasingly active in finding the cure to this intriguing disease.</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Contento, A.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><h4>Author\u2019s Note</h4></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">\u201cI decided to write this piece after seeing news headlines announcing the potential of life on planets in a nearby star system. As this is a topic that fascinates many people, myself included, I decided to investigate the new discoveries. While the research on the particular planet mentioned in the various news articles is still fairly new, it has brought about renewed interest in the search for life beyond our planet. This article aims to describe what these recent discoveries are, and show the implications they have for astronomers.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span id=\"more-965\"></span></p>\n<p>With numerous movies, TV shows, and books in popular culture depicting fascinating stories about alien visits to Earth, it is easy to simply regard the subject of extraterrestrial life forms as science fiction. However, recent discoveries are demonstrating that ideas about life outside of Earth may not be so far-fetched.</p>\n<p>Alpha Centauri, a star system located 4.3 light years away from our solar system, is comprised of three stars: Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B, and Proxima Centauri. Although scientists have known about this star system for centuries, the discovery in late 2016 of a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima b, has sparked new interest in this star system.</p>\n<p>Proxima b, a planet similar in size to Earth, initially looked like a good candidate for life, as it is located in the habitable zone of its star, meaning that it could support liquid water. However, as research on this planet has continued, conflicting arguments have arisen about whether or not life on this planet is possible.</p>\n<p>Proxima b orbits two class M dwarf stars, a type of red dwarf star, in contrast to our sun, which is a yellow dwarf. Although not much is known about red dwarf stars, it is thought that their habitable region is located very close to the star due to the lower temperature, thus putting the nearby planet at risk of radiation and solar flares. Consequently, some scientists argue that water and life are not probable on Proxima b.</p>\n<p>In contrast, other scientists believe that life there is in fact possible. Simulations conducted at the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science in Seattle, Washington have demonstrated that if certain conditions are met, Proxima b could support life. For instance, if the planet has a strong magnetic field, or if past water evaporation created an oxygen-rich atmosphere, life on this planet is certainly feasible. Additionally, as red dwarfs take longer to burn out into a white dwarf than yellow dwarfs do, researchers argue that this longer lifespan allows more time for complex life to evolve.</p>\n<p>The discovery of a potentially habitable planet has generated excitement with regards to finding more planets in the Alpha Centauri star system. Breakthrough Initiatives and the European Southern Observatory (ESO), two groups with goals to explore our vast universe, have partnered together for a project that involves studying Alpha Centauri. Both of these groups have the ultimate goal of finding intelligent life beyond Earth and are thus searching for planets that have the ability to support life, as discoveries in this area would prove to be beneficial to human civilization for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the groups will be utilizing ESO\u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile to examine the star system in detail, in an effort to identify any other planets in the habitable zones around the stars. Furthermore, they will continue to investigate Proxima b to learn more about whether or not life is possible.</p>\n<p>Although these discoveries about the potential for life on other planets are different from how alien life forms are typically portrayed in movies, these recent findings breathe life into to the idea that we may not be alone in the universe.</p>\n<p>Sources</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Billings, Lee. \u201cA Breakthrough in the Search for Alpha Centauri\u2019s Planets.\u201d Scientific American.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\">Author\u2019s Note:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cI originally became interested in the potential anti-cancer effects of blueberries when I took a nutrition seminar my first year at UC Davis. Curious about further research on its effects on breast cancer, I decided to write an article to educate other students about it. Many of us either have a family member or know someone diagnosed with cancer, so spreading knowledge of current cancer research is an important reminder of support, hope, and determination to individuals and their families.\u201d</span><span id=\"more-928\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Breast cancer is the second most fatal cancer to women worldwide, and although early detection screening and treatments have improved, there is still a high death rate. The American Cancer Society predicts a death toll of 40,890 women in 2016 due to breast cancer. Most of these fatalities will result from metastasis, in which cancer cells in the body grow to large proportions, disrupting the functions of other organs. Although there is no cure for breast cancer, chemotherapy has proven successful at eliminating the unhealthy cells in some patients. While these preventative treatments are focused on preventing harmful cells from replicating and surviving, they are also toxic to beneficial cells in the body. Scientists\u2019 interest in decreasing the damage to healthy bystander cells in cancer patients led to research into alternative treatment methods. These alternative methods consist of experimenting with natural chemicals found in blueberries against various cancer cells. Two metabolic studies, one published in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The American Journal of Surgery</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> and the second in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Molecular Nutrition and Food Research</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, researched the effect of natural blueberry chemicals on breast cancer cells and disease prevention.</span></p>\n<p>Previous studies have shown that eating more fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of cancer<sup>2</sup>. Specifically, blueberries contain phytochemicals, or plant chemicals, that have been linked to reductions in the risk of major chronic diseases. Pterostilbene is a phytochemical isolated from blueberries that has been shown to reverse the process of harmful cell mutation by halting the growth of cancer cells, decreasing their reproduction rate and causing cell death<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>Scientists from Taipei Medical University tested if consuming blueberries helps lower the risk of breast cancer and published their findings in the <em>Molecular Nutrition and Food Research Journal</em>.<sup>3</sup> The scientists treated cells with pterostilbene to explore the effects of the chemical on cancer stem cells<sup>3</sup>. The results showed cells treated with pterostilbene significantly decreased cancer cell reproductive activity after 72 hours.<sup>\u00a0 </sup>In addition, the treated tumor cells showed a significant increase of DNA fragmentation and degraded structure, because the chemical has potential to destroy already existing cells<sup>4</sup>. Even though the blueberry chemical has been shown to have anti-cancer effects, more research is needed to confirm if pterostilbene can be used as an additive drug for breast cancer treatment, as well as other types of cancer.</p>\n<p>To test how pterostilbene can act as an additive treatment, researchers treated high risk and diagnosed cancer patients with tamoxifen as a preventative plan. Tamoxifen is a hormone that attaches to breast tissue cells and keeps the already deactivated estrogen receptors from activating. Activated estrogen receptors are likely to be attached to cancerous cells and reproduce, so tamoxifen may play an important role in cancer suppression. In a metabolic study published in <em>The American Journal of Surgery, </em>researchers combined tamoxifen and pterostilbene and hypothesized that the two chemicals would produce an additive effect in impeding breast cancer cells from dividing <sup>5</sup>. The results of this metabolic study show that using both chemicals to treat cancer cells has a greater impact than treating the disease using only one chemical<sup>5</sup>.</p>\n<p>Overall study results have shown that supplemental use of pterostilbene, a natural ingredient in blueberries, can help reduce the risk of breast cancer. Consuming a diet containing fruits and vegetables can help reduce risk of cancer because other natural plant chemicals may potentially work together to produce better anti-cancer effects. Therefore, naturally consumed pterostilbene and additional natural plant chemicals should be studied further as an additive treatment to reduce toxic chemicals put in the bodies of breast cancer patients.</p>\n<p>References</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Aiyer H, Warri A.

        "body": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>Author\u2019s Note:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">\u201cI chose to write this piece to familiarize myself with the most recent scientific literature on Mitofusin 2 for my UWP104E Writing in Science class. I was preparing to apply for the Undergraduate Research Center Provost Undergraduate Fellowship and felt this would be a good way to inform myself about a protein related to my own undergraduate project in Jodi Nunnari\u2019s lab. \u00a0I was puzzled that different experiments could lead to such conflicting findings on the same issue; thus, writing this review was an invaluable learning experience for me as both an undergraduate student and scientist.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span id=\"more-883\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In mammalian cells, mitochondria are not only essential to energy production in the form of ATP, but they also play regulatory roles in overall metabolism and cell component recycling. \u00a0Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s have previously been linked to defects in mitochondria morphology, hinting that mitochondrial form greatly affects both cell homeostasis and mitochondrial function</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0\u00a0Mitochondria maintain their function by ensuring proper mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) distribution throughout the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, mitochondria have their own genome encoding 13 proteins essential for cellular respiration, as well as 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0The distribution of this mtDNA is maintained by balanced fusion and fission of the mitochondrial membranes;</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> moreover, recent data has shown that mtDNA synthesis precedes endoplasmic reticulum-mediated mitochondrial division (ERMD), suggesting that mtDNA biogenesis plays a role in maintaining mitochondria morphology</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">3,4</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Additionally, these ER-mitochondria contact sites prove to not only be essential for mtDNA synthesis, but also for lipid and calcium exchange</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">5,7</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enzymes required for phospholipid biogenesis are enriched at these contact sites, where a fraction of precursors, such as phosphotidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, are imported from the ER to the mitochondria inner membrane for modification into various lipids crucial for cellular function</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">5,6</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Additionally, calcium import from the ER to the mitochondria is key for processes that require Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> binding, such as mitochondria motility, apoptotic signaling and energy production cascades</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">7,8</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Without these ER-mitochondria contact sites, both mitochondrial and cellular function are disrupted.</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u00a0From a clinical view, abnormal mitochondria morphology, lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis are cellular phenotypes present in Alzheimer\u2019s patients</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. Thus, a structure that tethers the two organelles together is essential for preserving overall cellular and bodily function. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In yeast, the ER and mitochondria are tethered by the ER-mitochondrial encounter structure (ERMES), a tetrameric complex that facilitates various biological processes between the two organelles</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">9</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Although the discovery of ERMES provided great insight on contact sites in yeast, the proteins composing ERMES do not have mammalian orthologs. \u00a0This lack of mammalian orthologs caused many scientists to look to other proteins that have potential tethering ability. \u00a0Two potential candidates, mammalian proteins Mitofusin 1 and Mitofusin 2 (MFN1, MFN2), 80% homologous dynamin-related GTPases, facilitate outer mitochondrial membrane fusion to maintain proper morphology and mtDNA distribution</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2,10</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Because these proteins have the ability to connect one mitochondria to another, they were identified as tethering candidates, and their functions became subject to further investigation</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Mitofusin 2 Proposed as an Er-Mitochondria Tethering Agent Through Light Microscopy</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Subsequently, de Brito and Scorrano proposed Mitofusin 2, specifically, as an ER-mitochondria tether based on light microscopy data suggesting decreased mitochondria-ER contacts in MFN2 KO mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs). \u00a0Scrutiny of the enrichment of MFN2 at mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs) on the ER by immunofluorescence analysis in these cells suggested that the amount of ER-mitochondria association was reduced in MFN2 KO cells, but not MFN1 KO cells</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0This group also determined that 59% of total MFN2 in the cell was present at MAM. \u00a0To observe the extent of MFN2\u2019s role on each organelle\u2019s tethering capability, they synthesized a MFN2 mutant restricted to the mitochondria membrane (MFN2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">ActA</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">). \u00a0While MFN2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">ActA</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> restored mitochondria morphology and not ER tethering ability, expressing a MFN2 mutant restricted to the ER membrane (MFN2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">cb5</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">) restored ER morphology and tethering, but not that of the mitochondria</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Together, these data suggest that MFN2 is embedded at the ER surface and is a mammalian ER-mitochondria tethering agent</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Critics, however, suggested further investigation on what happens to these contact sites over time in the absence of MFN2, as not all ER-mitochondria contacts give rise to mitochondria division and chemical transport</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Additionally, light microscopy only indicates colocalization (points of overlapping fluorescence) and cannot prove or disprove physical interactions. \u00a0Thus, in order to accept this proposal these critics called for \u00a0more data quantification with higher resolution microscopy</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">12,13</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mitofusin 2 Decreases Tethering by Electron Microscopy</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Following this publication, Cosson et al. quantified more data and used higher resolution electron microscopy (EM) to observe increased ER mitochondria contacts in MFN2 KO MEF cells, thereby contradicting the previous light microscopy data</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Whereas light microscopy\u2019s resolution is limited to observing the whole cell in tens of micrometers, electron microscopy allows scrutiny of one individual contact site within hundreds of nanometers. \u00a0Observation of these cells via EM indicated that WT MEF cells had approximately 50% fewer mitochondria membranes juxtaposed to the ER than that of MFN2 KO MEF cells: this group speculates that the differences in their data and that of the previous group were due to microscope resolution</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Additionally, when over-expressing MFN2 protein levels, these scientists observed a decreased number of ER-mitochondria contacts; together, these data provide high resolution, quantitative evidence that Mitofusin 2 is not a tether between the ER and mitochondria, and that Mitofusin 2 actually decreases their association</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Because this study provided contradicting evidence for a previously accepted model, there remained a need for a third party to verify or dismiss these findings. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Negative Regulation of Er-mitochondria contact sites via Mitofusin 2</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Filadi et al. investigated the discrepancy between the two groups\u2019 opposing findings and repeated experiments in both confocal and electron microscopy. After duplicating both experiments and reaching the same opposing conclusions as the previous two groups, they determined that the discrepancy lies within electron microscopy\u2019s 80x more magnification, making EM more suitable for observing the mitochondria outer membrane perimeter</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">13</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0By quantifying the data via confocal microscopy in a way that accounts for this difference, they determined that cells lacking MFN2 actually have increased overlapping ER and mitochondria perimeter, supporting Cosson et al.\u2019s electron microscopy data. \u00a0To rigorously test the idea that MFN2 is not a tether, contact stability\u2014as opposed to number of contacts\u2014was measured over time in the absence of MFN2 via confocal microscopy. \u00a0Because overlapping fluorescence may occur randomly, and only a subset of ER-mitochondria contacts persist and give rise to division or chemical import, measuring contact stability indicates whether these functions can still occur normally within cells lacking MFN2 protein. \u00a0Ultimately, the stability of these contact sites was unaffected by the presence or absence of MFN2, negating MFN2 as a tethering agent</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">13</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0To that end, this group attributes the contrasting findings to differences in biochemical techniques, as they both used light microscopy to come to opposite conclusions</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Critical reappraisal arguing Mitofusin 2 is an Er-mitochondria tether</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In response to Cosson et al. and Filadi et al., Scoranno\u2019s group recently published exhaustive data using novel biochemical and cellular techniques to demonstrate that Mitofusin 2 is in fact an ER-mitochondria tether</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0After considering the differences in data quantification, this group developed a new system to evaluate contact sites: they considered both the distance between the ER and mitochondria and overlapping perimeters. \u00a0They report that this newly quantified data still supports the idea that MFN2 KO cells have reduced contacts. \u00a0To further test whether MFN2 is a tether, they used a dimerization-dependent fluorescent marker that will only fluoresce if two molecules targeted to different areas of the cell are in close proximity. \u00a0From these experiments, it was determined that cells lacking MFN2 have reduced fluorescence, again supporting their previous conclusion that Mitofusin 2 is an ER-mitochondria tether. \u00a0They ascribe the mismatch in experimental findings to methods of cell culture, stating that if cells become too confluent on a petri dish, it can affect mitochondria calcium reuptake and tethering ability</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Scrutiny of previous studies on calcium transfer, as well as future studies exploring not only Mitofusin 2, but also other proteins active at contact sites, will help validate MFN2 as a tether and identify other potential tethering agents necessary for cellular function. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Area-Gomez, E. et al.

The difficulty of developing such vaccines is due to the often inhospitable environment of the stomach and intestinal tract because of low pH, or acidity, as well as enzymes that can digest or destroy biological molecules. Using a virus-like particle to deliver the vaccine is an advantageous method for getting around these and other barriers in the host organism.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A virus-like particle, or VLP, is a biological particle that resembles a virus, but contains no genetic information and thus cannot infect host cells. VLP\u2019s can be formed by inserting and expressing just the genes for creating the viral capsid, which is a shell made up of protein subunits that protects the infectious genetic information in wild-type, or normal, viruses. The expressed capsid proteins can then self-assemble into the VLP. The capsid also has domains, or structural areas, that are responsible for recognizing suitable host cells to infect and inserting the viral genome.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-145\"></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The use of a VLP does, however, pose another challenge. The capsid has a domain which can contain an epitope, which is a small structural region of the capsid that can be bound to by antibodies. A host organism can then acquire immunity to the specific VLP that has been developed as carrier of the vaccine, also called a vector, which would trigger the immune system of the host to destroy the virus before successful delivery of the vaccine. Researchers at the UC Davis PIOMS Institutional Program led by Dr. Holland Cheng have made significant progress in developing a solution to this dilemma.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The researchers used the hepatitis E virus, or HEV, as a viral vector for an oral vaccine. In order to escape the anti-HEV immunity of the host, which could have been acquired through actual infection or repeated use of the same vector, the researchers had to mutate, or modify, the region on the capsid that is recognized by the immune system. The researchers took a short amino acid sequence derived from the structure of the HIV-1 virus that stimulated an immune response and inserted it into the epitope, which in the antibody-binding site of the HEV VLP. The researchers in effect swapped out the epitope of the HEV capsid and inserted an epitope of the HIV-1 virus using recombinant DNA technology, and were able to produce these fusion VLP\u2019s that were derived from more than one organism, in this case HEV and HIV-1.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new VLP was then tested to see how it would interact with antibodies for HEV and HIV-1, respectively. As expected, the new VLP reacted strongly with the antibody against the HIV-1 epitope, confirming that the insertion of the HIV-1 epitope into the HEV capsid had been a success. However, the new VLP barely reacted at all with the antibody against HEV, with a 1-2% reactivity compared to a wild-type control HEV VLP, whose reactivity was set at 100%. The researchers then tested the structural integrity of the new capsid. Previous attempts had been made to mutate the capsid of HEV, but the insertion made at different places had always interfered with the structural assembly of the capsid protein complex. Such interference can negatively impact its resilience against digestive enzymes, specifically proteolytic (protein digesting) enzymes commonly found in the digestive tract, such as trypsin. When in the presence of trypsin, the new VLP did experience some proteolytic cleavage at the individual protein subunits, the capsid still held, and the structure was preserved. Future research can be done to explore other inserts into the HEV VLP vector that might bind to other specific areas, which could be used to target therapies to specific regions while taking advantage of the protective benefits and primary infection site of the HEV VLP capsid.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jariyapong P, Xing L, van Houten NE, Li TC, Weerachatyanukul W, Hsieh B, Moscoso CG, Chen CC, Niikura M, Cheng RH. <h4>Chimeric hepatitis E virus-like particle as a carrier for oral-delivery</h4>.
