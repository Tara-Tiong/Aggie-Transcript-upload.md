<strong>Author's Note:</strong> <span>I wrote this literature review as part of my UWP 104F class with Dr. Lisa Sperber. The assignment was to choose a clinically-relevant topic, review the existing body of literature on this topic, and choose a specific area to write on. My topic of interest was about the relationship between gut microbiome and the brain. I became interested in this topic after reading an article about the differences between the microbial composition of individuals with depression. By the end of the quarter, my research question evolved from “how does our diet affect our brain or mood?” to “how does modulation of gut microbiome affect depression pathophysiology?” I enjoyed the flexibility of the assignment, and I greatly benefited from the guidance provided by Dr. Sperber. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in health-related fields, especially in research!</span>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span>Depression is a stress-related disorder affecting more than 350 million people and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (1).</span>
<span>Development of depression is strongly correlated with the prognosis of chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma, and heart diseases (2).</span>
<span>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed class of medications for depression (3). However, 30% of patients develop resistance to treatment over time, and more than 68% of patients discontinue the use after 3 months due to lack of improvement or development of adverse effects (3, 4). The exact mechanism of SSRIs is not fully understood, which is limiting researchers from adequately addressing these problems (4). Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of depression is crucial to developing more effective treatments (1).
   </span>

<span> The gut-brain axis is a topic of growing discussion that can provide means for depression treatment (5).</span> <span>The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract regulated by the gut microbiome (5). The gut microbiome plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many physiological and psychological disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (5), autism spectrum disorder (6),</span><span> Parkinson’s disease (7), and </span><span>depression (5)</span><span>.</span> <span>Microbiome composition is influenced by genetics, use of antibiotics, smoking habits, diet, and age, and disruption of microbial composition inducing changes in behavior and mood (9,10). Gut-brain interactions occur through the neuroendocrine, nervous, and immune systems (9). However, the mechanism through which microbiome affects depression status is unclear (11). </span>

<span>In this review, I will provide a comprehensive overview of the three pathways involved in the gut-brain axis: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis pathway involving the neuroendocrine system, the cytokines pathway involving the immune system, and the neurotransmitter pathways involving the nervous system. Then, I will describe how microbiome modulation affects these pathways and consequently depression symptoms. </span>

<b>HPA Axis</b>

<span>The HPA axis is hyperactive in 40-60% of patients diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (14). It is the central reactivity response system in the brain (12). Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin (VAP) are normally released from the hypothalamus, which subsequently trigger the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. In response to ACTH, glucocorticoids, like cortisol, are released from the adrenal cortex to regulate immunity, metabolism, and mood (13).</span>

<span>The hyperactivity of HPA is indicated by three markers: 1) enlargement of the pituitary and adrenal glands, 2) elevated CRH levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, and 3) elevated glucocorticoids levels in plasma, saliva, and urine (15).</span> <span>Sudo et al. used germ-free mice to test the effects of microbiome on the HPA axis (16). Germ-free mice had significantly higher responses to stress compared to control as indicated by the elevated levels of ACTH and corticosterone (16). However, the introduction of </span><i><span>Bifidobacterium infantis</span></i><span>, a common bacterial species usually found in the guts of most mammals, restored the normal levels (16). Interestingly, childhood traumatic life events like physical or sexual abuse are also associated with higher cortisol release accompanied by alteration in fecal microbiota (17, 18). This demonstrates a top-down relationship in which the brain indirectly influences the gut, thus corroborating the bidirectionality of the gut-brain axis (13).</span>

<b>Cytokines </b>

<span>Depression is associated with the hyperactivation of the immune system, indicated by overproduction of immune cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines (19).</span> <span>Pro-inflammatory cytokines are biomarkers usually elevated during infection and inflammation (20).</span> <span>C</span><span>ytokines like TNF-a and IL-6 are found at levels significantly higher in depressed individuals (19, 21)</span><span>. </span><span>A recent study investigated the causal relationship between depression and cytokines levels (8). First, stress was induced to mice using the Maternal Separation model, a standardized method to study mental health in rodents where a brief maternal absence in early life significantly alters behavior (8). Then, depression levels were assessed using the Forced Swim Test, a method to study depression in rodents (22). In this test, development of depression is indicated by 1) increased immobility and 2) increased swimming time (22). Mice that were exposed to early maternal separation exhibited higher depression-like behavior, which triggered the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (8). To measure the effects of probiotics on cytokines levels, the study administered </span><i><span>Bifidobacteria infantis</span></i><span> to depressed mice, then compared it to a group treated with Citalopram, an antidepressant (8). After chronic probiotic treatment, decreased immobility in the Forced Swim Test and restoration of pro-inflammatory cytokines levels were observed with effects comparable to Citalopram (8). </span>

<b>Neurotransmitters</b>

<i><span>Serotonin </span></i>

<span>The monoamine hypothesis is the most accepted model for pathogenesis of depression (23). It states that depression is caused by deficiency in neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which have been major targets for most antidepressants (23). A study by Wikoff et al. tested a possible mechanism by which gut microbiome modulation influences serotonin levels in germ-free mice (24). The introduction of microbiome increased plasma serotonin levels </span><span>2.8 fold (24).</span> <span>This increase may be attributed to the regulatory effects of microbiome on the serotonin that is usually stored in gut tissues upon birth (25). However, more studies are needed to determine the mechanism of release.</span>

<i><span>GABA</span></i>

<span>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a neurotransmitter involved in regulating the central nervous system (26). A reduction or an increase in GABA receptors is correlated with depression (26). To observe the effects of gut microbiome on GABA receptors and depression-like behavior, </span><i><span>Lactobacillus </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Bifidobacterium </span></i><span>bacterial strains were fed to two groups of stress-induced mice (27). The first group was only stress-induced, while the second group was stress-induced and vagotomized, which refers to cutting part or all of the vagus nerve (27). The first group had altered GABA receptor expression and reduced depression-like behavior after probiotics administration as observed using the Forced Swim Test (27).</span> <span>The vagotomized mice, however, did not exhibit the same effects (27). This suggests that the vagus nerve is a possible way of interaction between the brain and the gut microbiome (27). This study did not use germ-free mice or mice with modified gut microbiome, which makes it more applicable to free-living mammals, including humans (27).</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span>This review investigated possible pathways by which the microbiome affects depression status in mice. Such pathways involve the HPA axis, cytokines, serotonin, and GABA. The findings can be utilized to develop medications specifically targeting depression markers in the gut or to further investigate the possible antidepressant properties of probiotics, which can be included in parallel with standard depression therapy. More studies on this topic are necessary to understand how these pathways relate to the etiology of depression in humans.</span>

<b>Author's Note:</b><span> I wrote this literature review for my UWP 104F class, and I specifically chose this topic because obesity is a very stigmatized disorder or “disease” (as the AAMC recently labeled it). I wanted to explore the link to genetics and to see how thoroughly we understand the underlying causes of obesity, specifically in children. Further, the judgement of both the children and the children’s parents has brought up a conversation about whether or not it is okay to place a child into foster care for treatment of obesity, due to lack of care by the parents. Initially, research into foster care seemed out of place in this paper. However, I think it’s an interesting way to combine the scientific advancements outlined in this review paper with the social contentions surrounding obesity. I hope the reader will come away with a more thorough understanding of the complexity of the disease based on the link to genetics.</span>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span>Pediatric obesity is a serious disease affecting American children and adolescents.  According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), one in every six children is affected by pediatric obesity. The CDC defines obesity as having a body mass index (BMI) in the 95</span><span>th</span><span> percentile of children with the same age and sex, while morbid pediatric obesity is considered as having a BMI in the 99</span><span>th</span><span> percentile.</span><span>1</span><span> Various causes of obesity have been identified, including environmental factors such as diet, level of sedentary lifestyle, and parental BMI. Recently, genetic links to pediatric obesity have been identified and studied. Many genes, including portions of the FTO gene (fat mass and obesity-associated) and 3q29 (a section of DNA on chromosome 3), have been shown to be strongly linked.</span><span>3,4</span><span> Other genes, which were believed to be linked to appetite, have been shown to have no causation with obesity. It is interesting to consider this data in the context of foster care. New studies gathering data from a large sample size of adolescents in foster care have interesting findings. Consideration of this data is important in the discussion of whether or not foster care is an effective treatment option for pediatric obesity. While foster care is not a conventional treatment for obesity, it can be considered in cases where parents are showing neglect. </span>

<span>This review will outline various findings concerning the link between pediatric obesity and genetics. This involves examining studies which suggest a link between genetics and obesity, and also studies which show no causation for a certain gene. Further investigations will be done on publications which outline the changes in BMI after children have entered foster care and the implications of these findings on the causes of pediatric obesity.</span>

<b>Genetic Links</b>

<i><span>FTO and MC4R</span></i>

<span>Throughout the past five years, many studies have shown strong genetic links to pediatric obesity. One of these genes is the fat mass and obesity-associated gene, or FTO gene. In one previous publication, researchers utilized a cross-sectional study of over 16,000 children to search for a statistical association between FTO variant rs9939609, total macronutrient intake, and the subsequent effect on BMI.</span><span>4</span><span> They found that this particular FTO variant is predictive of both a high BMI and an associated higher nutrient intake.</span><span>4</span><span>  The FTO gene codes for fat mass and obesity-associated protein, which is important in breaking down dietary fats.</span><span>4</span><span> Another research group had a similar question about the FTO gene and variant rs9939609, except they approached the data analysis differently. Rather than looking at whether or not genetic variations modified fat intake, they examined whether or not an increase in macronutrient intake increased the gene’s expression.</span><span>2</span><span> Their findings show that a higher fat intake of an individual increased the activity of the FTO variant.</span><span>2</span><span> The gene expresses itself in a positive feedback manner because the FTO variant rs993609 is predictive of a higher BMI and higher nutrient intake. Further, higher macronutrient intake leads to a higher expression of this variant. This variant has a correlation with and effect on pediatric obesity.</span><span>4</span><span>  </span>

<span>Another closely related study looked at the ability of carriers of the FTO GG (a certain genotype of the FTO gene) and/or MC4R CC (melanocortin 4 receptor) gene to lose weight. In order to examine this, researchers screened a large population of obese children and studied those with varying levels of the protein Lp-PLA2, which is the product of FTO GG and/or MC4R CC.</span><span>3</span><span> Obese carriers of these genes were statistically able to lose significantly more weight than non-carriers.</span><span>3</span><span> Certain variants of the FTO gene are associated with weight loss, while others are associated with a higher BMI and a higher fat intake. Both indicate a link between pediatric obesity and genetic factors.</span>

<i><span>Prader-Willi Syndrome and MO1 Syndrome</span></i>

<span>Other genetic variants include copy number variants of 3q29 and syndromic, where the patient is showing symptoms (15q11.2 deletions, Prader-Willi syndrome) and non-syndromic (16p11.2 deletion).</span><span>5.6</span><span> A copy number variant is when a portion of the genome is repeated at a different rate than the rest of the population, thus leading to a different number of repeats in the genome of the variant. Prader-Willi syndrome and a deletion of 16p11.2 have been shown to be linked to pediatric obesity, although they are rare deletions.</span><span>5</span><span> Researchers were wondering how significant the relation between rare copy number variants and  pediatric obesity was, so they genetically tested a group of pediatric obese patients versus healthy-weight pediatric patients.</span><span>5</span><span> They found many copy number variants in the obese subject group and concluded that copy number variants statistically contribute to a substantial amount of pediatric obesity cases.</span><span>5</span>

<span>Other researchers investigated an Arab-Israeli family living in northern Israel. In the family there were 15 obese patients with 31 unaffected, relatively healthy family members. Despite growing up in a very similar environment, with comparable diets and exercise levels, 33% of the family faced obesity with associated glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia (elevated fats and cholesterol in the blood), and insulin resistance.</span><span>6</span><span> While this was not a specific study on pediatric obesity, all affected family members developed childhood obesity by age 3.</span><span>6</span><span> The researchers genetically screened every member of the family and found that all affected by obesity were missing the gene coding for CEP19.</span><span>6</span><span> They verified these results with knockout mice for the same gene. The mice were found to be morbidly obese, glucose intolerant, and insulin resistant, and they also had  a notably increased appetite.</span><span>6</span><span> A wide variety of genetic variations, including mutations, deletions, or insertions, can contribute to the spread of pediatric obesity. Many genes have been investigated and are thought to affect obesity; however, it is important to discuss studies that show no correlations between genetics and obesity.  </span>

<b>Genetics with no causation</b>

<span>While there are many genes which are now thought to be connected to obesity, many have been thoroughly studied and shown to have little relation to obesity. Certain genes which have been linked to appetite were studied to find a link to higher BMI. Genes which code for proteins called Neuropeptide Y and Neuropeptide receptor 2 (NPY and NPY2R, respectively) have been shown to have a positive effect on the appetite of an individual. Since there was a connection to appetite, researchers hypothesized that it may further have an effect on obesity. Adolescents with varying BMIs up to age 14 were screened for overexpression of the previously-mentioned genes and also for genetic variations. This study found no significant variants of NPY2R and some minor variants of NPY, but both these genes were overall found to have no significant contribution to the obese population.</span><span>7</span><span> It is notable to discuss that genes linked to appetite can still be secondarily linked to obesity, even if their expressions can’t be linked to BMI directly. Another study screened for variants of the SH2B1 gene, a gene which codes for a protein which interacts with insulin receptors. The study was broad, and included a large percentage of the Belgian adolescent population. While many variants of the gene were found between healthy and obese subjects, no causation was identified between variants and obesity.</span><span>8</span><span> Researchers do conclude that while causation cannot be statistically verified, it can also not be entirely ruled out.</span><span>8</span><span> In another study on adult Americans, researchers </span><i><span>did</span></i><span> find a link between SH2B1 and obesity.</span><span>11</span><span> A notable difference between the studies was the age. In Belgium, researchers looked at only adolescents, while the study in America looked only at adults. The juxtaposition of these findings highlight how far we are from a full understanding of this disease and its various causes.</span>

<b>Foster Care</b>

<i><span>Now that we have examined the link between genetics and obesity, we will examine data connecting foster care and obesity. This is interesting data to analyze for multiple reasons. </span></i>

<i><span>Foster care as a treatment for pediatric obesity is currently a heavily-debated, controversial topic. Furthermore, foster care is a dramatic change in a child’s environment. Because of this, we can analyze this data in the context of genetic factors versus environmental factors having an effect on obesity. </span></i>

<span>There is currently some debate among experts about whether or not foster care is an appropriate option for children who suffer from pediatric obesity, particularly those with morbid obesity. This stems from the idea that parents of obese children do not provide sufficient care by either over-feeding their children or not providing regular, healthy meals. Case studies, where an obese or morbidly obese child is placed into foster care and their weight is studied, are common in this field. A recent study mapped the weight fluctuations of 360 children who were placed into foster care. In children aged 2-5 years, there was a significantly lowered BMI after entering into foster care. However, no significant total change was found across all ages.</span><span>9</span><span> Another similar study compared the BMIs of foster children to standardized normal BMIs in the general population. It was found that children in foster care were more likely to have a higher BMI than children who were not in foster care.</span><span>10</span><span> Foster care has positive and negative effects on each individual child. However, in evaluating a large sample size of children within the foster care system, foster care may not be helpful in treating pediatric obesity and could potentially be contributing to the prevalence of the disease. These findings qualify the previous discussion on pediatric obesity and genetics, as altering a child’s environment does not appear to reduce their BMI and may even lead to an increase in BMI. </span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span>While pediatric obesity can have many causes, recent studies have shown a link between genetics and this disease. These findings are particularly interesting in the context of discussing foster care as a treatment option for pediatric obesity. Data suggests that changing a child’s environment by placing them into foster care may have little beneficial effects on pediatric obesity and can even contribute to the disease. Physicians’ current treatment plans for obesity involve recommending lifestyle changes; however, environmental changes will not alter phenotypic effects. With an understanding of the underlying genetic causation, further research could be done on the efficacy of treatment plans for pediatric obesity. Re-evaluation of current treatment plans for pediatric obesity appears important, considering the recent findings about various causes of pediatric obesity.</span>

<b>Author's Note: </b><span>I wrote this literature review for my UWP 104F class in my fourth year at UC Davis. My goal is to become a physical therapist and one of the most common complaints I hear from older generations is that they cannot perform activities they once loved because of a ‘bad back.’ My father experienced a disc related injury, which led to sciatica, after he fell off a ladder. This prevents him from enjoying activities such as heavy-lifting, riding roller coasters or picking up his grandson. For these reasons, I was interested in researching effective prevention and treatments to help alleviate discomfort and improve quality of life.</span>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span>A disc herniation is one of the most common injuries leading to chronic low back pain and disability. At some point in their lives, approximately 84% of adults experience low back pain, causing this to be a significant universal healthcare concern [1]. A herniated disc is a problem in which the nucleus pulposus or annulus fibrosis of intervertebral discs are pushed out beyond allowable disc space [2]. Herniation may produce an agonizing condition known as sciatica, radicular pain throughout the sciatic nerve [3]. The resulting chronic pain can become debilitating and a socioeconomic difficulty correlative to discomfort severity, necessary treatment and psychological or social consequences. According to Andersson et al., as cited by Khan et al., “The direct and indirect costs associated with LBP in the United States are estimated to be upwards of $100–200 billion per year, more than half of which is due to loss of income and lack of productivity” [1]. These disabling symptoms which threaten the quality of life, call for more effective treatments and therapies to alleviate pain and prevent the condition from progressing. </span>

<span>Healthcare providers often suggest surgery, such as discectomy, to treat the cause of intractable pain. However, surgeries cannot completely cure the disability and the positive outcomes experienced by expensive and risky surgeries may only be temporary [4]. There are alternative treatments that may alleviate symptoms, such as exercise therapies and epidural steroid injections. Advantages of nonsurgical treatments include long-lasting benefits for some patients without the risk of potential damage to nerves, less postoperative pain, and decreased time away from work [5].</span><span> Although there are some negative outcomes, there is significant research on various surgical treatments and the short-term effects. However, research comparing the long term efficaciousness of nonsurgical options to surgery is negligible. This could partly be due to the difficulty of conducting a valid study where human nature is concerned. Patients assigned to stretching, exercise and pain medication, are less likely to remain compliant, and at any point during the study they may request surgery.</span>

<span> The purpose of this literature review is to analyze a variety of research studies regarding  treatments, and discuss the long term outcomes. This review additionally examines and contrasts nonsurgical and surgical intervention, with the goal of discovering and emphasizing the need for alternative care for symptom relief.</span>

<b>Results/Analysis</b>

<i><span>Anatomy and Potential Causes </span></i>

<span>The spine is composed of intervertebral discs which are made of soft connective tissue, and function in shock absorbing, spinal flexibility and providing rigidity to the skeleton while allowing limited rotation and bending [1,6]. The center of an intervertebral disc consists of the nucleus pulposus, which is a gelatinous core, and the outer annulus fibrosis, which maintains disc structure [6,7]. Herniated discs can be caused by repetitive overuse, age related deterioration of discs, or a traumatic injury [6]. Degenerative changes occur with age as the discs dry out and crack with overuse and repeated irritation [1]. Studies have shown that most herniations occur when there is a rotational or compressive force applied while the back is in an anterolateral flexion position, resulting in bulging and slippage of the nucleus pulposus in the posterolateral direction [6]. This means that there is strain on the annulus fibrosis and pressure on the nucleus pulposus as it moves in the opposite direction of bend. </span><span>Sciatica becomes a symptom of disc herniation once extrusion of the disc exerts force on the sciatic nerve roots [3]. </span>

<i><span>Physical Activity vs. Surgery</span></i>

<span>Physical therapy programs encompass trunk and core strengthening, improved lumbosacral flexibility and low impact aerobic activity [7,8]. These methods increase stability and alleviate tension on the spine, thereby resulting in less pain or risk of long term disability [7]. Elnaggar et al. evaluated the efficiency of spinal flexion and extension exercises by instructing participants to perform these movements each day [9]. Researchers concluded that extension exercise was the most effective in reducing pain but that these differences could be attributed to variables such as patient age and initial severity of pain [9]. </span>

<span>Daily living requires an extensive range of motions such as rotation and side bending, so the addition of a yoga program may have long-term beneficial effects. In a study by Tilbrook et al., individuals with low back pain were introduced to a yoga program that taught pain-relieving pose</span><span>s to strengthen weak areas of the body [10]. Although the participants did not report any pain reduction, they did enjoy an improved ability to perform everyday activities [10]. Takaki et al. discussed the importance of posture attention during exercises [11]. If a patient had excessive tilting of the pelvis, this may promote extension of the lower back, leading to compression of the vertebrae [11]. To correct their posture, strengthening the abdominal muscles assisted in tilting the pelvis posteriorly, consequently reducing lower back pain [11]. Emphasizing awareness of posture may lessen stress on the spine and prevent further injury.</span>

<span>Surgical interventions are often used when there are continuous nerve root symptoms [12]. Of the various surgical options, discectomy is the “most frequent lumbar spine operation in the US,” involving removal of the disc that is pressing on the nerve root [13]. One study treated patients suffering from sciatica resulting from disc herniation with surgery or nonsurgical methods [13]. A ten-year follow up found that the magnitude of improvement in leg pain for surgically treated patients was greater than that of the nonsurgically treated, however, there was no difference in improvement in disability between the two groups [13].</span>

<span> In research conducted by Weinstein et al., </span><span>self-reported measurements of pain and physical function scales were utilized to compare the effectiveness of surgery to non-surgical interventions for patients with lumbar disk herniation [14]. Participants underwent surgery, or received non surgical treatment, such as physical therapy, education and counseling, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotic analgesic agents, or epidural injections. While both groups reported improvement in physical function and pain at three months, the surgical patients had more immediate and greater pain relief. Between three months and two years, the pain relief in the non surgical group was close to that of the patients receiving surgery. However, it appears that the patients who chose surgical intervention reported greater overall improvement than those who elected nonoperative care [14].</span>

<span>In an additional comparison of the two treatment options, the SPORT research trial, also concluded that early surgery may have a major advantage in faster relief of pain, quicker recovery, and return to work [14]. For those who are not surgical candidates, the alternative methods of care prove to be almost as effective as surgery following one year of treatment [14]. Long-term physical therapy and exercise are associated with decreased need for sick leave and a higher rate of return to work [8]. The results suggest that participants who utilize physical activity find their pain more manageable [14]. Findings by Weinstein et al. regarding patient reported satisfaction of surgical versus non surgical intervention appear contradictory [14]. On closer examination, Weinstein’s use of the word, manageable, with regard to the non surgical group, implies that this group benefited by learning coping mechanisms thereby leading to a more favorable perception of their pain level. </span>

<i><span>Epidural Injections vs Surgery</span></i>

<span>Epidural steroid injection is another viable option for controlling back pain due to disc herniation. Although it is one of the most popular and minimally invasive treatments, there is mixed research as to its efficacy. In a study by Manchikanti et al., 120 patients diagnosed with disc herniation or radiculitis, a nerve root disease, either received epidural injections with a local anesthetic or steroid [15]. The steroid injected patients report of superior pain relief  demonstrates that steroids, in contrast to local anesthetics, have greater results in pain reduction [15]. The authors in Winkelstein et al. discuss increased interest in epidural administration of immunosuppressants, the results of which point to an inflammatory response [16].These findings regarding the role of inflammation and immune response in triggering pain are a promising option for future research.</span>

<span>A three-year study, by</span><span> Buttermann, sought to compare the use of epidural steroid injection vs surgery for the relief of herniated disc pain [4]. The results showed a decrease in pain and an increase in function in both groups, but 31% of the epidurals had little success [4]. In conclusion, compared to  epidural steroid injection, discectomy is more effective in reducing symptoms and disability [4].</span>

<i><span>Future Interventions</span></i>

<span>Stem cell research towards regeneration of intervertebral discs is an exciting addition to an area of healthcare that has, as yet, seen little progress towards a permanent solution. The ability of a tissue to respond to stress or injury requires the involvement and function of stem cells resident in tissue-specific microenvironmental niches [17]. Investigations have found that a stem cell system is present in the intervertebral disc and aging has been shown to result in its decrease as well as the loss of the ability to maintain homeostasis and regenerate tissue function [17].</span>

<span>Although animal studies and preliminary human trials have supported the future of stem cell therapy for disc diseases, </span><span>careful application of cells and techniques</span><span> in a strictly controlled manner is key in ensuring safety. An example was given in which cell leakage was reported after MSC (mesenchymal stem cells) injection into the intervertebral disc [17]. This can cause osteophyte formation, potentially leading to nerve impingement [17]. There is optimism that stem cells can facilitate intervertebral disc tissue engineering and repair, but in our zeal for a promising restoration we cannot afford to cause harm. While there is considerable potential for the therapeutic use of stem cells in intervertebral disc degeneration, more research is necessary. The presumption is that it will be many years before stem cell therapy becomes a mainstream solution. </span>

<b>Discussion</b>

<span>There are various research articles discussing the benefits of physical therapy and exercise in the treatment of chronic low back pain due to disc herniation. Core stabilization, recovering coordination, and flexibility through yoga also improves pain levels, decreases the risks of long-term disability and assists patients in returning to their daily routine. The exercises, however, must be demonstrated accurately by a professional who has the knowledge of biomechanics and is capable of ensuring that the patient performs the exercises correctly. </span>

<span> Epidural steroid injections may alleviate pain and enhance function, but do not cure the underlying cause of pain. An interesting future study may be to seek a method of predicting which patients will benefit from an epidural steroid injection. There is no substantial evidence that surgical treatments result in superior pain relief long term.  Nor is there evidence that surgery can fully treat disc herniation.</span><span> Surgery is the most effective treatment for immediate relief of herniated discs, but further research in regards to alternative therapy is anticipated. </span><span>There are promising studies in the field of stem cell transplants with the potential for regeneration of intervertebral discs. However, chronic low back pain perseveres as one of the most socioeconomically and life debilitating conditions. As such, it requires further research regarding alternative treatment options. Patients require therapy that, not only alleviates, but heals the cause and root of back pain in the intervertebral discs, controls symptoms such as pain and sciatica, and prevents damage or loss of function.</span>

<b>Author's Note: </b><span>When I found out that CRISPR was used for the first time on human embryos that were fully brought to term, I was pretty surprised that such a new technology with numerous unknowns was being used on the germline. I was interested in understanding the reasoning for such an experiment and what may come out of it in the long run. To some, CRISPR may seem like a far off technology that could be applied to humans in the distant future. However, the experiment on the twin fetuses that went through this “genetic surgery” proves that CRISPR is happening now and is likely to stay.  </span>

<b>But first, how does CRISPR work?</b>

<span>CRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a genome editing technology that is cheaper, faster, more accurate, and more efficient than other existing genome editing methods [1]. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was initially adapted from the prokaryotic defense system, where CRISPRs are found in both archaea and bacteria [5]. CRISPR arrays serve as an integral part of the immune system by consisting of repeating sequences of genetic code which are interrupted by “spacer” sequences — residues of genetic code from previously attacking bacteriophages [1,5]. When the viruses attack again, the bacteria transcribe CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) from the “spacer” regions in the CRISPR arrays to latch onto the viral DNA, where Cas9 —  an enzyme that recognizes the crRNA — will cut the DNA, causing the knockout to cease the progression of the attack [5].</span>

<span>In the lab, the CRISPR system works in a similar manner. Researchers can also utilize various other enzymes to cleave the unwanted DNA, one such being Cpf1. Where CRISPR-Cas9 would produce blunt ends — a complex where the DNA is cut at the same location on each strand — CRISPR-Cpf1 cuts DNA at different locations, thus creating short single-stranded overhangs [5]. These overhangs, otherwise called sticky ends, can help make the insertion of new DNA more stringent, accurate, and of the correct orientation. Various enzymes also recognize different areas on the DNA; this differentiation allows researchers to allocate enzymes to their area of study [5]. Once the DNA is cut, segments of interest can be inserted or deleted by using the cell’s mechanism of homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous-end joining (NHEJ) [1, 6]. </span>

<span>Scientists hope to expand their findings pertaining to CRISPR on a variety of issues, especially single-gene disorders such as hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell disease. In the long term, CRISPR also shows promise in preventing or treating cancer, heart disease, mental illness, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [1]. However, these findings and advancements in application come with various ethical concerns. As of now, most changes introduced with genome editing are limited to somatic cells. This ensures that changes are restricted to few tissues and cannot be passed down from one generation to another; however, changes made to germline cells, or even to embryos, can be passed down to future generations. Since this area is still relatively new and unknown, there is not yet enough information about the accuracy and long-lasting impact. Off-target effects could prove disastrous as there would be an entirely new set of unforeseen consequences. Moreover, even at the right target, genes interact in a complicated matter; changes at one site could have implications in a completely different area. Multiple unknowns coupled with long term consequences led to a tremendous outcry after it was revealed that two twin girls were born after having changes made at their embryonic stage. </span>

<b>The Trial  </b>

<span>While He Jiankui has not published a paper describing the methodology and details on his experiment, he released a promotional video for his study on The He Lab YouTube channel on November 25, 2018. He describes how because “Mark” is HIV positive, he and his wife “Grace” were concerned that their children would potentially be positive as well [2]. This made them viable candidates for the experiment. He Jiankui mentions that along with fertilizing Grace’s egg with Mark’s sperm, the researchers also “sent a little bit of protein and instructions” that would do a “gene surgery” to remove the doorway in which HIV enters to “infect people” [2].  In the video, He claims that the team considered the surgery to be a success, as confirmed by genome sequencing [2]. Lastly, twin embryos were implanted via regular IVF “with one difference” [2]. </span>

<span>This resulted in the first “CRISPR babies”: “Lulu” and “Nana.” He acknowledges that his actions will spark unparalleled controversy; however, he describes this path as no different than when in vitro fertilization (IVF) was first used to create Louise Joy Brown in 1977.</span> <span>According to the limited information published in Shenzhen HOME Women's and Children’s Hospital ethics committee review application, mouse and monkey models were initially used to conduct “rigorous” early-test studies for the </span><i><span>CCR5 </span></i><span>gene since it serves as a receptor that the latches onto a white blood cell [3, 4, 7].</span>

<span>The next step was embryos of model organisms similar to humans were examined after going through CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing [3]. Genetically edited embryonic stem cells were isolated to determine if they abnormally propagated and whether they differentiated after genetic testing [3]. To address off-target effects, two methods were used. Firstly, using high-fidelity Cas9 enzymes, He was able increase stringency and reduce off target effects [3]. Secondly, the best single guide RNA (sgRNA) was selected for which consists of the crRNA fused to the scaffold tracrRNA sequence that Cas nuclease binds to [7]. Using these critical steps, the</span><i><span> CCR5 </span></i><span>region was able to be deleted. </span>

<b>What is Next?</b>

<span>According to the Associated Press, He altered the embryos of seven couples, with the birth of only Lulu and Nana so far [9, 10]. In every case, the father was infected with the disease, and the mother was HIV-negative. He’s goal was to introduce an uncommon, natural genetic variation that would make it difficult for HIV to infect white blood cells [8]. By deleting the receptor, the apparent intent was not to reduce the chance of transmission from the father, since the likelihood naturally decreases when the sperm is washed before insemination during IVF. Rather, He stated that he wanted to reduce the chance of infection later on in life [8]. While He claims that he is against gene editing for enhancement purposes and that it should only be used for therapy, many question whether his actions prove hypocritical [2].  Many assert that He’s actions suggest that being born HIV susceptible is a disease state; however, common sense tells indicates otherwise, and that the lengths that He went through to reduce HIV susceptibility are not medically justified [8, 9]. </span>

<span>The limited information suggests that He’s editing was incomplete, and that one of the twins is mosaic [9]. This would mean that only some cells have the silenced </span><i><span>CCR5</span></i><span> gene, thus indicating that there is a significant likelihood that she would not be protected from HIV [9, 10]. Even with a successful deletion all around, certain strains of HIV can still enter cells through CXCR4, a protein [9]. When geneticists first identified people with a natural genetic variation consisting of non-working copies of </span><i><span>CCR5, </span></i><span>it was thought that they would be resistant to HIV without any repercussions [9].  However, later studies showed that deficiency in </span><i><span>CCR5</span></i><span> meant that people were more susceptible to infections like West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, and more likely to die from influenza [9, 11]. While CRISPR can help spearhead numerous medical advancements, there is no doubt that many unknowns remain. Unintended consequences that the twins and other potential children of this study could face would prove that the progression of CRISPR applications for humans, especially for embryos, is premature. </span>

<span><strong>Author's Note:</strong> </span><span>I wrote this case study for my writing in health sciences class since allergies are a growing epidemic in the developed world. Due to the prevalence of this chronic chronic condition, food contamination is health concern for those prone to acute allergic reactions. However, little is known about the etiology of immune system dysfunction and many patients are unable to receive a concrete diagnosis. I chose to interview my friend to get a glimpse into what it’s like to manage this chronic condition and to learn more about the potential causes and treatments.</span>

<!--more-->

<span>X* had her first allergic reaction at the age of two after eating a pack of Ritz crackers. </span>

<span>Within an hour, she started crying and became covered in hives. Thinking that their daughter was on the verge of suffocation, her parents rushed her to the emergency room, where the doctors were able to stop what turned out to be her first allergic reaction. </span>

<span>X’s parents did not have a reason to read the allergen warning on the Ritz pack. Her diagnosis, peanut allergies, bewildered her parents. In their Asian home country, the condition was not widely recognized. Peanut oil, a common ingredient in traditional Asian dishes, had never caused allergies in her family. </span><span>X’s parents did not have a history of allergies, nor did they expose X to an excess of peanuts as a baby. Little information was available about the cause and management of allergies in the early 2000s when X was first diagnosed; according to the U.S. clinical allergy management guidelines claimed, environmental exposure to peanuts and peanut oil during infancy positively correlates to allergy development later in life [1]. Current research suggest that peanut proteins can activate the immune system and trigger the development of peanut-specific antibodies [2]. When the body detects the presence of an allergen, a supply of antibodies is ready attack the antigens, such as peanut proteins. However, the immune system has to be sensitized or develop antibodies to the allergen before the first allergic reaction. The first exposure does not elicit an immune response--instead it mediates the production of antibodies that are readily released upon the second exposure. Infants usually receive their first exposure in the womb or through breast milk. This logic did not fit X’s case since her mom avoided peanuts when she was pregnant to prevent the weight gain associated with peanut consumption. With no research hospital in the area, the doctors could not determine the cause of her allergies. There were no immediate treatments available apart from strict avoidance of allergen-containing foods and a prescription of </span><span>EpiPen </span><span>auto injectors with a dose of life-saving epinephrine to prevent anaphylaxis. EpiPen becomes useful when a patient accidentally consumes an allergen and enters anaphylaxis--an acute allergic reaction that results in a systemic drop of blood pressure and constriction of the airways. If left untreated, anaphylaxis can be fatal. Delivery of epinephrine relaxes the muscles, dilates the airways, and increases heart rate to restore blood circulation. EpiPen has saved X from these detrimental consequences on a few occasions. </span>

<span>When X entered primary school, her mom rigorously managed her diet. X could never eat at the school cafeteria or consume processed foods in case of a peanut contamination. This resulted in conflicts between mother and daughter, especially when X could not share snacks with friends or go trick-or-treating on Halloween. </span>

<span>Until high school, X had been successfully avoiding peanuts, but she continued experiencing rashes and injecting herself with EpiPen. After further skin prick testing, X was diagnosed with allergies to soy, milk, and eggs. Her doctors realized that </span><span>she became progressively sensitized to more allergens</span><span> since her initial diagnosis </span><span>[3]. X’s blood work also showed abnormally high levels of IgE antibodies, which</span><span> normally defend the body against parasites. In developed countries, where the environment is artificially disinfected, IgE antibodies </span><span>cross-react with proteins in food or pollen that are analogous to those in parasitic microorganisms [4]. Over time, IgE antibodies develop memory and contribute to a stronger response with repeated allergen contact </span><span>[5]. Since X’s symptoms were worsening, she was prescribed weekly injections of IgE inhibitors, which eased her dietary restrictions. X was now able to eat at restaurants and not worry about traces of peanuts. </span>

<span>While most products have allergen warnings in the United States, X found it difficult to find information on the presence of peanuts in Asia. For instance, instead of having a soup at a restaurant that may have contained peanut oil, X resorted to a sandwich that had a hidden layer of peanut butter. After one bite, she was on the verge of anaphylaxis. She immediately injected her thigh with the EpiPen and went to the hospital. When X explained her symptoms to the hospital staff, they were unsure of the definition of peanut allergies. The emergency room doctors were powerless and X left the hospital receiving little treatment. Thankfully, a 0.3-milligram dose of epinephrine from her EpiPen was enough to keep her safe and prevent the rash from coming back. Although food allergies are uncommon in Asia, the incidence rates in urbanized cities are almost comparable to the Western world [6]. The Asian healthcare system does not have delineated guidelines for treating allergies and there is a lack of awareness and appropriate testing.  However, the rates of autoimmune disorders in developing nations remain low, possibly due to the high prevalence of parasitic infections that prevent IgE antibodies from cross-reacting with food [7]. After this life-threatening event, X avoids traveling to Asia or countries that do not have stringent food labeling guidelines.</span>

<span>X also faced problems with food labeling during her first weeks of college as a freshman. While the dining hall had allergy warnings, the facility still processed nuts and did not place lids on peanut butter. X had to frequently use her EpiPen before learning how to avoid certain serving stations. Unfortunately, cross-contamination is not uncommon at public food facilities. One such example is a tragic death of a 10-year-old girl, who entered anaphylaxis after eating at a school cafeteria. When she reported experiencing asthma-like symptoms, it was too late to administer the EpiPen before her heart stopped. This tragedy led to legislature that now requires all Canadian schools to reduce exposure to allergens and train staff on prevention measures [8]. While the United States has similar laws, they are not as stringent and apply to only a few states. There is no information available if colleges comply with similar regulations. </span>

<span>The United States’ guidelines for allergy management changed in 2016. In early 2000s clinicians recommended delaying the introduction of peanuts to a minimum of 3 years of age even though no clinical studies have been conducted to support this recommendation  [9]. In fact, complete avoidance may have exacerbated X’s condition and overall contributed to the increased prevalence of allergies in the recent decades [10]. Evidence suggests that exposing at-risk infants to small doses of peanuts earlier in life decreases fatal allergy episodes compared to avoidance [11]. Studies from Israel show that infants have a ten-fold lower risk of developing allergies if their mothers consistently consume peanuts during pregnancy [12]. This may explain why X is so sensitive to peanuts—her mom avoided peanuts when she was pregnant. </span>

<span>Research has led to the development of the next generation treatment that is currently in Phase III clinical trials. DBV Technologies created Viaskin, a skin patch that is saturated with peanut allergens. The antigens from the patch penetrate through the skin and safely travel to the lymph nodes, avoiding the bloodstream. Prolonged exposure to the allergen may desensitize the immune system or build tolerance, thereby improving the condition management. The long-term studies have shown a 99% decrease in life-threatening reactions from an accidental allergen exposure [13]. A placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial is currently enrolling participants at a research center near X’s house. </span>

<span>X plans to either enroll in the Viaskin study or become a research assistant for the clinical trial after she graduates from college. After hearing that her allergic friend has a patch and can safely eat 16 peanuts, gives X hope that she can become allergy-free after more than two decades of fighting her condition.</span>

<b>Author's Note:</b><span> Like everyone else, I love music- especially the works of my favorite artists. There is nothing better than listening or jamming out to your favorite song. The human love for music is a powerful binding force, but why do we even like it? What are the underlying physiological responses of our enjoyment? I wanted to explore the functions of our brain as they relate to enjoying music, and found some interesting results about what scientists have uncovered thus far.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>One of the most distinguishing characteristics of the human brain is the ability to interpret and feel emotions regarding complex environmental stimuli such as visual arts and music. Even more interesting is the seemingly infinite amount of variation in how each individual perceives these stimuli, or rather, the reason why one person may love to listen to Vampire Weekend while another casually listens to a lo-fi playlist. There are structural similarities shared by all humans, crafted over millions of years of evolution, but they do not account for different tastes. Neuroscientists who study dopaminergic pathways and other neural structural mechanisms have made several initial steps in understanding what physiological functions music serves to humans. So far, it has been established that musical appreciation and preference are related to the connectivity of white matter between regions in the auditory cortex and the regions processing emotion; variations in activity from neurons related to emotional communication could explain our differences in musical taste. Answering questions about the effects of music on the brain will undoubtedly help to answer larger questions about music’s evolutionary purpose and its profound impact on human cultures. </span>

<b>Neuroscience of Pleasure and Reward</b>

<span>Motivation, emotion, and arousal can all be attributed to elevated activity in the reward centers of the brain. As these traits are known to have implications in addiction, their cellular manifestations have been studied for several decades. The ventral striatum, midbrain, amygdala, and some areas of the prefrontal cortex have all been demonstrated, in varying degrees, to being recruited in instances of drug use. The dopaminergic pathways of the brain refer to a series of densely-packed neuronal connections that are stimulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine to propagate signals. Collectively, these regions of the brain are responsible for our response to natural stimuli and our actions to either seek or avoid them. </span>

<span>The brain’s reward centers are also known to be active in communal interactions, suggesting that there is a benefit to acting in a socially-positive way. Interestingly, the emotions experienced by humans when listening to their favorite music is correlated to the engagement of the same dopaminergic pathways as those that are stimulated during drug use or social interactions. It is important to note that the similarities between which parts of the brain are engaged when listening to music, using drugs, or being with people do not imply that the physiological or psychological effects are closely mimicked in the process. Neurons communicate via action potentials. These synaptic changes in membrane voltage effectively signal messages to neighboring neurons, but nothing about them is inherently meaningful. Since all action potentials are the same, it is the frequency of their appearances that convey messages. As it relates to the similarities in regions activated by both drug use and music, increases in activity do not necessarily equal the same frequencies of action potentials. Nonetheless, positron emission tomography (PET) scans observing pleasurable responses to music in animals and humans show the same regions of the brain being activated. Increases in dopaminergic pathway activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral pallidum, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, hippocampus, and other areas of the midbrain collectively correlate to the reward process [3]. </span>

<b>The Brain’s Response to Music</b>

<span>There are several experiments that examine the neural response to music, or “aesthetic responses” as some scientific literature has described. PET studies visualized the neural relationship with ‘intensely pleasurable’ responses to music [2]. Intensely pleasurable responses are defined as euphoric sensations in reaction to music, characterized by “shivers-down-the-spine” or “chills” [1]. In addition to observing activity levels within the brain, researchers monitored heart rate and blood flow in the brain. When excited by external stimuli, the central nervous system commands a response throughout the body to heighten the senses and increase awareness. A study by Blood et al. measured heart rate and cerebral blood flow of subjects listening to chill-inducing songs. Increases in the intensity of stimulation from a song were shown to increase blood flow in areas of the brain’s reward centers, as well as the heart rate. It is known that pleasure derived from music activates regions between the brain’s auditory region, specifically the superior temporal gyrus, and the reward centers such as the ventral and dorsal striatum. Parts of the basal ganglia, the ventral and dorsal striatum are largely responsible for motor function as it relates to desire and reward. Despite these findings, the exact connection between physiological sensations and aesthetic responses in the brain are ambiguous [1]. </span>

<b>Evolutionary Advantage?</b>

<span>The question of music’s evolutionary purpose has been postulated for over a century, including in Darwin’s </span><i><span>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</span></i><span> [3]. To some experts, music is considered to be the result of an evolutionary exaptation. That is, music’s purpose was not selected for its current use by humans. Rather, it came about as a result of excited neural pathways that engage emotional responses [1]. Others suggest that music is an important communicative tool that possibly preceded speech and language [5]. In this case, the chills elicited by music are physiologically measurable emotional responses, which signify that music is effectively a resource for communicating emotions [3].</span>

<span>Based on this idea, some researchers wanted to examine responses to music between individuals and compare them to the structural foundations of their emotional expressiveness capacity. Musical anhedonia is used to describe a condition for those who do not exhibit any pleasure from music, as there is no dopaminergic response from the reward centers. The flat affective response of individuals with this condition could be compared to the brains of subjects with affective responses to music. One such study found that patterns of white matter networks between the superior temporal gyrus through the ventral and dorsal striatum predicted the amount of reward response elicited by music. As the name suggests, the superior temporal gyrus is part of the temporal lobe- which is associated with the auditory cortex. This path of white matter moves from the auditory processing system to the basal ganglia. The aforementioned ventral and dorsal striatum, both parts of the basal ganglia, are involved in motor function. However, there could be other reward-related responses elicited from these structures, such as chills. Some researchers postulate that music may have had its origins from chill-responses to pleasurable sounds in the evolutionary environment, which may have motivated our ancestors to create their own response-evoking sounds [3]. Chills are viewed as a form of communication, demonstrating a positive response to sounds. Therefore, finding this white matter network may suggest that, in addition to emotion, there is a structural aspect of music involved in communication [3].</span>

<b>Music’s Effect on Other Species</b>

<span>A less studied and even less understood aspect of music is its meaning and interpretation by other species. Understanding the effect of music on other animals could provide a glimpse into music’s inherent biological meaning. Although it is clear that the pleasures that humans experience from music are not necessarily akin to the experience of animals, research suggests that music genres can affect the mood or behavior of captive animals. Country music has been shown to improve the mood and well-being of cattle, as opposed to more harsh or erratic-sounding music such as rock and jazz. One study specifically showed that cows more readily entered milking parlours when exposed to country music. However, these foundational animal studies have strictly been observant of the behavior and activity of the cattle [4]. Examining the neurological differences in musical preference or indifference in cattle would provide more concrete evidence of the neurological change that leads to the observed behaviors.</span>

<b>Further Discussions and Research</b>

<span>The research discussed thus far provides clues into the baseline purposes of music and the nature of its evolutionary impact. Yet, there are still many interesting existential discussion topics surrounding the origins of music and its purpose. Grounded biological inquiry, however, will be the most essential tool to get closer to understanding the extraordinary impact of music on human culture, communication, and evolution. Moving forward, researchers should continue to address the differences between individual preference and capacity to respond to music by studying differences in neural matter and structure. Most evidence suggests that music has a strong correlation to emotional expression, so examining the mechanisms of communication and interpreting abstract stimuli as emotional cues will help researchers understand how music can be physiologically deciphered and responded to. On a broader scale, examining global differences in musicality could provide insight into how different cultures and languages relate to their historically popular forms of music and rhythms. Could phonetic or rhythmic patterns in language correspond to preferences for certain tempos, measures, rhythms, or lyrics in music? These questions would be better served in a separate discussion but for now, go back to enjoying your favorite song.</span>

<span><strong>Author's Note:</strong> While browsing recent findings in </span><i><span>Neuroscience</span></i><span>, I came across research investigating the possible conversion of glia to neurons. Although the conventional idea that neurons are irreplaceable has been overturned in multiple research studies, I was immediately intrigued by the possibility for neighboring glia to be the source of neural regeneration. The implications of this research could completely transform how treatment is approached in the neuroscience field of medicine.</span>

<!--more-->

<span>The trademark of neural cells is their inability to regenerate, which makes each individual neuron subject to potentially irreversible damage. However, glia, cells that support and protect neurons, possess the ability to mitotically divide. Traditionally, glia were believed to play a secondary role to neurons, acting as supporting cells. This initial assumption is validated by the inability of glia to conduct synaptic interactions and electrical impulses like their neuronal partners (1). However, upon further investigation, it has been discovered that glia possess various qualities that render them equally, if not more, significant than neurons themselves. </span>

<span>A popular and widely accepted belief in neuroscience is the assumption that glia outnumber neurons in a nearly ten-to-one ratio. This notion was recently challenged in a study conducted by Barthheld et al. in 2016. They found that through the use of a new counting method, the isotropic fractionator, the glia-to-neuron ratio was closer to one-to-one (2).</span>

<span>The isotropic fractionator method departs from the traditional stereological technique of estimating cell numbers. Previously, cell counting was limited to well defined structures, excluding large neural regions of the brain that exhibit anisotropy - a tendency of some structures to exhibit different properties in different directions. This property is seen in aluminum, an anisotropic material where light reflects off the aluminum in different ways depending on the angle of light shone upon it. The isotropic fractionator transforms these highly anisotropic regions of the brain to isotropic, or homogeneous, suspensions of cell nuclei that can be easily counted (3). The use of this method led to the discovery of a one-to-one ratio of glia and neurons.</span>

<span>Despite their unexpectedly low cell count, glia continue to perform regularly in the regulation of neural repair. In the nervous system, there are two major types of glia: Schwann cells and astrocytes. Each type of glia operates within a subdivision of the nervous system and accordingly utilize different methods of neural repair. </span>

<span>Glia in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), or Schwann cells, are known to regress to an earlier stage after an injury. This stimulates axonal regrowth</span><span> via an upregulation of growth-related genes, resulting in remyelination - a feature unique to the PNS (4). Conversely, glia in the central nervous system (CNS), or astrocytes, suppress neural repair and form a “glial scar.” While the specific reasons for the differences in repair have yet to be elucidated, the primary intent of maintaining and protecting neurons remains the same.</span>

<span>Intrigued by the natural regenerative tendency of glial cells, a Penn State research team led by Dr. Gong Chen has been conducting research investigating the possibility of converting glia, specifically astrocytes,  that surround dead neurons into new neurons. This conversion is intended to be the best way to restore lost neural function. </span>

<span>This began with the use of the NeuroD1 protein, a neural transcription factor which, when inserted, could switch on neural genes in glia that were silenced during early brain development. The protein simultaneously switches off glial genes, turning the glial cell into a functional neuron (5). However, research has not investigated the fate of the remaining glia post-conversion, leaving some uncertainty about this novel method continually in revision. This method is unique because it has proven successful after neurons have died, shifting from the initial focus of saving dying neurons.</span>

<span>Previous research using the NeuroD1 protein has successfully converted glia to working neurons via a gene therapy method. Gene therapy works through the use of a vector that carries the favored gene. As viruses have evolved to be successful in penetrating the host genome, they are often used in gene therapy as the vector. The infectious part of a virus, however, is removed and causes no harm to the patient. </span>

<span>Despite the success of this method, the excessive cost of gene therapy treatment, sometimes reaching millions of dollars for a single patient, has isolated the large majority of those seeking affordable treatment for brain-related injuries. But a new method, pioneered by the same research team at Penn State that initially proposed the use of the NeuroD1 protein, has discovered an alternative method to expensive gene therapy, suggesting a drug therapy method instead. This drug therapy involves the chemical synthesis of four critical molecules discovered by Chen’s team and packages it into a single pill that can be orally ingested by the patient.  </span>

<span>Research into a drug therapy alternative began with the discovery of nine small molecules. However, </span><span>the intricacy of the specific sequence required to convert glia into neural cells stunted its transition to clinical treatment. The discovery by Chen’s team proposes a new method to expedite this process, ne</span><span>cessitating the use of only four molecules. Jiu-Chao Yin, a biology graduate student on Chen’s research team, was responsible for the identification of these four molecules. He describes that the combination of these molecules modulate chemical signaling pathways, resulting in their ability to convert nearly 70 percent of astrocytes into functional neurons (5). These glial cells, initially unable to conduct electrical signaling, have shown the ability to transmit electrical signals to each other four months post-culture. </span>

<span>The discovery of this streamlined drug therapy could potentially be used to treat various neural-related medical conditions such as stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease (6). Chen et al. are currently working to resolve technical issues regarding drug delivery as well as investigating potential side effects of the drug. This new method shows promise in both efficiency and cost while possessing the potential for large distribution.</span>

<span>This discovery may revolutionize regenerative medicine as it further discredits the widely accepted belief that once damaged neurons are incapable of regenerating. The research done by Chen et al. suggests that the secret to neural repair could lie in glial cells, whose potential and many applications we are only just beginning to unveil.</span>

<span><strong>Author's Note:</strong> This literature review was originally written as an assignment for my 102B Writing in the Disciplines: Biological Sciences class. At the start of this quarter I was lucky enough to get involved in plant metabolic engineering research in Dr. Patrick Shih’s laboratory, which exposed me to the field of synthetic biology for the first time. I immediately became fascinated with the whole process of engineering plants to produce medically relevant compounds. Through this review I hope to inform others of these surprising and highly relevant applications of plant genetic engineering.</span>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span>Plants produce a variety of secondary metabolites that participate in their natural defense and signaling mechanisms (3). Several of these complex molecules, such as fisetin, benzyl isothiocyanate, taxol, and verazine, have been found to have anticancer properties that have potential for future use in medicines or supplements [1,2,3,4]. The complexity of these molecules makes chemical synthesis in the lab difficult and expensive, so methods utilizing existing plant pathways are of great interest in current research [4]. This manipulation of metabolic pathways through making changes to enzymes, regulatory mechanisms, and using recombinant DNA techniques, is known as metabolic engineering [5]. </span>

<span>New applications in plants are driving optimization and innovation of plant metabolic engineering methodology. Current research is focused on biosynthesizing target molecules through microbial cell factories and engineering stable transgenic plant lines. With an estimated 38.4 % of people being diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime and rising costs for treatment in the US, there is an increasing need for implementation of effective treatment [6]. Successful implementation of these methods of biosynthesis could pave the way for cost-efficient and eco-friendly mass production of important pharmaceuticals. This review will cover key advances in anticancer metabolite production and will discuss the outlook of plant bioengineering as a feasible alternative to anticancer molecule chemical synthesis. </span>

<b>Constructing Gene Libraries and Databases</b>

<span>Before the metabolic pathways can be reengineered to favor a specific product, researchers must understand which genes are important for its function. While some studies are working with plants that already have a database of genetic information, others are diving into unexplored territory. cDNA libraries are one way to compile a database of relevant genes. The viral enzyme reverse transcriptase can construct complementary DNA sequences from RNA molecules. This is important because the RNA molecules themselves are too unstable to be sequenced directly. This cDNA can be ligated onto a DNA backbone and introduced into bacteria for translation and detection [7]. The cDNA libraries that this method produces can be used to discover the mRNA sequence of a known gene or to identify unknown genes in a pathway. Future research will rely on this data to further metabolite pathway optimizations. </span>

<span>In a recent study, researchers analyzed </span><i><span>Withania somnifera</span></i><span> leaf and root tissue cultures to construct a gene database for the withanolide production pathway. Withanolide is a metabolite in </span><i><span>W. somnifera</span></i><span> that acts as an anticancer drug in the presence of gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. By isolating RNA from tissue cultures of </span><i><span>W. somnifera</span></i><span>, the researchers were able to construct a transcript library and categorize it based on gene expression. Using this data, the researchers extracted transcripts coding for enzymes in the withanolide pathway, and mapped expression of these genes in the plant tissues. This database is key to performing further transient expression studies on this species [8]. </span>

<b>Microbial Cell Factories</b>

<span>Microbial cell factories are bacteria engineered to produce compounds native to other organisms. This review will focus on their application to plant metabolite production. One benefit of microbial synthesis is the lower cost of growing bacteria compared to growing plants. Synthesising complex molecules in a laboratory is often cost inefficient due to labor intensive multistep reactions and low product yields. Microbial synthesis is an attractive option for utilizing the machinery of many thousands of cells as a means of mass production [9].</span>

<span>One application of this method is for producing benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), a secondary metabolite found in cruciferous vegetables that is believed to reduce the risk of cancer. Due to the complexity of this compound, research has been conducted to prove the possibility of mass production through bacterial synthesis in E. coli. The scientists modified the first two proteins in the BITC pathway (CYP79A2 and CYP83B1) to function inside the prokaryotic environment. The next five enzymes tended to form nonfunctional aggregates, but analogous genes from </span><i><span>A. thaliana</span></i><span> were found to produce functional enzymes. Successful expression of the entire BITC pathway was verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), though the identification of the compounds left some room for error [9]. While the researchers ultimately were successful in modifying the pathway, they had to overcome significant hurdles to adapt the system to a bacterial environment. These hurdles are intrinsic to the conversion of plant to bacterial systems in general, so it is important to consider the potential costs associated with the necessary optimisation processes. These successes are highly specific to the BITC pathway; however, this study shows that microbial synthesis is an option for metabolite production.</span>

<span>Stahlhut et al. engineered a new biosynthetic pathway into E. coli that produced an anticancer acting plant metabolite known as fisetin. As current understanding of the fisetin production pathway is limited, the researchers hypothesized that they could model the intermediates and steps of the pathway on the known pathway of a similar molecule called quercetin. Gibson assembly, a technique that allows for multiple DNA fragments to be ligated into the same fragment, was used to prepare the plasmids coding for the proposed biosynthetic pathway. The cultures of the complete pathway included the buildup of several intermediates as well as fully formed fisetin. While this method of biosynthesis has the potential for low production costs, the technique would need to be substantially optimized to confront the degradation of product in the bacterial environment.</span>

<b>Transgenic Plant Lines</b>

<span>A current synthetic biology strategy for engineering plant metabolites is heterologous expression of a target pathway in plants. The general procedure includes cloning key genes for the metabolic pathway of interest, constructing a vector with those genes, and testing the expression transiently in the model plant through </span><i><span>Agrobacterium</span></i><span> mediated genetic transformation. The transient nature of this procedure allows for relatively fast results that can drive the strategic production of stable plant lines. Subsequent testing for expected levels of product in the transgenic plant segment provides information on the success of the transformation [2,10]. </span>

<span>Augustin et al. aimed to transform the cost-efficient and fast-growing crop </span><i><span>Camelina sativa </span></i><span>to produce a metabolite known as verazine. Verazine is the precursor of cyclopamine, which is a chemical that has been shown to inhibit a pathway that plays a role in tumor growth. Four genes known to be necessary for the verazine production pathway were cloned from </span><i><span>V. californicum</span></i><span>. They prepared three different vectors, the first included the first two enzymes in the pathway, the second vector had the first three, and the last vector coded for all four necessary enzymes. Preliminary research that suggested the gene GAD2 might be necessary for successful verazine biosynthesis, so they included it as part of the last two vectors. GAD2 (glutamate decarboxylase-2) is an enzyme that is required for the production of a co-substrate. </span><i><span>C. sativa</span></i><span> plants were transformed from each of these vectors and analyzed for evidence of the product. They quantitated verazine amounts in the transgenic lines averaging 54 pg/mg seed. While these levels indicate a successful construction of the pathway, much higher amounts would be needed to make this a viable strategy for mass production. Demands for cyclopamine are predicted to outrun current supply capability and attempts to harvest V. californicum for it or to use cell culture techniques have not proven successful [1]. Augustin et al. provide encouraging results that suggest that optimized transgenic C. sativa plant lines could be the answer to meeting the demand for the medicinally important drug. </span>

<span>While Augustin et al. use standard methods for the cloning of genes and construction of vectors, they chose to produce stable plant lines before analyzing the success of the pathway they constructed. One of the benefits of this method is more accurate results for levels of specific compounds produced, however the time it takes to grow a transgenic plant to seed significantly slows the research down. Transient expression is the temporary expression of genes through the introduction of transformed plasmid DNA to eukaryotic cells. This method allows scientists to efficiently test a pathway at various stages of optimization [10].</span>

<span>In Blanco et al., the production of metabolites known as flavinols was increased through overexpression of a protein known as CcMYB12. Flavinols naturally occur in high quantities in the Globe artichoke and are known to have many medicinal properties including anticancer functions. They targeted a gene believed to code for a transcription factor responsible for regulating the Flavinol synthesis pathway and attempted to integrate this gene into Arabidopsis and tobacco plants to upregulate the production of flavanol. The flavanol production pathway is already present, however medical applications would require higher production levels. In the Arabidopsis and tobacco plant lines transformed with the CcMYB12 gene, higher amounts of flavinols were produced as expected. This confirms the role of CcMYB12 as a regulator of the flavonoid pathway. Due to the understanding of the flavanol production pathway, Blanco et al. were able to focus on regulating the pathway through overexpression. However not all pathways are so well understood, and some are specific to certain plant species. In these cases, different strategies are necessary to express the molecule of interest.  </span>

<span>A related strategy for engineering metabolite production is the manipulation of transcription factors or regulatory mechanisms. Augustine et al. hypothesized that suppressing a gene involved in the conversion of glucoraphanin (an anticancer relevant metabolite), into undesirable metabolites would increase the levels of glucoraphanin accumulated in plants. They created RNA that codes for the downregulation of all homologues, or copies, of the GSL-ALK gene of interest. </span><i><span>Agrobacterium</span></i><span> was used to transform </span><i><span>B. juncea</span></i><span> plants, from which stable lines were produced and analyzed. They discovered a varying efficiency of regulation, with an overall 58% decrease in total glucosinolates. This had a pronounced positive effect on the reduction of unwanted side-products and the overall increase in glucoraphanin [11].</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span>Plant metabolic engineering has become an important topic due to the variety of anticancer relevant compounds that are only produced in certain plants. The goal of current research is to manipulate the metabolic pathways through microbial synthesis or transgenic expression in plants in order to produce high levels of these target compounds. Microbial expression comes with the challenges associated with transferring a plant based metabolic process into a completely foreign environment. However, microbial cell factories may be more cost-efficient than transgenic plants when considering the minimal maintenance requirements of bacterial colonies. In many cases, preliminary research must still be done to acquire a basic understanding of the main enzymes and genes necessary for each pathway’s function. As researchers begin to compile results and build transcript libraries, more precise optimization of metabolic pathways will become possible. Rather than focusing on recreating the natural production pipeline, future studies will have the opportunity to significantly manipulate the amount of an anticancer molecule in a plant. In a larger sense, this technology has the potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry by shifting from chemical factories to eco-friendly plant based drug production. </span>

<b>Abstract</b>

<span>A portion of all metastatic breast cancers overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). When HER2 is overexpressed, the cell uncontrollably divides.  This form of cancer is commonly treated with a combinatorial treatment of chemotherapy and Herceptin</span><span>©</span><span>, clinically known as trastuzumab, to specifically target overexpression of these receptor proteins. Recently, cardiotoxicity and cardiac adverse events have presented in patients treated with trastuzumab for ten years or longer. The prevalence of this side effect has resulted in several studies to determine trastuzumab mode of action in cardiotoxicity and its overall efficacy in long-term treatment. This literature review examines the association between trastuzumab-use and cardiac dysfunction, followed by recent discoveries that potentially explain the mechanism it affects. Finally, this review examines the effect of time interval on efficacy of trastuzumab and cardiotoxicity risk reduction in patients. More research is necessary to determine the absolute risk of cardiotoxicity with prolonged treatment and potential biosimilars that contain similar efficacy but reduce the risk of cardiac dysfunction.</span><b>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span>According to an article by Paddock (8), up to 20% of all invasive breast cancers are caused by human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 proteins, also known as erbB proteins, are a family of proteins that play a role in development and the maintenance of cells during a mammal’s lifetime. This protein is used as a dimerization (a process where two proteins bind together to carry out their function) component of other HER2 proteins to form a receptor; these receptors initiate a signaling cascade that controls the division and growth of cells (7). The overproduction of this protein is the cause of a quarter of breast cancers diagnosed yearly. This correlation has led to the targeting of HER2 for breast cancer treatment. Trastuzumab (commercially known as Herceptin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (an antibody from a non-human source that’s been engineered to work similarly in humans), that specifically targets the HER2 receptor (1). It binds to HER2 receptors to interfere with its dimerization process; this causes the cell to arrest and reduce HER2’s signaling pathway (1). Use of trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, has increased the 10-year survival rate of cancer patients from 75% to 84% (8).</span>

<span>Although trastuzumab has proven to be extremely effective in treating HER2 breast cancers, current studies have observed that cardiotoxicity is a side effect. Characteristics of cardiac dysfunction, as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee (CREC), can include a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), symptoms of congestive heart failure, associated signs of congestive heart failure, or a combination of a decline of LVEF by 55% and accompanying signs of congestive heart failure (10). Several retrospective analyses have been conducted on previous clinical trials using trastuzumab to determine the percentage of patients inflicted with cardiotoxicity. A cohort study conducted by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center observed that 27% of their patients experienced cardiac dysfunction as a result of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment (2). This study was one of the first to conclude that cardiotoxicity is a significant side effect that deserves more research and exploration.</span>

<span>This review will examine the association between trastuzumab use and cardiotoxicity, the mechanisms and pathways it affects, and the possible methods of reducing the risk of a cardiac adverse event in patients undergoing this treatment.</span>

<b>Trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity as observed in animal models</b>

<span>With the increased incidence rate of cardiotoxicity detected in patients treated with trastuzumab, researchers have attempted to recreate it in animal models that can be used to determine adverse effects. A pre-clinical investigation conducted by Milano et al. (5) induced cardiotoxicity with using doxorubicin and trastuzumab in a mouse model. Doxorubicin is an antitumor anthracycline that’s commonly used to treat cancer in conjunction with an antibody-specific treatment (5). </span>

<span>Through these mice models, the researchers found that trastuzumab alone decreased erbB2 and erbB4 gene expression in the cardiomyocytes of the left ventricle; this decreased expression led to dilation of the left ventricle but was normally reversible with discontinuation of the treatment. Doxorubicin, on the other hand, was shown to reduce the thickness of the left and right ventricle walls. Trastuzumab was found to exacerbate the effects caused by doxorubicin, not cause them (5). This study was one of the first to recognize and understand the effects of repeated trastuzumab and doxorubicin injections on pathophysiology. </span>

<span>The results from this study strongly suggest that trastuzumab has a role in exacerbating cardiac dysfunction induced by Doxorubicin, but it is not the sole cause. The results do not accurately describe the metabolic effect on trastuzumab in humans based on the physiological differences between human and mice. However, these findings have provided a new direction for research regarding the mechanisms underlying trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity.</span>

<b>Potential mechanisms of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity</b>

<span>While there were significant findings involving animal models, Milano et al. (5) failed to provide information for researchers to understand the pathways it affects. Mohan et al. (6) studied the effect of trastuzumab on autophagy in cardiomyocytes, using mice as a vehicle. The researchers hypothesized that trastuzumab-induced autophagy modulation has implications in the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS species production occurs in cardiomyocytes. The accumulation of cell damage develops into cardiotoxicity (6). The researchers found that trastuzumab dysregulates HER2-signaling, which leads to the inhibition of the autophagy pathway, disrupting the mitochondria’s function and increasings ROS production. </span>

<span>The researchers found that after 48 hours of treatment, cells fluoresced more intensely than the control cells in response to increased oxidative stress (6). This study offers evidence that trastuzumab-binding dysregulates HER2-signaling, which may interfere with the cell’s abilities to repair itself, due to oxidative damage caused by the overproduction of ROS. This opens up the discussion about whether or not trastuzumab-inhibition of erbB2 dimerization is the main method of action that causes cardiotoxicity. This study has been used as a stepping stone in understanding the mechanisms that underlie trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction.</span>

<span>Other researchers have used the results from the Mohan et al. (6) study to replicate trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity using human stem cells </span><i><span>in vitro </span></i><span>to better understand its effects in humans at the molecular level. Kurokawa et al. (4) measured cardiac function from human stem cells (iPS-CMs) after 72 hours of exposure to 1 µM of trastuzumab. The researchers discovered that iPS-CMs are able to replicate the cardiotoxic consequences of trastuzumab-inhibited erbB 2/4 signaling (4). Although this discovery has important implications for cancer treatment in humans, the researchers were only able to detect cardiotoxicity when iPS-CMs were also treated with Doxorubicin (4). </span>

<span>The results of this study are limited, due to the fact that researchers only utilized one line of human stem cells and did not fully replicate the cardiac microenvironment found in the culture medium. While this study offers a novel human model that can better replicate toxic effects of cancer treatments, it fails to provide clarification on the direct effect of trastuzumab on cardiomyocytes to induce cardiotoxic events. </span>

<span>The studies and clinical trials mentioned previously concluded that trastuzumab is effective and safe for use in most patients. However, the recent research between the association between long-term use of trastuzumab and cardiotoxicity necessitates further research and exploration. Mohan et al. (6) and Kurokawa et al. (4) concluded that trastuzumab affects the HER2 signaling pathway, which has important implications in the normal function of the adult heart. Even though this is the target protein for HER2 metastatic breast cancers, further research needs to be done in order to specifically target overexpression in malignant cells or the mutant machinery that enables overexpression. It’s important to explore the appropriate time interval to maximize the benefits of trastuzumab while maintaining a low risk of adverse cardiac events moving forward.</span>

<b>Efficacy and risk reduction associated with trastuzumab duration</b>

<span>Currently, trastuzumab is administered 1 year after chemotherapy treatment. However, recent studies have been conducted to test whether a shorter trastuzumab regimen administered during chemotherapy treatment would have similar efficacy with less risk of cardiac dysfunction in comparison to the standard. A clinical trial conducted by Joensuu et al. (3), hypothesized a 9-week combinatorial therapy of trastuzumab and chemotherapy offered the same benefit of standard treatment with trastuzumab. The researchers found that the 9-week regimen resulted in fewer cardiac events but were unable to prove that it had a significant impact on efficacy compared to the standard treatment (3). Similarly, the PHARE clinical trial hypothesized a 6-month regimen of trastuzumab compared to 1-year. The researchers were unable to conclude that the shorter duration of trastuzumab treatment resulted in the same or better therapeutic outcomes as the 1-year treatment even though cardiac dysfunction was significantly reduced. The researchers  acknowledged that the standard treatment resulted in a small amount of cardiac toxicities but were reversible with a stoppage of treatment, as observed in 93% of affected patients (9). </span>

<span>The trials conducted by Joensuu et al. (3) and Pivot et al. (9) fail to prove that a shorter treatment regimen has superior therapeutic effects, even if combined with chemotherapy. However, both trials observed that the development of cardiac dysfunction is present in both lengths of treatment. Their results further support the hypothesis that trastuzumab has a significant role in the development of cardiotoxicity. </span>

<span>The protocols used in these studies do not provide foundational evidence for predicting risks associated with long-term treatment using trastuzumab. While a small percentage of patients have irreversible adverse cardiac events, these patients are still a significant consequence for a widely accepted cancer treatment. Studies and further research should be focused on reducing and preventing the risk of major cardiac dysfunction in patients treated for longer periods of time.</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span>Despite the clear benefits trastuzumab provides, the risk of cardiotoxicity cannot be ignored. While the  risk of cardiotoxicity remains low and reversible in most patients, this is not the case for a minority of patients. Current case studies reported patients who were assumed to be low risk still developed irreversible cardiac dysfunction during treatment with trastuzumab. Thus far, the “cure” for cardiotoxicity has been stoppage of trastuzumab administration. This leaves the patient vulnerable to remission. In response to these new concerns, researchers have begun developing and testing biosimilars of trastuzumab for similar efficacy; however, success remains low. Cardiotoxicity is a major side effect of trastuzumab, but it is the solution on the market for metastatic breast cancers. Until more definitive research is done, physicians and patients should proceed with caution and recognize the potential risk associated with trastuzumab treatment.</span>

<strong>Author's Note</strong>
I would like to give special thanks to Professor Katherine Gossett (UC Davis) for encouraging me to write this paper and Dr. Angela Haczku (UC Davis Health) for her expertise in pulmonary diseases. Last fall, I decided to research idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after my grandfather was hospitalized and diagnosed with it over the previous summer. I quickly discovered that there wasn’t much research on the disease itself or how to treat it due to its rarity. The purpose of this literature review is to inform others about idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and to encourage further research on the subject. With time, this research could be vital in saving lives just like that of my grandfather.

<strong>Abstract</strong>
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an irreversible and fatal disease of the lungs. Although it has been associated with genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking, environmental factors (e.g. occupational exposure to gases, smoke, chemicals, or dusts) and other conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the mechanism and causes of IPF are not yet fully understood by researchers. However, recent studies have provided evidence that IPF may be caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the inhalation of chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants. These chemicals have been identified as polymethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG-P), didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), oligo(2-(2-ethoxy)-ethoxyethyl) guanidinium chloride (PGH), and a mixture of chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) and methylisothiazolinone (MIT). It has been suggested that the generation of ROS by these chemicals is responsible for damaging the cellular structures of the lungs and triggering the development of IPF through the activation of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. Studies have also shown microRNAs to be key regulators of the TGF-β pathway and the development of the disease. Several promising future treatments of IPF involve the inhibition of the TGF-ꞵ signaling pathway either through the administration of drugs containing sesquiterpene lactones, matrine, or oridonin compounds; or through the replenishment or inhibition of certain miRNAs. The studies detailed here highlight the importance of further research on IPF.

<strong>Introduction</strong>
Pulmonary fibrosis is an irreversible, fatal disease that results in scarring of the lung tissue and decreased function of the lungs. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis simply means that the cause is unknown. Patients with IPF typically experience difficulty breathing, with death caused by either respiratory failure or incurrent pneumonia. [1] The disease is characterized by marked collagen deposition and other alterations to the extracellular matrix (ECM), a network of macromolecules that provide structural support to the lungs. [1] These alterations to the ECM remodel and stiffen the lung’s airspaces and tissues. [1] It is also characterized by diffuse interstitial inflammation and respiratory dysfunction. [2] Although its cause remains unknown, it is believed that the main steps in the pathogenesis of IPF are initiated by the transforming growth factor β (TGF-ꞵ) signaling pathway and involves the migration, proliferation, and activation of lung fibroblasts and their differentiation into myofibroblasts. [3] Fibroblasts are cells that have a high ability to proliferate and to produce ECM and fibrogenic cytokines. [3] Fibrogenic cytokines are multifunctional immunoregulatory proteins that contribute to the inflammatory cell recruitment and activation needed to promote the development of fibrosis. [4] These cytokines can activate myofibroblasts, which are primarily responsible for the synthesis and excessive accumulation of ECM components, collagen and fibronectin, during the repair process that leads to fibrosis. [5], [6]

A 2011 outbreak of pulmonary fibrosis in South Korea prompted an onslaught of research as to how IPF may be caused and treated. [7] Specifically, this research has provided evidence that certain chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants can cause IPF through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have a powerful oxidizing capability that can induce the destruction of cellular and subcellular structures in the lung, including DNA, proteins, lipids, cell membranes, and mitochondria. [8] This damage caused by ROS has been found to promote the activation of the TGF-ꞵ signaling pathway and the development of numerous characteristics associated with IPF. [4] This research has been invaluable for the discovery of new potential treatments for patients with IPF.

<strong>Potential inducers of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</strong>
After the 2011 outbreak in South Korea, researchers were able to find a connection between IPF and exposure to chemicals commonly found in household disinfectants, such as those found in humidifiers and pools. They have suspected that these chemicals can cause pulmonary fibrosis by infiltrating the respiratory system as aerosol particles to induce cellular damage. The chemicals polymethylene guanidine phosphate (PHMG-P), didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), oligo (2-(2-ethoxy) ethoxyethyl guanidinium chloride (PGH), and the mixture of chloromethylisothiazolinone (CMIT) and methylisothiazolinone (MIT) attracted particular interest.

In a study evaluating registered lung disease cases in South Korea, it was revealed that 70 percent of registered patients that suffered from IPF or other forms of household humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury had used humidifier disinfectants containing the chemicals PHMG, PGH, or a mix of CMIT and MIT prior to their development of the disease [7] It was determined that the aerosol water droplets emitted by the humidifiers may have acted as carriers to deliver these chemicals into the lower part of the respiratory system, causing humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury. [7] It was also revealed that most of the affected patients in the study had used humidifier disinfectant containing the chemical PHMG. [7]

Another study detailed that even slight exposure to PHMG could cause cell death triggered by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). [8] Injury by ROS is typically followed by a fibrotic repair process involving increases in TGF-ꞵ expression, increased fibronectin, collagen synthesis, and a marked increase in the deposition of the ECM, all key characteristics of IPF. [4]

One way that ROS promote ECM deposition and IPF is by activating transcription factors like nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). [4] NF-κB is a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines that is typically bound to a cytoplasmic inhibitor. [9] One study found that exposure to the biocide (substance that destroys/prevents growth in organisms) and preservative PHMB was able to generate significant ROS levels and activate the NF-κB signaling pathway through the degradation of its inhibitor. [10] This is significant because the activation of proinflammatory cytokines is necessary for the recruitment and activation of myofibroblasts responsible for the increased ECM deposition that is characteristic of IPF patients. PHMB is also a cationic chemical and there is evidence that it can bind to negatively charged mucins, located within the mucous membranes of various organs. This can cause organs located in the respiratory tract to acquire increased susceptibility to PHMB and, in effect, a higher likelihood for the development of IPF. [10] Although the study did not match the exposure conditions of PHMB in humans, it has illuminated another way that individuals may develop IPF. [10]

In a study investigating the role of DDAC—one of the aerosols— in causing pulmonary fibrosis, mice exposed to DDAC exhibited fibrotic lesions that increased in severity over time. [11] Exposure to the chemical DDAC increased TGF-β signaling and appeared to maintain the differentiation of myofibroblasts. [11] This was complemented by the high expression of genes responsible for the production of collagen in fibrogenic lungs. [11] Overall, the form of pulmonary fibrosis that was induced by DDAC was mild, and so more research must be conducted before it can be concluded that the chemical DDAC is responsible for irreversible, severe pulmonary fibrosis. [11] It is also possible that some of the patients affected with humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury may have experienced synergistic or additive effects from using multiple humidifier disinfectants, but this can be difficult to determine. [7] However, this study does indicate that exposure to DDAC can result in the development of several characteristics typically associated with IPF.

<strong>PHMG-P as a potential causative of IPF</strong>
Of the chemicals listed in this literature review, PHMG-P has received the most attention by researchers. PHMG-P is a biocide that exhibits its antibacterial effect by disrupting the cell wall and inner membrane of bacteria, causing cellular leakage. [12] In a similar manner, PHMG-P can infiltrate the lungs in the form of aerosol particles and may cause IPF in individuals through the generation of ROS and the disruption of the ECM’s alveolar basement membrane. [4]

Disruption of the basement membrane occurs through increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that degrade various components of connective tissue matrices. [6] Metalloproteinase MMP2, in particular, destroys the basement membrane by solubilizing ECM elastin, fibronectin, and collagen, helping immune cells and fibroblasts migrate to alveolar spaces. [12] This can lead to severe damage of the lung architecture and aberrant ECM deposition typical of IPF. [4]

In a study using an air-liquid interface (ALI) co-culture model to study the pathogenesis of fibrosis, PHMG-P was shown to trigger ROS generation, airway barrier injury, and inflammatory response. [4] Recall that exposure to other chemicals suspected of being potential inducers of IPF had similar effects. Therefore, it can be concluded that PHMG-P infiltrates the lungs in the form of aerosol particles and induces airway barrier injury by ROS. [4] This would result in the release of fibrotic inflammatory cytokines and trigger a wound-healing response that would eventually lead to pulmonary fibrosis. [4]

In an animal study, mice exposed to PHMG-P experienced difficulty breathing and exhibited pathological lesions similar to the pathological features observed in humans affected with IPF. [12] A time course of 10 weeks was even established for PHMG-P-induced pulmonary fibrosis. [12] Throughout this period, it was found that a single instillation of PHMG-P contributed to an increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels and elicited an influx of inflammatory cells into lung tissue. [12] This recruitment of inflammatory cells contributes to the deposition of ECM components in the lungs and, as a result, the development of IPF. The instillation of PHMG-P was also suspected of blocking T cell development and impairing its function in the immune system. [6] This would result in an insufficient resolution of inflammation caused by the increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and result in stacked fibrotic changes and the progression of IPF. [6]

Another study claimed that PHMG-P could cause pulmonary fibrosis through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. [9] Recall that the NF-κB signaling pathway is responsible for the production of proinflammatory cytokines associated with the development of IPF. According to the study, mice exposed to PHMG-P generated a large amount of ROS and produced significant levels of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner. [9] These cytokines produced by the NF- κB signaling pathway are known to activate the TGF-β signaling pathway, increase collagen production, and promote wound-healing and tissue remodeling responses. [4] As these responses are characteristic of IPF and the cytokines exhibited in this study are known to be produced through the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, there is strong evidence that PHMG-P can induce IPF through the NF-κB signaling pathway.

<strong>The Mechanism of IPF</strong>
<em>TGF-β’s importance in the mechanism</em>
Various studies of IPF have indicated that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), one of the most significant fibrotic cytokines, plays a key role in the mechanism that induces IPF. TGF-β1 is credited with inducing the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and upregulating the secretion of ECM proteins (like collagen) in IPF. [13]

Specifically, growth factor TGF-β1 binds directly to the TGFβ receptor II (TGFβRII), triggering the recruitment and activation of receptor TGFβRI by TGFβRII. [14] This step leads to the increased production of collagen through the activation of a collection of proteins called the Smad 2/3 complex. [13] The activated Smad 2/3 complex accomplishes this by entering the nucleus to enhance the transcription of profibrotic genes such as those that produce collagen. [13] This idea has been heavily supported by experimental evidence. Exposure to the chemical DDAC was found to increase cellular mRNA levels of TGF-β1 by two-fold. [11] This increase contributed to the activation of the Smad 2/3 complex [11] and induced the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. [15] Overall, this led to the development of pulmonary fibrosis-causing fibrotic lesions in mice. [11]

In another study, TGF-β was found to promote the development of IPF by inhibiting the expression of the microRNA let-7d, driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased collagen deposition. [1] Typically, epithelial cells are important to maintaining lung functionality by acting as a barrier against pathogens and other harmful compounds and secreting protective substances. [4] During EMT, however, these cells increase in cellular motility [16] and are transformed into myofibroblasts, resulting in the acceleration of IPF. [4] Additionally, epithelial cells during EMT promote the recruitment of fibroblasts, while simultaneously inhibiting collagen degradation and elevating the levels of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). [4] TIMP-1 binds to metalloproteinase MMP2 to promote the growth of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, accelerating ECM deposition while preventing its degradation. [12] This corroborates the claim that the TGF-β signaling pathway is a crucial component in the mechanism of IPF.

<em>MicroRNA’s role in TGF-β regulation and pulmonary fibrosis</em>
MicroRNAs are mRNA sequences that bind to complementary mRNA of proteins to prevent their translation and expression. They are also involved in multiple steps of fibrosis, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. [16] During the progression of IPF, miRNAs are known to regulate the process in which epithelial cells transition into myofibroblasts (EMT) to promote fibrosis. [16] Since each miRNA is specific to a particular mRNA sequence, miRNAs may function as either promoters or inhibitors of IPF. One study found that the miRNA, miR-433, can act as a promoter of IPF by upregulating receptor TGFβRI and growth factor TGF-β1 to amplify TGF-β signaling. [13] In a separate study, it was confirmed that miR-30c-1-3p may act as a negative regulator of pulmonary fibrosis through targeting the mRNA and preventing the expression of receptor TGFβRII. [15]

In a study headed by the Department of Pathology at the University of Michigan Medical School, it was concluded that the development and pace of progression of IPF may be due to abnormal miRNA generation and processing. [1] It was found that in rapidly progressing IPF biopsies, five miRNAs significantly increased and one decreased when compared to slowly progressive biopsies. [1] This indicates that miRNAs have a significant influence on the mechanism of IPF. Additionally, members of the miR-30c and let-7d family significantly decreased in both forms of IPF when compared with unaffected individuals. [1] As stated previously, certain members of the miR-30c family are believed to be negative regulators of IPF and members of the let-7d family are inhibitors of EMT. All of the stated evidence signifies that miRNAs, in addition to the TGF-β signaling pathway, play important roles in the development of IPF.

<em>Other factors to consider in the mechanism</em>
The NALP3 inflammasome is another important factor to consider in the mechanism of IPF. The NALP3 inflammasome is an innate immune system receptor suspected of being the main cause of persistent inflammatory response and exacerbation of fibrotic changes. [12] According to a study focused on researching PHMG-P-induced fibrosis in mice, the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome appeared to contribute to fibroblast proliferation and the progression of IPF due to the production of the cytokine IL-1β. [12] IL-1β is known to increase the production of ROS needed to induce lung tissue damage by upregulating the expression of the cytokine chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1). [6] This upregulation of CXCL1 and resulting tissue damage was exhibited in the study, reinforcing the claim that the NALP3 inflammasome is a central component in the IPF mechanism. [12]

Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), an antibody that has an important role in the immune system, also may have a role in the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis. In a study supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, immunoglobulin A, the most abundant human immunoglobulin, was compared with TGF-β in its role in inducing pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. [3] In this study, sIgA enhanced collagen production and induced responses in cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). [3] MCP-1, similar to IL-6 and IL-8, is responsible for stimulating collagen synthesis and TGF-β production in fibroblasts. [6] It was concluded that under IPF, sIgA may make contact with lung fibroblasts and result in exacerbating airway inflammation and fibrosis through enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines and ECM collagen. [3]

<strong>Potential therapeutic approaches and alternative methods of treatment</strong>
According to recent studies, only two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, have been approved by the FDA for IPF treatment, and they have still failed to be significantly effective in treating the disease. [13] However, current studies on therapeutics that inhibit the TGF-β signaling pathway appear promising. Two particular drugs of interest are oridonin and matrine, along with their derivatives.

Oridonin, a major compound found in the herb Rabdosia rubescens, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat inflammation and cancer for hundreds of years. [2] In a study focused on testing its effectiveness in treating IPF, it was found that exposure to oridonin significantly decreased the levels of three major biomarkers of fibrosis—hydroxyproline (HYP), beta silicomolibdic acid (β-SMA), and collagen, type 1, alpha 1 (COL1A1)—in a dose-dependent manner. [2] Additionally, oridonin attenuated pathological changes such as alveolar space collapse and infiltration of inflammatory cells. [2] Oridonin was able to achieve this through significantly inhibiting the upregulation of collagen production and the activation of Smad 2/3 in lung tissues, an important step in the progression of IPF through the TGF-β signaling pathway. [2] This presents a strong case for the use of oridonin as a treatment for IPF.

Matrine, similar to oridonin, also has roots in traditional Chinese medicine. Matrine has been shown in several studies to exhibit significant antifibrotic effects through the inhibition of the TGF-β pathway. In one study, matrine was shown to have an inhibitory effect against liver fibrosis by reducing the expression of TGF-β1 and instead increasing the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). [13] Through the inhibition of the TGF-β/Smad pathway, matrine was also shown to exhibit antifibrotic activities on cardiac fibrosis. [13] These antifibrotic effects are not just held by matrine, but their derivatives as well. The matrine derivative MASM was also shown to exhibit potent antifibrotic effects. [13] As the TGF-β signaling pathway is a central component in the mechanism of IPF, matrine and their derivatives present themselves as strong candidates for anti-IPF therapeutics.

Other drug candidates for the treatment of IPF are sesquiterpene lactones. Sesquiterpene lactones are naturally occurring compounds that are known to harbor extensive connections with the TGF-β1 signaling pathway. [5] This makes these compounds and their analogues strong drug candidates for IPF treatment. In one study, two out of 44 semi-synthetic analogues of sesquiterpene lactones were found to highly inhibit the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, ECM production, and the formation of fibroblasts. [5] This inhibition of ECM production and the formation of fibroblasts corroborates the claim that administering sesquiterpene lactones is an effective treatment for IPF.

As mentioned earlier, studies have shown microRNAs to be negative regulators of IPF. One study suggests that the replenishment of miR-30c may be a promising treatment. [15] Increased levels of miR-30c would promote the negative regulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway, suppressing the differentiation of myofibroblasts and preventing excessive collagen accumulation. In this manner, the replenishment of miR-30c would attenuate IPF symptoms. The inhibition of certain miRNAs, such as miR-34a, has also been shown to be an effective treatment. The inhibition of miR-34a by treatment with the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (CSP) was found to prevent pulmonary fibrosis by preventing the overgrowth of fibroblasts. [17] Although the manipulation of miRNA expression has been shown to have a large impact on the development of IPF, there is one issue with this method of treatment. A single miRNA can target thousands of mRNAs, making the function miRNAs have in pathophysiological events involved in IPF unclear. [17]

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
Although there is limited research on the etiology of IPF, this should only serve to motivate researchers to study its causes, mechanism, and potential treatments further. Thus far, the chemicals that have been shown to be potential inducers of IPF are PHMG-P, DDAC, PHMB, PGH, and the mixture of CMIT and MIT. However, out of all the chemicals, only PHMG-P has been heavily researched, and so additional studies are needed to confirm the other chemicals’ involvement in inducing IPF. Additionally, this research could be expanded upon through the study of the effects of other household disinfectants on the human body to determine whether they are also factors in inducing IPF. Besides the discovery of potential causatives, studies have also further illuminated details about the mechanism. Specifically attracting interest is the TGF-β signaling pathway in addition to miRNAs and their involvement in the regulation of IPF. Furthermore, the manipulation of TGF-β and miRNA levels with oridonin, matirne, and sesquiterpene lactones has been linked to favorable outcomes in the treatment of IPF. With further research, these treatments could become common practice and improve the quality of life for patients suffering from IPF.

<strong>Author's Note:</strong> Since I started working on plant metabolites as an undergraduate researcher in the Shih Lab, I’ve developed a great appreciation for the power of plant genetic engineering to address a wide variety of problems. A uniquely global and increasingly relevant concern is how to continue to feed the world’s growing population in the face of climate change. I decided to write this paper to provide a snapshot of the current research being done to innovate crop species that will survive in the face of climate change. As part of this review. I also wanted to address ongoing concerns about the safety and impact of GMOs on consumers and the environment, and whether these genetic engineering strategies have the potential to make a positive impact on food security.

&nbsp;

<strong>Introduction</strong>

As the world population continues to rise, climate change is also having an increasingly large impact on agriculture in the form of rising temperatures and intensified weather variations. Population growth is challenging researchers and farmers to find new ways to increase crop yields without access to more land or freshwater. Population is expected to increase from the current 7.7 billion to 9 billion by 2050 (1,2). However, it was found in 2000 that about 70% of the available freshwater was already in use. Meanwhile, climate change is introducing new challenges to crop productivity and stability. By 2050, the global crop demand may increase as much as 110%, which emphasizes the need for new, powerful strategies for crop improvement.

Genetically engineered crops have been used in agriculture since the mid-1990s, and have been instrumental in overcoming serious agricultural challenges such as disease outbreaks and overuse of toxic insecticides (3). In contrast to traditional breeding, genetic engineering allows for a direct transfer of one or more genes of interest from either closely or distantly related organisms. In some cases, a plant is modified solely by turning on or off one of its own genes (4). These methods allow for fast and precise changes that target a specific trait. Since their introduction, numerous studies have measured their potential for health and environmental risks, as well as their benefits. This review will discuss the impacts of genetically engineered crops from an environmental and health perspective. Additionally, I will look at how genetically engineered crops are currently being applied to address food security concerns in the face of climate change.

&nbsp;

<strong>What is the Impact of Genetically Engineered Crops?</strong>

<em>Environment</em>

As genetically engineered crops have now been used in the field for many years, the environmental impacts can be assessed. The most abundant type of genetically engineered crops are insect resistant crops, specifically Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) resistant corn and cotton. Bt is a soil bacterium which produces proteins that are toxic to certain insects (5). Bt crops have been modified to produce Bt genes as protection against specific pests (3). These crops have been grown commercially since 1996 (2), which has allowed long term environmental studies to be conducted. In a two-year field trial on the impact of transgenic maize on soil fauna, Fan et al. found that there was no impact on biodiversity, abundance or composition of the soil fauna. They compared samples taken in varying conditions from either transgenic maize or non-transgenic maize controls. The researchers found that the insecticide transgene did not affect the soil ecosystem, while factors such as time of year, pH, sampling time, and root-biomass all had significant effects (6). In a 2003 review on Bt crops, Mendelsohn et al. also found that there were no negative impacts observed on species of endangered insects, earthworms, or non-target insects. However, one negative that applies to all insecticides is that pests will eventually gain resistance. Engineering crop varieties to have several different resistance genes has been shown to slow this process (2).

Another class of genetically modified crops that are currently in use are herbicide-tolerant crops. Herbicide-tolerant crops are designed to be tolerant to broad-spectrum herbicides that can be used to control surrounding weeds. Use of herbicide-tolerant corn and soybeans has been shown to decrease the use of highly toxic herbicide sprays in favor of an amino-acid derived, non-toxic alternative (Roundup), and has also encouraged low-till farming practices which have been correlated to significant reductions in greenhouse gasses (2). Weed resistance is a concern with herbicide-resistant crops, especially when a single herbicide gene is overused. In some cases, high selection pressures caused by overuse of a single broad-spectrum herbicide have led to resistant weeds. If unchecked, these resistant weeds can spread across farms and negatively impact crop growth (7). New varieties of crops resistant to multiple types of herbicides should help mitigate this problem by allowing farmers to rotate several types of herbicides. A widespread adaptation of these new varieties and consistent practice of sustainable herbicide application will be important to avoiding negative outcomes of herbicide-tolerant crop use.

Implementing these genetically engineered crops has contributed to overall decreases in the amount of toxic insecticide and herbicide sprayed. Just as with chemical pesticide and herbicide sprays, proper steps must be taken with insect-resistant or herbicide-resistant crops to delay resistance in the affected insect or weed. These steps include rotating planting of herbicide-resistant crops and using weed control tactics with different modes of action to avoid putting high selection pressure on one type of resistance.

<em>Health</em>

The consensus from long term studies carried out to address biosafety concerns of genetically modified crops, is that they are just as safe as their natural counterparts. Genetically engineered crops are subjected to a variety of tests on a case by case basis before they are implemented, and now long term data shows that there have been no side effects from possible unintended chemical compositions of crops, making them just as safe as those derived from traditional breeding. There are, however, concerns about next generation genetic engineering, which targets regulator genes instead of a single functional gene. Targeting regulator genes could allow scientists to target plant stress response pathways, and engineer plants to have multiple desirable traits (8). Additional research must be conducted to assess the plant-wide changes caused by affecting a player in a signaling cascade.

<em>New Approaches to Crop Improvement</em>

While the current genetically engineered crops have been found to have a positive effect on crop yields, the increases are not enough to keep up with projected population growth. Additionally, climate change is predicted to cause stressors to crops such as drought, rising temperatures, and weather variations among other things (2). Therefore, scientists are looking for new and creative genetic engineering techniques to create robust and high-yielding crops for our future.

One of the main targets for genetically engineered crops is adaptions to grow and produce quality yields under higher temperatures. In a study investigating the genes responsible for creating lower quality, chalky rice grains under high temperature conditions, Nakata et al. looked at the role of a starch metabolizing enzyme, known as amylase, in the packing of starch into rice grains. Their team used transgenic rice modified with a reporter gene attached to each isotype of the amylase gene. By comparing the activity of plants overexpressing each variety, they were able to identify specific amylase genes as targets for genetic modification. Rice variants with these modifications would remain higher quality, with tightly packed starch, even if grown under non-optimal higher temperatures (9). Another study tested the responses of a previously created transgenic rice line called HOSUT under high amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), a heat wave, and nitrogen enriched conditions. They found that the transgenic line, which has enhanced sucrose transport, has a superior yield than the control line (Certo), and that increased CO2 conditions resulted in higher yields in Certo with only minimal increases for HOSUT. They concluded that the minimal response of HOSUT to the increased CO2 was indicative of HOSUT already being saturated due to its optimized transport capabilities. The HOSUT line is already optimized for translocation of carbon, which they were able to show by increases in starch in the grains in HOSUT only. HOSUT also produced more yield in response to increased nitrogen, making it a good option for producing high rice yields under variable climate change conditions (10) The HOSUT line is a great example of how genetic engineering can be used to fortify and optimize crops to both survive under atypical conditions and produce enough yield to keep up with demand.

Another problem that researchers are addressing through genetic engineering, is drought. Selvaraj et al., developed and field tested two drought tolerant rice lines, created by introducing an Arabidopsis stress response gene (galactinol synthase) with a maize promoter. Galactinol synthase produces galactinol, a sugar that functions as an osmoprotectant, keeping water from leaving the cells. These galactinol synthase genes were introduced into two commercially available rice lines and tested in the field under drought and well-watered conditions. Under drought conditions, the collection of galactinol resulted in higher grain yields, while under well-watered conditions no significant yield increase was observed. Galactinol is a sugar that functions as an osmoprotectant, keeping water from leaving the cells. The results of these field trials show that these rice lines are ready to be integrated into ongoing breeding programs (11). Wang et al. also tackled the problem of drought stress caused by global warming on fruit such as apple trees. They transgenically expressed an aquaporin gene found in Fuji apples that has increased expression during fruit growth in tomato. The transgenic plants did have an increased drought tolerance, observed as an increased sensitivity of their stomata to water loss, and a larger fruit size when compared to wild type. This research will be continued in apples next with the goal of producing plants with larger fruits when well-watered, which will also be more tolerant to drought due to increased water transport efficiency (12).

A third target for genetic engineering solutions is circadian rhythms. Understanding and controlling circadian rhythms in crop plants has the potential to adapt plants to radically different environments. One group at the Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology is tackling this challenge in rice. This group expressed an Arabidopsis transcription factor known as Circadian Clock Associated1 (CCA1) under the Timing Of Cab Expression 1 (TOC1) promoter, which are both part of the circadian clock machinery in Arabidopsis. They found that overexpression of the CCA1 in rice had negative results, while repressing it caused positive changes to plant morphology. The researchers used RNAi, which is a biological process where small fragments of RNA are used by the cell to target complementary mRNA for destruction, thus silencing expression of the encoded protein. By comparing RNAi constructs based off of three different parts of the CCA1 gene for silencing the gene expression, they found that the RNAi derived from the 3’-terminal end of the CCA1 gene had the best impact on plant morphology (13). This study is an important first step towards unlocking the power of using circadian clock genes to breed plants better adapted to a changing environment.

One new strategy being considered is a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method that could be used to quickly develop improved crop varieties without transgenes. CRISPR/Cas9 can introduce specific changes into a plant genome without being limited by existing variation. Applying this method, scientists will be able to stack multiple edits into a plant within a single generation, resulting in transgene-free progeny. One benefit of this method is that it may allow for more complex changes to polygenetic traits or signaling pathways. For example, this could be helpful for targeting complex plant stress response pathways. This technology is currently limited by the availability of annotated reference genome sequences for plants other than Arabidopsis. Scheben et al. suggest that taking a genomics-based approach would allow for a comparison of species-wide genome diversity, making differences in copy-number visible and thus available for editing. While the authors suggest that this method creates plants that are indistinguishable from those created through natural breeding and random mutations, bans against genetically modified crops may target methodologies rather than the final result (14).

&nbsp;

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Currently implemented genetically engineered crops, have been shown, through years of testing and trials to be at least as safe, both towards the environment and in terms of human health, as naturally bred varieties. While new transgenic lines must be screened and tested on a case-by-case basis, the overall benefits of this technology make it an important tool that may be necessary to confront upcoming challenges to agriculture. Climate change and population growth are putting steep demands on crops to survive in more hostile environments while also producing higher yields. Current efforts are focusing on vital crops, such as rice, corn, wheat, and fruits, to create drought-tolerant, heat-tolerant, and yield-optimized plants.

        <strong>Author's Note: </strong>
<span>Conservation biology has always been an interesting field to me. After having previously submitted two neuroscience-related articles to the </span><i><span>Aggie Transcript</span></i><span>, I decided to explore a new topic. The bear-sighting on campus last spring was on my mind, mainly because I began to wonder about the status of bears in our state. Given their symbolic status in California, I imagined that their conservation would be well-documented. This article serves as a brief report of the black bear’s current status in California, and the population genetics methods used by researchers keeping track of the animal.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>Shortly before 6 a.m. on June 4, 2019, a very rare occurrence captured the attention of the entire Aggie community. A young, male black bear was spotted wandering near the UC Davis Arboretum’s Redwood Grove [4]. The campus police and fire departments, in conjunction with California’s Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), worked to tranquilize the straggler and release him to the nearest habitat west of the city of Davis. This moment of excitement on campus sparked the curiosity of many who care about wildlife and conservation. According to CDFW, black bear populations have been on the rise over the past quarter-century, so what are the challenges the species face and how do biologists keep track of populations? It is also important to evaluate the evolutionary track of the species to understand if it can withstand changing environments, so what is the genetic diversity of the state’s population of black bears?</span>

<span>California’s history with bears is complicated. Many sports teams in the state are fondly named after them and, most notably, a prominent grizzly roams a patch of grass on the state’s flag. While it is a cherished symbol of the state, the grizzly faced a savage end to its reign as apex predator. The Spanish threw the bears in fights to the death against bulls and dogs, and later American settlers hunted them into oblivion. The last California grizzly was seen in 1924 and has since been extinct [2]. Nearly one hundred years later, environmentalists are aspiring to reintroduce the grizzly bear through back-breeding, cloning, or genetic engineering [2]. Many might consider these to be aspirational long-term goals, and in the meantime have focused on the current population of bears in the state. What is known for sure is that the absence of the grizzly in the state has opened up more room for a different population to flourish [5]. </span>

<span>The real challenge in the many decades since the last grizzly has been observing and managing the population of California black bears. Unlike their phylogenetic cousins, black bear populations still exist in the state and are relatively stable. The department estimates that b</span><span>etween 25,000 and 30,000 black bears occupy 52,000 square miles in California. There are three subpopulations of the bears which are recognized as the North Coast/Cascade, Sierra, and Central Western/Southwestern regions. Unsurprisingly, about half of the state-wide population of black bears resides in the North Coast/Cascade region [1]. </span>

<span>In 2016, a population genetics study of California Black Bears was published by the CDFW in conjunction with the Wildlife Population Health and Genetics Laboratory at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. The study analyzed the Central Western subpopulation, specifically in Monterey and San Luis Obisbo counties and compared genetic samples to bears in Mono County, which is between Yosemite National Park and the border with Nevada. Research of this sort evaluates abundance of the species and the genetic diversity of small populations to predict migrating patterns, check for genetic bottlenecking and inbreeding, and to examine the overall strength of the genetic pool [3].</span>

<span>One way researchers acquired genetic material was through a hair sampling technique. Two rungs of barbed wire were tied around a circle of trees. At the center of this sample area was fish bait and a sweet scent bait made of honey and berries. As bears approached the bait, their hair would get caught in the wires. The spacing of each sample station was strategically determined from a grid design that considered habitable ranges for the bears and safe distances from human-related dangers such as roads and watch points. DNA extraction and further genotyping was used to identify unique individual bears. From there, most of the work came from computer-programmed statistical tests such as Bayesian genetic clustering algorithms to evaluate the population structure for each data range [3]. </span>

<span>Researchers have come to believe that the central coastal population of bears has been in the region for about 50 years and are descendants of the population in the Sierra region that have migrated towards the coast. The report concluded that there are very few bears populating in Monterey County because there has not been enough time for them to disperse adequately within the coastal region. A potential reason for their slow migration towards Monterey County could be urbanization and the construction of highways that provide real physical barriers [3]. </span>

<span>A 2009 study (Brown et al.) by researchers at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine also analyzed the population genetics of California’s black bears, this time on a statewide scale. Using historical documents to track translocations of bears by humans, but also the analysis of microsatellite DNA from subpopulations of the bears, the researchers came to similar conclusions as the aforementioned CDFW report. It is believed that the extinction of the California grizzly, which roamed a significant portion of the state’s central coast, made room for the black bear to begin to inhabit regions such as Monterey and San Luis Opisbo [5]. Brown et al. used genetic samples from 540 bears, which were collected between 1990 and 2004 throughout the state. To determine the genetic structure of the California populations, the group used a computer program that “groups individuals into clusters based on genotype without consideration of sampling geography.” Following this, the determined clusters were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, one of a handful of tests for genetic populations. This is an evaluation method that assumes no evolutionary changes are taking place in the genetic pool. Doing this makes it possible to simply analyze the allelic frequencies within the population without accounting for potential changes. </span>

<span>Wildlife management is an increasingly important and difficult operation for any organization. Urbanization and global climate change will certainly become more prominent issues in black bear conservation. This is not even considering the laws on hunting or other policy-related challenges that may arise. The CDFW, in conjunction with researchers from around the state, has made a concerted effort to observe this population. If we are to learn a lesson from the past, it would be to not take for granted the abundance of the bear population in California. There has been a lot of excitement about the black bear’s proliferation, but our state will need to be attentive if we are to keep the health of our wildlife in balance. </span>

<span><strong>Author's Note:</strong> The anti-vaccination movement has recently gained traction with many families across the nation and I wanted to tackle the idea of anti-vaccination and where it came from. I also wanted to see if there was any credit due to the anti-vaccinators and see if there was any truth to the idea that more vaccinations might be bad.</span>

&nbsp;

<span>In April 2019, public health officials declared a measles outbreak in Los Angeles. To many, this sounded almost absurd; measles was eradicated in the United States in 2000 [4]. The outbreak highlighted the severity of a movement that many had declared irrelevant: the anti-vaccination movement. In light of this event, many had to question: what is the anti-vaccination movement? When did it begin? Is there any truth to the movement?</span>

<span>To understand the anti-vaccination movement, one must first understand vaccines and their history. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a vaccination as, “a product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease.” [1]. The human immune system uses white blood cells to fight infections in the body; specifically, there are three types of white blood cells that work together to fight infections: macrophages, B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes [2]. When a cell becomes infected or dies, it releases a chemical that attracts macrophages, which will engulf and degrade the cell. If the cell was damaged or died due to a virus or bacteria, the macrophage will leave behind antigens, which are recognized by the immune system as harmful [10]. When the immune system recognizes the antigens, B-lymphocytes will produce antibodies to attack the antigens and T-lymphocytes will attack cells in the body that have been infected by the identified antigen. After the infection is dealt with, the immune system will create memory cells that act immediately if the body encounters the same germ again. Vaccines work by imitating an infection; they do not cause illness but they will stimulate the production of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and memory cells to fight the disease in the future. Most vaccines require multiple doses to ensure full immunity, and how frequent these dosages are required depends on the vaccine [2]. </span>

<span>Our knowledge of vaccines has not always been as vast as it is today. Evidence suggests that the earliest form of inoculation was in China during the late 1600s when emperor K'ang Hsi had his children inoculated after surviving smallpox (the process involved grinding smallpox scabs and inhaling them) [5]. The practice of vaccination has grown considerably since then, becoming vastly popular in the West by the 17th century. In 1853, Britain passed a law that made it mandatory for citizens to receive a smallpox vaccination and in 1855, Massachusetts passed the first U.S. law mandating vaccination for smallpox, allowing vaccinations to grow and develop. </span>

<span>In the late 20th century, research on the negative effects of vaccines started to emerge. A 1995 study published in </span><i><span>The Lancet</span></i><span> linked the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine with bowel disease. Wakefield, a gastroenterologist and researcher in the study, went on to further speculate that persistent infection with the vaccine caused disruption of the intestinal tissue that could lead to autism. This led to the study that would capture the attention of parents for decades to come. In 1998, Wakefield and his colleagues published a case series study in which, out of 12 children who had recently been administered their MMR vaccine, eight had the measles virus in their digestive system and were demonstrating symptoms for autism. Wakefield then went on to claim that the combined vaccination led to this, and advocated instead to adopt single-antigen vaccinations as opposed to combined MMR vaccines [3]. He did not, however, list how he came to this conclusion, saying “the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (rather than monovalent measles vaccine) has been implicated” [3].</span>

<span>The link between autism and the MMR vaccination was studied intensively over the next few years, and no reputable study ever found a similar link. Additionally, a study published in </span><i><span>The Journal of Pediatrics</span></i><span>, while acknowledging a slightly lower than average antibody count when the combined vaccination was employed, stated that there was no significant reason why single antigen vaccinations should be favored over combined vaccinations. The lower antibody count was deemed irrelevant in light of the fact that failure of the vaccine was extremely rare in fully immunized children [7]. In 2010, </span><i><span>The Lancet</span></i><span> formally retracted the paper, and three months later, Britain’s General Medical Council banned Wakefield from practicing medicine in Britain. Finally, in 2011, it was revealed that Wakefield had falsified most of his data; in his study, he reported eight children developed symptoms of autism when in reality, there were at most two cases. In addition, two of the children had developmental delays that were not mentioned in the final published work [3].</span>

<span>Despite the study being completely discredited by the scientific community, the damage to society had been done; after the Wakefield paper was published, vaccination rates dropped below 50 percent in some parts of London. Luckily, immunization rates drastically rose since then, with over 90 percent in the UK vaccinated in 2013, with BBC declaring a “universal recovery” [8]. Although vaccination rates are high, the US still faces about 60 cases of the measles every year, caused by international travelers who carry the disease [9]. While the spread of misinformation due to the Wakefield paper has mostly subsided, its legacy continues keeping a minority of children in the US unvaccinated and susceptible to antiquated and preventable diseases.</span>

<b>Author's Note</b><span>: Since the advent of </span><span>Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-CRISPR Associated Protein 9 (</span><span>CRISPR/Cas9) discovery and biotechnological breakthroughs thereafter, this revolutionary application has been primarily focused on human health, particularly fostering solutions to numerous debilitating ailments. However, the general public has offered little attention towards the use of this engineering feat in a broader ecological system. Upon watching the new Netflix original </span><i><span>Un</span></i><i><span>natural Selection</span></i><span>, discussion of considering the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in New Zealand’s effort to completely eradicate invasive species piqued my interest. The following article is an exploration of CRISPR/Cas9 prospect into New Zealand’s bold environmental pursuit and its potential ecological impact.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Abstract</b>

<span>Since it has become feasible to cross oceans to reach unforeseeable land masses, invasive alien species (IAS) are an increasing threat to international biodiversity. Moreover, no other region faces as great of a peril as New Zealand (NZ), which holds the record as the nation </span><span>with the highest survival rate of threatened avifauna (birds of a particular region) species</span> <span>[5]. In 2012, New Zealand physicist Sir Paul Callaghan introduced a large-scale eradication program to permanently remove eight invasive mammalian predators (</span><span>rodents: </span><i><span>Rattus rattus</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Rattus norvegicus</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Rattus exulans</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Mus musculus</span></i><span>; mustelids: </span><i><span>Mustela furo</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Mustela erminea</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Mustela nivalis</span></i><span>; and the common brushtail possum: </span><i><span>Trichosurus vulpecula</span></i><span>) [5]. Four years after this grand proposal, the NZ government committed to a national challenge titled “Predator Free 2050” (PF 2050) to pursue this audacious goal. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<span>Approximately 85 million years ago, NZ was one of the first landmasses to split from the supercontinent Gondwana and as it shifted away, it did not carry mammals until bats flew and aquatic species swam to this island. [7]. With the introduction of rodent species initially through Polynesian settlement some 750 years ago and thereafter European seafaring ventures, the endemic species of NZ have been left vulnerable to novel predators. Consequently, at least 51 native bird species that have evolved adaptive skills of remaining close to the ground have been unsuccessful at surviving alongside these rodent predator species [4]. These invasive omnivorous rodents prey on birds, eggs, seeds, snails, lizards, and fruits. As a result, their varied diets prompt competition with the native fauna, further placing pressure on their vulnerable survival [7]. Despite CRISPR/Cas9 modifications offering the greatest potential in gene drive to eliminate these unwanted predators, several techniques implemented to control these invasive populations,  such as pesticides, trapping innovations, and biological factors have given favorable results.  </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Past Successes and Future Endeavors </b>

<span>For decades, the NZ government has pursued eradication initiatives to permanently eliminate foreign invasive species on small local islands. Through concerted efforts, several of these projects have proven successful in the restoration of the natural biodiversity this island nation boasts. </span>

<span>In June of 2009, the NZ Department of Conservation (DOC) undertook a multi-action plan to simultaneously eradicate rodent, rabbit, stout, hedgehog, and cat species in </span><span>Rangitoto and Motutapu islands. After three years of </span><span>aerial dispersion of anticoagulant Pestoff 20R</span><span>TM</span><span> combined with trapping and indicator dogs, the island witnessed </span><span>total elimination of the islands’ stoats and four rodent species; declination of rabbit and hedgehog population by 96%; and over 50% reduction in cats [7]. </span>

<span>Despite these successful feats, the invasive species fecundity and ability to adapt to these challenges still present an overwhelming challenge to reach the goal of complete eradication. Recently, more direct approaches delving into novel genetic inheritance techniques have been explored to serve as a potential permanent solution. Termed the“Trojan Female Technique” (TFT), the method makes use of the correlation of sperm fitness dependence on the abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [2]. Healthy sperm is dependent on sufficient mitochondrial level for energy production to manage motility and fertilization. For example, experiments conducted on </span><i><span>Drosophila melanogaster</span></i><span> supports the causation of reduced spermatogenesis and sperm maturation due to induced mutations in cytochrome mitochondrial gene [9]. Contrasting female eggs, the asymmetric greater dependence of sperm on mtDNA for normal functionality results in only male populations to be the sole source of target. Induction of mitochondrial mutations in females to compromise total sperm viability in future male progenies will serve as an effective control to population growth. </span>

<span>Although seemingly promising, TFT is not guaranteed to completely eradicate propagation for several reasons. For starters, males with impaired fertility can still provide sufficient sperm count to fertilize eggs on a population-based scale. Furthermore, in circumstances where females do receive nonviable sperm count, they can still seek adequate functioning sperm through matings with other males. On a larger scale, should the mutation pervade, selection pressures could still inadvertently choose for nuclear modifications to make up for the mitochondrial defects [2]. These flaws raise the need for more pervasive and permanent resolutions.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Daisy Chain CRISPR Gene Drive</b>

<span>The recent biochemical breakthrough underpinning the ability to effectively and precisely modify genes with CRISPR/Cas9 has allowed for potential biotechnology to boom in the realm of ecology. The simple generation of a short RNA sequence into a virus or bacterium to serve as a vector, guides the cutting mechanism of Cas9 to specific regions in the genome to be excised, prompting for these double stranded breaks to be fixed through DNA repair mechanisms. While these fixtures can potentially repair the gene, it can also raise the possibility for the gene to be disabled, introduce a new function, or create an unforeseen mutation. Given the right specific targeting in the germ line, this approach houses the innovation for exterminating entire species through gene drive [6].</span>

<span>The mechanism behind gene drive overthrows the traditional Mendelian sexual reproduction concept of proportional contribution from both the male and female parent. The power comes from the ability of one genetically modified (GM) contributor encoding for the ‘gene drive’ to cut the other set of chromosomes lacking these genes and replace this excision with a self-replicating copy. In effect, this divisive modification would push for an otherwise heterozygous offspring from a wild-type mating with a GM partner to become homozygous for certain genes to be carried on and propagated by future generations. Given that these genetic alterations do not affect the fitness of the organism, dissemination of 1% of the population with CRISPR modified genes can lead to 99% of the local population carrying the genetic indicator in as little as nine generations (The use of gene editing to create gene drives for pest control in New Zealand).</span>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-2752 aligncenter" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-300x62.png" alt="" width="300" height="62" />

<span>Such a unilateral approach poses political and ethical challenges amongst neighboring nations with diverging ecological approaches to confront pest control. Should this pervasive gene drive program reach beyond its intended border, great difficulty would arise in maintaining this ecological enclosure. For example, possum is on the list of invasive species in NZ while just 2,500 miles west, its neighbor Australia keeps this species of marsupials under protection. As such, scientists have devised a simple model to localize gene alterations, coined The Daisy Chain.</span>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-2751 aligncenter" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-300x243.png" alt="" width="300" height="243" />

<span>Unlike the original gene drive method in which all components necessary for transformation (CRISPR, edited DNA, and guide RNAs) are provided on the same chromosome, Daisy Chain provides a self-exhaustive means of guaranteeing genetic edits. This tool is designed so that  each component required for genetic alteration is dependent on the presence of a different element upstream on the gene found on the same locus to be activated [8]. The most downstream portion of this chain contains the “load” of engineered dominant lethal genes preventing reproduction, which will be promoted to higher frequency in the population within several generations. For instance, should an engineered allele contain three elements A, B, and C, element C would render element B to drive, which will in turn cause element A carrying the final load to drive. The initial element (C in this case) does not actually drive, thus is restricted by the number of altered individuals released into the wild and will be lost via natural selection over time. During initial implementation, the presence of C will increase B in abundance, but B will eventually decline and finally disappear as C is lost in the population. The rapid rise in abundance of B will also cause A to increase in frequency within the local population; however, with the decrease of B, A would not be driven and will ultimately vanish as well [1]. Using MIT Professor Esvelt’s analogy, “... the elements of a daisy drive system are similar to booster stages of a genetic rocket: those at the bottom of the base of the daisy-chain help life the payload until they run out of fuel and are successively lost.”</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Challenges with Daisy Chain CRISPR Gene Drive</b>

<span>CRISPR/Cas9 technology’s ability to potentially alter these invasive species’ fecundity provides an avenue of pursuing NZ’s goal of PF 2050. Despite the developed understanding of how to carry out this plan, scientists in NZ are still working to piece together the genomes of stoats and possums in order to understand where to properly facilitate the engineered RNA sequence. Other barriers that must be acknowledged are the unprecedented approach to genetically modify marsupials and the difficulty of implanting hundreds to thousands of oocytes to be dispersed amongst their population. </span>

<span>Beyond these known difficulties, scientists still tread in unknown terrains pertaining to whether these mutations can have pernicious effects in the survival, health, and reproductive success in propagating these mutations within their populations. Further exploration into the development of these modifications, and the potential impacts they can have on these animals, must be investigated on model organisms prior to widespread use. </span>

<span>Of the eight listed mammalian species vied to be permanently eradicated from NZ, Mus musculus holds the most promise, given the extensive knowledge of the </span><i><span>Mus musculus</span></i><span> genome. With the help of scientists outside of New Zealand, joining in on the efforts to identify which germline gene to focus on, this project has received international attention.</span>

<span>Although the daisy drive provides promising potential, research collaborators at MIT and Harvard have identified a possible risk of, “... DNA encoding a drive component from one element to another, thereby creating a ‘daisy necklace’ capable of a global drive” [1]. Due to this rare recombinatory event arising from the similarity of DNA sequences, these investigators have looked into circumventing the problem by creating numerous alternatives to CRISPR components and selecting the model with the greatest diversity. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span>From their renowned aviary to reptilian species, New Zealand’s islandic geographical region houses some of the most biodiverse fauna known to man. The arrival of human settlement has introduced predatory species, causing endemic species to experience extinction at concerning rates [4]. With the purpose of preserving their unique remaining diversity, New Zealand has committed to concerted efforts of varying methods to eradicate these invasive vertebrate pests. Investigation into genetic modifications can provide for more expansive and thorough techniques to eliminate these human introduced pests and allow for these endangered species to thrive once again. By further exploring daisy chain CRISPR/Cas9, this effort can be genetically inherited by offspring, allowing for nature to carry out this effort. As opposed to continued efforts of targeting each individual one by one, conservation ecologists can borrow from molecular biologist’s toolkit to revolutionize the means of pursuing pest control and perhaps even pave the road for future endeavors with similar pursuits. </span>

<b>Author's Note: </b><span>As a biochemistry major who is interested in pursuing astrobiology research, I initially wrote this literature review for an assignment in my Writing in Biology course. Methods of life detection and what we know about life is a field in which we still have much to discover and explore, given Earth as our only example, and I hope to be involved in this exploration myself in the future.</span>

<b>Abstract</b>

<span>Ocean worlds, such as Enceladus, Saturn’s largest moon, provide intriguing environments and the potential for life as we continue to explore the Solar System. Organic compounds have been discovered in plumes erupting from the moon during flybys and point towards the presence of amino acids and other precursors of life. The data collected from these flybys, in turn, has been used to calculate the theoretical amounts of amino acids present in the oceans of Enceladus. While this data is intriguing, it relies on a limited definition of life, based on organisms and macromolecules that have only been observed on Earth. Other methods, including using nucleic acids or nanopores for detection, have been proposed. Nucleic acids utilize binding to identify a broad spectrum of compounds, while nanopores utilize the measurement of ionic flow. These alternative methods allow for a broader spectrum of compound detection than terran-based methods, creating the potential to detect unfamiliar kinds of life. Research into more holistic detection should continue.</span>

<b>Introduction</b>

<span>The search for life elsewhere in the Solar System is becoming increasingly relevant, and more importantly, feasible. Icy moons, such as Europa, Titan, and Enceladus, have been identified as holding the greatest potential for extraterrestrial life within the Solar System [1]. Europa and Enceladus, with seas below icy crusts, have geysers with unidentified fluctuations, along with evidence of tidal warming and geologic activity [2]. The Cassini spacecraft identified these geysers on Enceladus during flyby in 2006, spouting from four specific fractures on the surface of the moon [3]. Analysis of the vapors produced show that they mainly consist of water, along with CO</span><span>2</span><span>, N</span><span>2</span><span>, CO, CH</span><span>4</span><span>, salts, other organic compounds, and silica particulates [3, 4]. This points towards evidence of hydrothermal activity, the movement of heated water, which has the potential to provide necessary energy for life [4]. Additionally, the discovery of volatile aliphatic hydrocarbons in these plumes potentially indicate some degree of organic evolution within the seas of Enceladus [4].</span>

<span>However, there is no consensus yet on how to detect and identify life [1, 2]. Some scientists propose looking for life based on the shared ancestry hypothesis, which proposes all life shares the same genetic ancestry [2]. Others propose there is a potential for extraterrestrial life to present variations from terran life that we may neither be able to recognize nor detect with our current methods of biochemical detection [5]. Experimentally, the potential for nucleic acids based on different backbones has already been identified [5]. Here, we examine the range of proposed methods for identifying extraterrestrial life. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Proposed theories and methods based on current knowledge of life</b>

<i><span>Collection of amino acids</span></i>

<span>Current data collected from Enceladus’ plumes presents organic compounds that provide potential evidence of amino acid synthesis taking place in the oceans of the moon. Steel et al. used the thermal flux at the moon’s South Polar Terrain (SPT) to predict the hydrogen produced by hydrothermal activity. The predicted rates of production ranged between 0.63 and 33.8 mol/s of H</span><span>2</span><span>, and from there, amino acid production rates were estimated to be between 8.4 and 449.4 mmol/s [4]. Annual biomass production was also modelled in these calculations and estimated at 4 · 10</span><span>4  </span><span>to 2 · 10</span><span>6</span><span> kg/year, compared to 10</span><span>14</span><span> kg/year on Earth. These estimates, however, are dependent on the environment being an abiotic, steady state ocean; the actual production rates could be different if there is life present in Enceladus’ ocean [4]. </span>

<span>While this limits our predictions of Enceladus’ true environment, it still provides a basis that can be extrapolated for use in the design of modules to be sent out. One such module that has been proposed is the Enceladus Organic Analyzer, which is designed to analyze amino acids through chain length variations [3]. To properly collect and analyze the amino acids proposed to be in Enceladus’ oceans, there are several requirements. The sample must be collected from the subsurface ocean with minimal degradation, isomerization, racimerization, and contamination of biological molecules and amino acids [3]. A collection chamber made of aluminum has been modeled, designed to reduce the thermal heating caused by collection of samples, in order to best preserve them. If the moon contains bacteria as postulated, this design will lyse and kill collected cells through either heat or shock but release their more stable chemical components for analysis [3]. This depends highly upon current knowledge as a starting place, focusing with a limited scope on amino acid and cell identification. Another such method using cell identification is digital holographic microscopy. </span>

<i><span>Digital holographic microscopy</span></i>

<span>The development and improvements of microscopy, while beneficial, depend heavily on the assumption that life in the same form as terran cells will be found. Investigators propose digital holographic microscopy (DHM) as a more efficient alternative over traditional light microscopy [1]. This technology produces a 100-fold improvement in the depth of field and is able to monitor both intensity and phase of images. However, even with the increase in resolution, differentiation of cells and cell-shaped structures is difficult, even before taking into account potential differences in extraterrestrial life. Refraction, an emerging field, was able to differentiate experimentally between crystalline structures and cells in the study’s Arctic samples. While the technology can be miniaturized and discriminate between cells and minerals, it depends highly on actual capture of a sufficient number of cells from plumes. This experimental data was obtained using dye-less techniques, which still function in the context of organisms without DNA or RNA, and refraction with the potential to differentiate structures [1]. DHM is both useful for detection of cells based on collected data and for the potential discovery of organisms without nucleic acids as we know them. </span>

<b>Expanding outside the current knowledge of life</b>

<i><span>Detection using nucleic acids </span></i><i><span>
</span></i><span>Other experiments and proposals, while not explicitly targeting life outside the current perceptions, propose a more holistic collection of data. This carries the potential of identifying life outside our current scope, as opposed to focusing directly on known amino acids and cells. Using a broader concept of nucleic acids as a means of detection and identification is one such method. </span>

<span>Oligonucleotides, through forming secondary and tertiary structures, have specificity and affinity to a wide variety of molecules, both organic and inorganic [2]. Even at a length of only 15 base pairs and within complex mixtures, these molecules can bind to what is being analyzed, or the analytes. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a process that can identify oligonucleotides that bind very specifically to analytes. However, this method proposes the use of low affinity and low specificity nucleic acids that are typically discarded in this process. Unlike antibodies, this method requires no prior knowledge of the surface attributes or the three-dimensional structure of the molecule that is being bound. Through accumulating a wide range of binding sequences and statistical analysis, a vast number of compounds can be collected and environmental variations identified. Additionally, this method posits that the optimal means of capturing sequences is through proximity ligation assay (PLA), a technique currently used in scientific fields. PLA purifies the binding species based on ligation and amplification, producing a lower background than sieving, which separates based on size. It is also capable of capturing a vast range of sequences and structures, including inorganic, organic, or polymeric molecules [2], and thus is more capable of providing holistic results.</span>

&nbsp;

<i><span>Nanopore-based sensing</span></i>

<span>Nanopore-based sensing, presented as an alternative to current methods, detects and analyzes genetic information carriers in watery systems without making assumptions about its chemical composition [5]. This system relies upon the restrictions placed on these sorts of compounds within watery systems, as the repeating charge of backbones keeps polymer strands from folding and favors solubility in water. A nanopore is a hole with a diameter of a few nanometers, surrounded by an insulating membrane within two chambers containing an electrolyte solution.</span> <span>Due to its diameter, only single-stranded DNA can pass through the nanopore, allowing for slow movement and characteristic signals that produce data clearly distinguishable from other molecular data. This method can detect and analyze molecules by measuring the ionic flow across the membrane. While biological nanopores are able to detect and resolve individual terran bases, nonbiological, solid-state nanopores provide the same function, avoiding the limitations of detecting terran molecules that may be present in biological nanopores. Graphene, with its crystalline form, can have its membrane adjusted to only accommodate one nucleotide at a time or can be sculpted to produce varying sizes of nanopores. This could allow for the detection of other polymers with chemical and sterical properties that vary from currently known polymers. This approach has the potential to analyze a broad range of molecules without any assumptions regarding the external structure’s outside charge and linearity. Few identified nonbiological polymers are structured this way, so any data picked up by nanopores would be significant [5].</span>

<span>There are, however, limitations to this approach. Nucleic acids have high electroporation speeds, making it necessary to find methods of slowing these speeds down for accuracy [5]. Electroporation uses an electrical charge to make the cell membrane more permeable. Potential methods include control through physical factors, such as temperature, salinity, and viscosity. Conditions of collection on other planets also pose the problem of extreme dilution of the target molecules, which depends on a large number of variables [5]. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span>Radiation and stability are major concerns in moving forward with any sort of data collection from extraterrestrial worlds. Mechanisms and samples are potentially open to the detrimental effects of extreme vacuum and solar radiation [5]. These problems should be addressed in conjunction with the technology actually being used for analysis to produce the most beneficial results. Some of these issues have been addressed to some extent, such as using microfluidics for collection because they are unaffected by the vacuum of space due to their own internal surface tension [3]. However, these problems need to be explored further in all cases to ensure that each method can function in uncontrolled or non-terran environments.</span>

<span>The presented data indicates potential for the existence of amino acids in these environments. Even though prediction and detection of these amino acids seems a logical step forward, the development of further, broader technology for life detection should also be pursued. Current knowledge is limited by the qualities of terran life; while that is a well-supported starting point, methods that leave open the potential of deviation from this point may allow for the detection of otherwise overlooked forms of life. Moving forward, it seems only logical to combine these methods that can detect both the known and the unknown, allowing scientists to gather the widest possible array of data in future missions, especially on promising worlds like Enceladus. </span>

<strong>By Anna Cutshall, Animal Biology, Global Disease Biology minor '21</strong>

<strong>Author's Note: </strong>When considering the topic of my literature review and analysis, I wanted to select work that I could continue research on in graduate school. As I entered academia, my career and life experiences had prepared me well for the unique intersection of veterinary medicine, ecology, and epidemiology. I have been on a pre-veterinary track for many years and have worked professionally in the veterinary field for more than three years. As an Animal Biology major and Global Disease Biology minor, my coursework largely centered around the emerging threat of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. These experiences considered, my primary research interests lie in how we may integrate veterinary medicine into One Health practices to better combat emerging disease threats. In this literature review, I investigate the viability of anthelmintic drugs against arthropod vectors of disease. The use of anthelmintics against arthropods is fairly new, and the pool of current literature is limited but promising. This review was written for those, like myself, who are interested in new approaches to the control of tropical diseases, especially through the lens One Health. I hope to leave readers with a clear picture of what is next for this field, what gaps in the data should be filled, and how we can use information gained in responsible, sustainable ways to combat both emerging and established vector-borne diseases.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
This literature review analyzes the efficacy of currently available anthelmintic drugs against key disease vectoring arthropods. When comparing effective dosages between different drugs and vector genera, we found that relatively low concentrations are effective against most vectors, but there is evidence to suggest that ivermectin resistance has been established in some species (Aedes spp). The avermectin drug class also displayed limited efficacy over time, as the drugs degrade in vertebrate species faster than the isoxazoline drug class or fipronil. We determined that the current findings related to this method of vector control are promising. However, further research must be conducted before we implement anthelmintics for mass drug administration as a part of integrated vector management.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
Vector-borne diseases threaten the well-being of hundreds of millions of people globally. This is predicted to increase as climate change and human activity facilitate the spread of vector species to previously unoccupied locations. In a press release by the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito &amp; Vector Control District, it was reported that multiple invasive mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti, had been identified in northern California [1]. Recent literature suggests that these habitual expansions may be due, in part, to climate change as these species are able to adapt to broader regions that are of similar climate to their native regions [2]. The continued spread of these species leaves unprepared countries at risk for outbreaks of the diseases vectored by invading species. Moreover, most vector-borne diseases remain uncontrolled in endemic regions. The most direct way to mitigate the threat of globalizing tropical vector-borne diseases is to control the species that are vectoring them. Unfortunately, traditional insecticide-based methods of vector control have become ineffective due to the emergence of insecticide resistance. In 2012, the World Health Organization identified the status of insecticide resistance as “widespread”, as most of the globe reported resistance in at least one major malaria vector [3]. Traditional spray and topical insecticides have been compromised by such resistance. Therefore, it is essential that new methods of vector control,without acquired resistance, be discovered, evaluated, and implemented.

There are many new methods of vector control currently under evaluation. These include genetically modifying vectors to render them sterile, the use of entomopathogenic fungi and viruses, trapping, repellents, and environmental modification [4]. As we continue to evaluate each method for its efficacy, the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) method may be our best option for the elimination of many tropical diseases. Through IVM, we take careful and integrated approaches to vector control via intersectional communication between Public Health officials, Governments, Non-Governmental Organizations, and communities in which we hope to implement our strategies [5]. IVM calls for multiple vector control strategies, and increasing control efficacy via synergy between control efforts. Unfortunately, the primary tool utilized for the control of adult mosquitoes, insecticides, has lost efficacy over time. This is a result of vector insect populations developing resistance to common insecticides, such as pyrethroids and organophosphates, that are used to control adult mosquito populations. However, there is a reservoir of insecticides that have not been utilized against human disease-vectors, which therefore have minimal acquired resistance . This class is oral insecticides, or insecticides ingested by vertebrates that act when a vector is exposed via blood meal from a treated animal. The use of oral insecticides has been standard in veterinary medicine for years, in the form of flea and tick prevention. Common classes of oral insecticides include avermectins, isoxazolines, and phenylpyrazoles. These compounds have been standard in human and/or veterinary medicine as ectoparasiticides, demonstrating their safety for use in vertebrates. Avermectins, isoxazolines, and phenylpyrazoles have similar modes of action as neurotoxins, with both interrupting the function of GABA-gated chloride ion channels, resulting in insect paralysis [6, 7]. Importantly, there is still diversity within these classes as tools against vector species, as they bind to different sites on the GABA receptors [7, 8]. Investigating the efficacy of these drugs for use as insecticides, against key vectors of diseases such as malaria, zika, west nile virus, leishmaniasis, and African Trypanosomiasis, could be part of the solution to the increasingly urgent problem of insecticide resistance.

Research is currently underway, across the globe, to investigate the efficacy of ectoparasiticides against disease vectors. The question still stands, however, if the approach of oral insecticides is any more effective than the traditional insecticides available. To answer this question, we assessed the current literature regarding the testing of ectoparasiticides against disease vectors, and developed a database of studies testing the efficacy of these compounds against vector insects. This analysis aims to determine the relative efficacy of these compounds to determine if these drug classes are worth consideration for use in vector control and management.

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Materials and methodology</strong></p>
To establish a database of the relevant literature, we first mined the scientific literature via the UC Davis Library. Using access granted to undergraduate students, the search terms utilized were input as follows: title/abstract contain “vector” AND “veterinary” AND “control” AND “arthropod” in the key word function. Papers were then selected for further analysis. These articles were input into an AI-based literature analysis tool, “Research Rabbit”, to identify additional relevant studies [9]. In addition, studies were selected from the works cited of previously selected works. Papers not testing the efficacy of oral insecticides on adult disease vectors were excluded from the study. Additionally, papers without comparable data (did not supply direct mortality or density data) were also excluded.

Each paper was analyzed to extract relevant data on the efficacy of oral insecticides against disease vectors. The data was collated into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Categories selected for further evaluation included: drug type, the concentrations used, associated concentration resulting in 50% mortality (LC50 values), time to mortality, the reduction of vectors present in field study by visual count (resting density), and drug effects on vector fecundity. However, for the purposes of this study, we focused on LC50 and temporal values. Other categories were not consistent across publications.

When creating data visualizations for comparison of different drug types, R’s “ggplot2” package, “dplyr” package and “esquisse” package were used [10-13]. The categories determined to be best for visual comparison were “Temporal Data” and “LC50” data. After initial visualization was made in R, figures were exported to Adobe Illustrator to edit aesthetically, which was limited to modification of font types and caption content [14]. When creating visualizations for LC50 data, both sandfly and mosquito vectors were compared on the same figure, to compare the efficacy of not only drugs in relation to each other, but also drugs in relation to their efficacy against different disease vectors. When creating the data visualization for this comparison, the drugs “Moxidectin” and “NTBC” were excluded. Moxidectin’s LC50 value was too high to allow for reasonable comparison to other drugs, and NTBC only had a value for tsetse flies (Glossina spp), which were not represented in any other drug. Additionally, the Lutzomyia spp displayed LC50 values too high to be effectively compared to other disease vectors. When visualizing temporal data, only Anopheles spp and Phebotomus spp had enough supporting information in the literature for effective comparisons. There were 5 studies that supplied data for Anopheles spp temporal data and 2 studies that supplied data for Phlebotomus spp temporal data. These temporal data were plotted as Day of Feeding against Mortality, faceted by drug type, and grouped by dose. 2 Figures were created, one for Phlebotomus spp and another for Anopheles spp.

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Results</strong></p>
<strong>Database Creation</strong>
From the initial search in the UC Davis Library system, 15 studies were selected. Then, based on the output from Research Rabbit, an additional 5 studies were selected. Finally, 3 additional papers were identified and integrated into the analysis from the references of the 20 studies. These 23 studies were then evaluated individually from January, 2021 through March, 2021.

We obtained multiple data categories for comparison between the selected papers. Figure 1 displays the summary of the resulting database. Due to the recent nature of this research, resources from which to draw for our database were limited. Table 1 shows a summary of the data types and the number of papers each data type was collected from. Within each paper, some investigated efficacy against multiple vector genuses while others investigated only one. Based on the data we were able to collect, we will be moving forward directly comparing temporal data as well as LC50 data.

<strong>Comparing Effectiveness of Dosages Between Drugs</strong>
We sought to compare the concentrations of drugs required to be effective against the disease vectoring arthropods studied. Figure 2 displays the LC50 values chosen for comparison as a “lollipop” plot. Within the plot, each “dot” represents a single datapoint taken from a study, and 7 studies were compiled to create the plot. In this figure, we are able to compare 2 major drug classes: avermectins and isoxazolines. The isoxazoline drug class had more available data across insect families, and it is clear that the LC50 value is variable between genuses. Sandflies have more resistance to isoxazolines (especially fluralaner) than mosquito species. Amongst the avermectins, Anopheles spp. Display the most consistent, and relatively low LC50 values. However, Aedes spp. displays higher resistance to ivermectin compared to Anopheles spp.

&nbsp;

<strong>Comparing Temporal Data</strong>
Temporal data involving different insecticides were first to be compared. In temporal data, the “Days Post Feeding (Day of Blood Meal)” represents the number of days after the initial dosing of the vertebrate animals (for example, “Day 3” indicates mosquitos that fed on an animal 3 days after it was given the drug). We were able to create 2 figures for comparing the efficacy of drugs over time at various doses. Doses were represented as variance in color in the figures. Figure 3 displays the efficacy of oral dosing to vertebrates of eprinomectin and ivermectin against Anopheles spp. over time. Both of the drugs in this comparison were of the avermectin class, and neither displayed robust effects on mortality past the 15 day mark after single-dosing of vertebrates with the drugs. Additionally, we observe great variance in the efficacy of ivermectin, even within dosages (that is, mortality varied within dosages between different studies). Unfortunately, mosquito genuses outside of Anopheles did not provide enough data to compare efficacy over time.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4072 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/02/unnamed-3.jpeg" alt="" width="512" height="385" />

Created in a similar fashion, Figure 4 displays the efficacy of oral dosing of vertebrates with fipronil and fluralaner. Here, two separate drug classes were tested for efficacy. While fluralaner (a member of the isoxazoline drug class) acts in a similar mode of action to avermectins, it maintains efficacy over time in Sandflies. Because mosquitos displayed more sensitivity to isoxazolines than sandflies, (Figure 2) one may predict similar, if not more deadly, effects when isoxazolines are tested over time for mosquitos. The drug fipronil displays varying efficacy between doses. Unfortunately, the study involving fipronil did not collect data past 21 days of administration, but it is possible some of the dosages would have remained effective from visual interpretation of the figure. Due to the limited amount of studies investigating the efficacy of oral insecticides, we were not able to compare the efficacy of all drugs over time, as other studies used different methods of efficacy measurements.

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
Based on the findings of our review of currently available literature, oral insecticides certainly show promise as a method of Disease Vector management. As displayed in Figure 2, we are able to determine effective dosages for each drug as a concentration in blood. However, there was significant variance in the data between taxa and between drugs. The highest resistance was observed in Aedes spp. against ivermectin, which could be evidence of acquired resistance due to the common use of ivermectin in humans as an anthelmintic [15]. Another significant variance observed was the relative resistance of sandflies to isoxazolines, requiring approximately twice the concentration or more compared to mosquito species [16]. It is unclear if this effect carries over to other drugs, as there is no available data.

There were also studies analyzed that were not included in the visual data analyses performed. These included studies that investigated the efficacy of isoxazolines against the kissing bug, of nitisinone against the tsetse fly, a field study, and data from otherwise integrated studies measuring the effect of the drugs on fecundity of arthropods [16-22]. The investigation by Loza et al. regarding the efficacy of isoxazolines against the kissing bug showed similar temporal data results to papers investigating isoxazolines against Sandflies, which was visualized in Figure 4 [17]. The isoxazoline drug class, then, has been shown to be effective against 3 major disease vector families. Another drug class also shows promise. A study by Sterkel et al proposes the use of nitisinone (traditionally used in the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, a genetic disorder) as an insecticide dispensed to vertebrates, and investigates its efficacy against the African Trypanosomiasis vector, the tsetse fly. This study highlights the importance of looking for alternative methods to vector control, and manipulates a characteristic of a drug originally developed to aid in human disease against disease vectors. The 2021 study found that concentrations above 0.5 micrograms per milliliter in blood impacted survival of feeding tsetse flies significantly, while also studying pharmacokinetics when ingested by mouse models [18]. Pharmacokinetic data supplied by the mouse models in this study may assist in any later calculations for human dosage. No evidence is available on the effectiveness of nitisinone on other disease vectors.

Three studies supplied data involving sublethal effects on adult arthropods, including fecundity. These studies found that there were significant effects on Anopheles spp. fecundity, regardless of vertebrate being dosed and observed across multiple doses [20-22]. There is no currently available data involving the effects of isoxazolines or phenylpyrazoles. Should they be provided, however, they show additional promise as vector management tools. When an insecticide is able to exhibit both lethal and sublethal effects, particularly regarding fecundity, insects that survive the initial exposure produce less offspring than their unexposed peers.

In order for these methods to be effective in Disease Vector management, there would need to be a considerable number of individuals in the population participating to make a significant impact on the burden of vector borne diseases [16, 19]. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) is expensive, and cost is a limiting factor in many of the areas we hope to lower disease burden in. Due to this, and issues related to the accessibility of MDA, it is important that drugs remain effective for an extended period of time. Fortunately, we found this to be the case. As evident in Figure 4, both isoxazoline drugs display extended efficacy on mortality of sandflies over 40 days after initial vertebrate dosage. Additionally, it may be that fipronil displays a similar effect in higher tested dosages, following the trajectory of the available data. Unfortunately, there is limited literature on this subject, so we are unable to say with absolute certainty that these effects would carry over to mosquito species. Figure 3 suggests that the avermectin drug class does not have the same long-term effect on arthropod mortality. For both ivermectin and eprinomectin, mortality dropped below 50% overall after just 14 days from initial dosage. For this reason, the isoxazoline and phenylpyrazole drug classes may be more effective for MDA, although their testing for safety in humans is less extensive (than ivermectin).
Additionally, there is the question of if MDA should be dispensed to humans or livestock. The field study by Poche et al. applied previous findings to the field, dosing cattle in several tribes in Africa and visually measuring the effects on the density of mosquitos found in nearby homes. They observed that the dosage of livestock with fipronil reduced the “resting density” of mosquito species known to feed on both cattle and humans, but did not significantly affect the resting density of particularly anthropophilic species [19]. This study highlights the importance of catering an MDA to the specific species you want to impact by ensuring dosage to vertebrates that it is likely to take a blood meal from.

When considering a drug for use in MDA, the safety of the drug must be copiously studied, and current findings are promising. At the dosages used in the study that were effective against adult arthropods, vertebrates suffered no severe adverse effects attributed to the dosages in all of the studies analyzed. This strongly suggests that these drugs are safe for use in IVM. Additionally, when considering MDA, taking a “One Health” approach will also be key to success. Too often, non-Governmental Organizations have gone into regions with targeted endemic diseases, and neglected to listen to native perspectives on previously used methods of disease control and basic needs. While investigating the efficacy of these drugs is important to protecting communities against vector-borne disease, giving aid to impoverished communities must first address the baseline health of individuals at risk. Only then can we hope to earn the trust of native populations, and continue to help them in sustainable ways. Continuing to thoroughly investigate the efficacy and safety of this sector of vector management before beginning any large implementation will also be essential.

Overall, it can be inferred from the amount of studies performed that there needs to be an enormous amount of research performed before we integrate oral insecticides, especially in humans, into IVM. What we do know, though, gives promise in the face of the insurmountable resistance to traditional pesticides.

<b>Author's Note:</b> The devastating COVID-19 pandemic, having resulted in the death of millions of people worldwide, has spurred innovation in countless sectors of academia, namely in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. By using computer science techniques, researchers have been able to rapidly identify treatments and further analyze the SARS-CoV-2 virus; the following review synthesizes computational advancements in COVID-19 research through immunoinformatics, docking servers, machine learning, and microRNA analysis. This review also incorporates current computational approaches in the treatment and analysis of COVID-19 viral variants. The use of bioinformatics and computational biology, in pursuit of analyzing and treating all forms of COVID-19, has yielded fast and effective therapeutic treatments in conjunction with crucial analytical findings. With much of the United States now opening up, and the virus likely to become a global endemic, the need for fast, computational analysis of the disease, regarding its progression and spread, is invaluable in ensuring public safety.

&nbsp;

<b>Introduction</b>

<span>The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency, with the fast spreading virus having engulfed the world within a few months. The respiratory disease, as of February 2022, has resulted in the death of 5.9 million people worldwide [1]. The viral pathogen behind COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This relentless virus has a mutation rate of 9.8 x 10</span><span>-4</span><span>  substitutions per site per year, which refers to the replacement of a specific DNA base pair with another by means of nucleotide substitution. Given the scale of the genome (the human genome is 3.2 billion base pairs long), the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 allows for substantial changes to the virus’ spike protein, allowing it to evade its host’s defenses and causing new viral variants to crop up around the world [2]. As the prevalence of these variants increases worldwide, the importance of effective computational analysis of COVID-19 protein and antibody dynamics cannot be overstated.</span>

<span>Bioinformatics and computational biology are highly similar, interdisciplinary areas of study that use the core tenets of computer science to analyze biological data. In general, bioinformatics and computational biology are crucial in understanding and analyzing protein dynamics, primarily in regards to sequence, structure, and evolution based analysis (which tracks changes in protein composition over time) [3].</span>

<span>A variety of computational approaches have been and are being investigated in the hopes of better understanding how COVID-19 operates in order to develop effective therapeutic treatments. One such approach concerns the field of immunoinformatics, a subset of bioinformatics and computational biology, which uses protein structures and genome sequences to develop vaccines [4]. Other areas of interest involve the use of docking servers (which predict and model protein-ligand binding interactions) and machine learning to identify and develop COVID-19 therapeutics [5]. Further research is also being conducted in analyzing micro RNA to better understand and exploit the cellular dynamics of COVID-19 [6]. </span>

<span>This review will investigate established computational approaches and will also explore novel research regarding COVID-19 in the hopes of stimulating further research in COVID-19 variant analysis. </span>

<b>A Brief History of COVID-19 </b>

<span>The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December of 2019, first reported in Wuhan, China. The unique virology of SARS-CoV-2 allowed for its rapid progression and spread. The virus itself is covered with spike proteins on its surface; each spike protein consists of three monomeric units which bind to human ACE2 receptor cells [7]. ACE2 receptors are present on the surface of human muscle cells, primarily in the lungs, and act to mediate vascular constriction and inflammation. During COVID-19 pathogenesis, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can bind to the human ACE2 receptor, invade the cell, and proliferate, leading to lung damage. The spike protein has an incredibly high affinity for the ACE2 receptor due to contact interactions which occur at the interface between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor, contributing to the widespread nature of the disease [8].</span>

<p style="text-align: center"><span>Figure 1: The SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism. </span></p>
<span>Currently, in the United States, vaccines have been created for the original viral strain, namely the double dose Pfizer and Moderna (mRNA based) vaccines and the single dose Johnson and Johnson (adenovirus based) vaccine [9]. These vaccines stimulate the host to synthesize a non-pathogenic version of the spike protein, which triggers an immune response and is then targeted by host-specific antibodies (generated in response to the host-mediated spike protein), rendering immunity to the major COVID-19 strain. However, with the rise of new variants, most notably, the omicron B.1.1.529 strain, the effectiveness of mRNA (e.g. Pfizer and Moderna) vaccines are diminishing from 95% efficacy to 35% efficacy, with booster shots required to increase efficacy to 75% [10, 11]. Similarly, the Johnson &amp; Johnson adenovirus based vaccine declined from 94% to 85% efficacy in adenovirus based vaccine therapies in individuals who received booster shots [12, 13].</span>

<b>Applications of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in COVID-19 Research</b>

<span>The field of bioinformatics and computational biology deals in the collection and analysis of biological data, namely genomic and proteomic data, in the hopes of better understanding disease pathogenesis [3]. </span>

<i><span>3.1 Immunoinformatics and COVID-19 Vaccine Development</span></i>

<span>The field of immunoinformatics is a subset of the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. Specifically, it uses computational, analytical, and mathematical data tied in with computer science processing techniques, to formulate predictions about immunity and vaccine development [14]. In the immunoinformatics-based approach to COVID-19 vaccine development and drug discovery, it is important to note that only the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is in contact with the human ACE2 receptor, making the RBD the major functional region of the virus. Accordingly, the major immunoinformatics-based approaches to COVID-19 antibody development target the RBD of the spike protein, preventing its attachment to the ACE2 receptor [15]. </span>

<span>There are two major methodologies of vaccine discovery through immunoinformatics: reverse vaccinology and structural vaccinology [4]. Reverse vaccinology analyzes expressed genomic sequences in order to identify various antigens as potential vaccine targets, as these identified antigens are, ideally, to be synthesized and subsequently targeted by the host immune system. Meanwhile, structural vaccinology uses 3D protein models to engineer immunogenic conformations of antigens in the hopes of eliciting antibody responses against pathogenic attack [16, 17]. Structural vaccinology is not explicitly used in COVID-19 drug discovery, but is incorporated within modern reverse vaccinology techniques [4]. </span>

<span>A new study used reverse vaccinology programs as well as novel computation techniques such as the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area calculation approach, to design a COVID-19 antibody protein that can provoke a wide array of host immune responses [18]. This immunological approach, in its emphasis on reverse vaccinology, has also been successfully implemented in the design of a multi-epitope subunit vaccine, triggering immunity in both humoral and cell-mediated contexts [19].</span><span> Using DNA/PCR visualization software, researchers observed that the multi-epitope vaccine has highly specified, targeted responses to pathogenic invasion via host-mediated immune response </span><span>[19, 20]. </span>

<i><span>3.2 COVID-19 Docking Analysis</span></i>

<span>The SARS-CoV-2 docking procedure binds the pathogen to the host’s ACE2 receptors. It is a key point of interest for many researchers who aim to disrupt this binding configuration to prevent COVID-19 infection [21]. Free energy simulators can be used to visualize the stability of various binding configurations of proteins to ligands with a lower binding free energy value indicating a more stable protein-ligand configuration. Using these computational free-energy simulators that bind ligands to the spike protein, potential antibodies can be developed to block or destabilize host-virus interactions [22]. A variety of preliminary studies have been able to identify potential therapeutic compounds from which drug development can progress.</span>

<span>Furthermore, COVID-19 binding can be simulated by docking servers which model how small molecules, peptides, and antibodies bind to potential targets on SARS-CoV-2. In 2020, a team from China created a free meta-server to predict COVID-19 target-ligand interactions to promote drug discovery [23]. This server has been used in a variety of studies. One study used the server to test docking scores of a variety of potential antiviral agents and found that scalarane-based sesterterpenes (a biochemical) showed promise in developing COVID-19 vaccines [24]. Another study, using the same server, identified teicoplanin, an antibiotic, as a potential source of drug design in combating SARS-CoV-2 infection [25]. </span>

<span>Several other studies have used docking servers to analyze potential plant-based therapeutic targets; including the compounds of the </span><i><span>Boerhavia diffusa</span></i><span>, the phytochemicals of the </span><i><span>Phyllanthus amarus</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Andrographis paniculata</span></i><span>, and hesperidin [26-28]. These compounds were initially chosen due to their therapeutic properties and have been previously used to treat a wide array of diseases. Upon further analysis, resulting simulations show that these chemicals can destabilize the ACE2-spike protein complex, thus rendering host immunity [28]. In addition, in silico molecular docking techniques were used in identifying the antiviral drugs Remdesivir and Mycophenolic acid acyl glucuronide as potential candidates to be repurposed towards COVID-19 treatment, due to their preferential binding to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. This preferential binding can then be used to disrupt the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 receptor cells [29]. </span>

<i><span>3.3 Machine Learning and COVID-19</span></i>

<span>The field of machine learning is a branch of computer science which trains an algorithm to “learn” through feeding it enough data such that it can make logical predictions about a variety of different sets of conditions [30]. </span>

<span>Reverse vaccinology can be combined with machine learning practices to design COVID-19 vaccines. The machine learning tool, known as Vaxign-ML, incorporates biochemical and physicochemical characteristics into its reverse-vaccinology analysis [31]. This platform can then be incorporated with machine learning algorithms, to identify “cocktail” vaccines, consisting of structural and non structural proteins (a protein that is encoded but not part of the viral body), which stimulate an immune response to COVID-19 [32]. </span>

<span>Another aspect of machine learning in COVID-19 research involves a more external approach to attacking the problem. </span><span>Researchers from the Sri Ramaswamy Memorial Institute of Science and Technology were able to train a machine learning algorithm to analyze abnormal chest x-rays and CT scan data in patients exhibiting signs of COVID-19. </span><span>The study yielded a 93% recall score of CT scan images and 88% precision in analyzing chest x-ray images [33]. Similar machine learning algorithms were used in a different study to analyze abnormal features in the CT scan data of patient lungs. This study yielded an accuracy of 91.94% in diagnosing COVID-19 infection [34]. </span>

<i><span>3.4 MicroRNA (miRNA) and COVID-19 Analysis</span></i>

<span>MicroRNAs or miRNAs are pieces of RNA which act to regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally [35]. Researchers from Italy and Singapore found that various miRNAs are regulated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the human ACE2 receptor in conjunction with the enzyme histone deacetylase (HDAC). Through computational analysis, using in silico</span> <span>methods and the query miRNet analytics platform, these researchers were able to identify that HDAC inhibitors limited interactions between the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor [36]. Further studies confirmed the effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors as a preventative drug to restrict SARS-CoV-2 entrance into the host, using a wide array of laboratory tests and culture analyses [37]. Using similar methodologies, another study constructed its own computational meta-analysis framework to identify how host miRNAs bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNA and suggests the repurposing of anti hepatitis C, RNA based, drugs in the treatment of COVID-19, due to its substantial binding affinity [38].  </span>

<b>Current Computational Efforts in COVID-19 Variant Analysis </b>

<span>COVID-19 variants are formed when the virus’ spike protein mutates, making it harder for the established antibodies in vaccinated people to recognize and bind to the pathogen. In some cases, the established antibodies may be able to bind well enough against the variant molecule, while in other cases, a breakthrough infection may occur and the virus is able to override the host’s defense systems [39, 40]. Currently the four major variants of COVID-19 in the United States are: Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) [41]. </span>

<p style="text-align: center"><span>Figure 2: A phylogenetic tree depicting the dominant COVID-19 variants as of December 2021.</span></p>
<span>By using machine learning algorithms, and comparing genome sequences, researchers were able to obtain an overall picture of the spread of variants throughout all continents [42]. Similarly, other researchers were able to track the global progression of coronavirus variants by aggregating data, concerning the worldwide evolution of COVID-19 nucleotide-substitutions, and building an open source web application known as COVID CG to reflect their findings [43]. Other population-orientated studies investigate the genetic, topological, and evolutionary progression of SARS-CoV-2 in order to understand its emergence on the global scale and how to homogeneously apply vaccines to heterogeneous populations, in the hopes of preventing the spread of COVID-19 and its variants in the future [44-46].</span>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4151 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/03/unnamed-29.png" alt="" width="512" height="245" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span>Figure 3: The COVID CG tool, from the end user perspective.</span></p>
<span>Other studies use computational modeling mechanisms to determine how variants interact with ACE2 receptor cells. One such study modeled a wide array of mutations to the spike protein in order to determine variant transmissibility, which can aid in establishing future safety precautions [47]. Another study was able to model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 by computationally comparing it with dengue infection (as dengue fever and COVID-19 have similar symptoms in the earlier stages of infection) to obtain alternate insights into COVID-19 disease progression [48].</span>

<b>Conclusion</b>

<span>The field of bioinformatics and computational biology is expansive in its coverage; it can be narrowed down to analyze specific protein-to-protein interactions on the molecular scale or expanded to examine the global progression of disease. With much of the United States reopening its borders, and students returning to in-person classes, the rapid computational analysis of COVID-19 disease progression on both a micro and macro scale is invaluable in ensuring public safety. </span>

<span>As of January 2022, actions to curb the spread of variants have been taken in the form of booster shots and the Pfizer pill. Booster shots reintroduce the same material as the previously mentioned vaccinations to “boost” or reinforce host immunity by increasing the count of memory B and T cells [49]. Additionally, the FDA approved Pfizer COVID-19 Oral Antiviral Treatment, or Paxlovid, consists of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, with nirmatrelivr acting to prevent viral replication while ritonavir reduces the breakdown of nirmatrelvir. Furthermore, Paxlovid has been proven to be effective against COVID-19 variants in </span><i><span>in vitro </span></i><span>studies [50-52]. </span><span>Ultimately, due to the virus’ rapid evolution, most experts have reached a common consensus, that COVID-19 is likely to continually circulate as an endemic, with yearly vaccines needing to be developed and administered, much like the flu </span><span>[53]. Like the flu, we must continually stay “ahead” of the virus and its variants. Thus, the need for fast, effective computational analysis of the disease and its mutations is essential in mitigating its potentially detrimental effects. </span>

<strong>Author's Note: </strong><span>This article was written to reveal how the COVID-19 vaccines are produced and how they are a safe technology used to help reduce the number of sick individuals. Throughout the article, I will discuss the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines as well as the limitations that scientists overcome. I chose this topic because mRNA vaccines are a “new” technology that many of us don’t understand and has led to a larger social debate. The controversy surrounding mRNA vaccines stems from people's questions regarding the vaccines’ safety and necessity. After reading this article, I hope the reader is able to take away the fact that the mRNA vaccines are safe and effective. </span>

<span>Abstract:</span>

<span>As the world begins to settle after the past year and a half of operating with the COVID-19 pandemic, we look to mRNA vaccines to help return to a sense of normalcy. With both Moderna and Pfizer leading the market of mRNA vaccines since April 2021, we have seen a large decline in cases [27]. However, many people across the country are still skeptical of this “new” mRNA vaccine technology [8] and remain hesitant about getting the vaccine. Additionally, the COVID-19 vaccine controversy has left many individuals wondering if the vaccine is truly a safe way to fight the spread of COVID-19 or not. Currently, 54.7-59% of Americans have been fully vaccinated, but based on a PBS poll 24% have chosen to not receive any dose of the vaccine [40-41]. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the safety of mRNA vaccines, their development, limitations, and potential for treating future diseases. </span>

<span>Introduction:</span>

<span>Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are not a new technology, in fact they have been researched for years. mRNA is a small genetic molecule that encodes specific proteins [33]. The discovery of mRNA in 1961 sparked an entire field of research related to gene regulation [1-5]. </span>

<span>Traditional vaccines work by introducing an antigen (a foreign substance that is recognized by the immune system) to elicit an immune response and cause the body to produce antibodies against that antigen [13]. For nucleic acid vaccines (DNA and RNA vaccines), rather than directly injecting the antigen, the instructions for producing the antigen are introduced into the cell [14]. The cell can then use these instructions to “make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies” [16]. In the case of COVID-19, Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines encode the instructions to make a viral spike protein from SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). The spike protein won’t cause sickness on its own, it trains the immune system to defend against the real SARS-COV-2 virus [38]. While research has been conducted on both DNA and RNA based nucleic acid vaccines, it has been shown that RNA vaccines are able to elicit a stronger immune response and are likely safer [15]. The technology of mRNA vaccines became increasingly promising as scientists used the speed of production of the technology to develop a safe and effective mRNA vaccine to their advantage [50-51]. One of the many reasons the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines work is the way they modify the stability of the mRNA and establish a method for efficient delivery, allowing for a strong immune response when administered [17, 45-47]. Though hesitancy remains surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are both effective and have significantly reduced the infection rate of COVID-19 [27]. This hesitancy has been fueled by reports of conspiracies as well as possible health effects, which all have been proven false and will be discussed later in larger detail.</span>

<i><span>Figure 1. This diagram demonstrates how the SARS-COV-19 vaccine was produced and how it elicits an immune response. Through the mRNA being introduced into the body, the cells gain instructions on how to produce the spike protein and forms antibodies. </span></i>

<span>Proof of Principle:</span>

<span>The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine has brought hope to the medical field because they are effective and can continue to develop. With this technological advancement, it is important to maintain a certain standard of success to build confidence in the vaccines.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set a standard for success of “at least 50%” efficacy, or the prevention of the spread of infection due to the vaccine [18, 53]. The Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccine clinical trials exceeded this standard, granting them Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The application of the mRNA vaccine demonstrated an effectiveness of “90% for full immunization and 80% for partial immunization” [10]. A study, conducted by the CDC in March of 2021, was used to assess the real world application and effectiveness of the vaccine in a potentially infectious setting. As reported by the CDC, the group of vaccinated first responders and essential health care workers were prevented from infection. This study showed that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are highly effective in the real world.</span>

<span>Along with this, there have been observational studies that show the vaccines have reduced the amount of transmission and need for hospitalization [9, 23]. Through a recent study by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it was concluded that the “SARS-CoV-2 vaccines significantly reduce the risk for COVID-19–associated hospitalization in older adults and, in turn, might lead to commensurate reductions in post-COVID conditions and deaths.” [9] </span>

<span>The vaccines have created an opportunity for the world to return to a somewhat normal reality through the concept of herd immunity. Herd immunity is the idea that a “large portion of a community becomes immune to a disease … As a result, the whole community becomes protected—not just those who are immune” [30]. In other words, as more people get vaccinated, the transmissibility of SARS-COV-2 will be significantly reduced. Proof of this comes from the CDC as they discovered that in 1000 working days, infections among unvaccinated individuals (1.38 infections) were significantly higher than both fully vaccinated (0.04 infections) and partially vaccinated individuals (0.19 infections) [10]. To put it simply, the COVID-19 vaccine works. The vaccine has protected individuals throughout the past 6 months, and now that it is readily available we are seeing a massive decline in cases [27]. </span>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4160 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/03/unnamed-31.png" alt="" width="512" height="358" />

<i><span>Figure 2. This diagram demonstrates how herd immunity functions in our society. As shown, the more people that are vaccinated, they are less likely to become infected. </span></i>

<span>Versatility:</span>

<span>        </span> <span>Researchers have started studying possible applications of mRNA vaccines to diseases such as AIDS and other incurable diseases. It has been difficult to make regular vaccines due to the fact that there are so many mutations and strains, however the mRNA vaccine has been able to sidestep that by teaching the body to make antibodies and proteins. Before the modern advancements of mRNA vaccines that the COVID-19 vaccine brought forward, there was no efficient and effective way to deliver mRNA into the cell [31-32]. According to Mu et al. until these recent developments, there were major bottlenecks that hindered such research because mRNA is very unstable and can easily denature [31-32]. With new research, Moderna has begun trials on various mRNA vaccines, including one for HIV and AIDS [29]. </span>

<span>Along with HIV, there has been research into using mRNA vaccines to treat cancer. Two types of vaccines have been proposed for cancer: preventative vaccines and treatment vaccines. Preventative vaccines attempt to protect the body from viruses that can potentially lead to cancer.  HPV and Hepatitis B are two infections where vaccines have been made in an effort to prevent these infections and stop the development of cancer [43]. In this method, the body “mount[s] an attack against cancer cells ... Instead of preventing disease, they are meant to get the immune system to attack a disease that already exists” [43]. Treatment based vaccines, meanwhile, are more personalized to an individual’s genome [49]. To implement this, there must be an understanding of the individual’s specific cancer genome [49]. Scientists identify the mutated genes that are responsible for the tumor growth in the individual. They then encode and inject the mutant mRNA into the body, providing the individual’s immune system with instructions to create the mutated protein. This mRNA enables the body to identify and attack the cells with markers for the mutated gene, which are not present in non-cancerous cells. Moderna implemented a similar approach and found that the method reduced tumor size in 30% of human participants when combined with checkpoint inhibitors, a drug which activates proteins to regulate the immune system when attacking cancer cells  [49, 54]. Through the use of an mRNA vaccine, this allows the body to fight the tumors on its own rather than using harsh chemical mixtures, like chemotherapy, to stop the growth of the cancer. </span>

<span>In regards to the multitude of other infectious diseases, much of the research around mRNA vaccines has already started and will continue. With the full approval of the Pfizer vaccine and current EUA of Moderna, the opportunity for future mRNA vaccines seems promising. As noted in previous research for mRNA vaccines targeting Zika and other diseases, there was a lack of knowledge regarding mRNA vaccines that impacted the ability to create a successful vaccine [19]. Due to the recent advancements, the opportunity to revisit these vaccines is possible.  </span>

<span>Limitations:</span>

<span>Several major hurdles continue to limit the broad application of mRNA vaccines which include cost, safety concerns, and instability of mRNA affecting storage.</span>

<span>Cost: </span>

<span>Due to the severity of COVID-19, funding was readily available in an effort to mitigate the spread of this deadly virus. The federal government was one of the major financial suppliers as they “pledged to give nearly $500 million to Moderna alone for its COVID-19 vaccine”, and this was able to support one of the first COVID-19 vaccines brought forward [24]. Dr. Nathaniel Wang, chief executive of Replicate Bioscience developing RNA-based treatments for cancer, said “</span><span>it’s pretty hard to talk people into taking bets on this type of technology for vaccines in infectious diseases” because it is seen as</span><span> “new” technology [19]. This has been gravely apparent regarding RNA vaccines for diseases like Zika [19]. These financial constraints delayed progress and it made mRNA vaccines a nonviable strategy of treatment for Zika, COVID, and other diseases previously discussed. </span>

<span>Safety: </span>

<span>The safety concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine have been particularly contentious in the U.S. This fear is fueled by misinformation such as rumors of infertility caused by the vaccine and other false claims that have been reported in opinion pieces online. Many of the conspiracy theories and stories that damaged the image of the vaccine originated from social media[21]. A study polled that a majority of Americans believe there was “rushed approval for the COVID-19 vaccine without the assurances of safety and efficacy” causing people to believe that the vaccine bypassed all the regulatory steps [22]. The FDA defines that “for an EUA to be issued for a vaccine... FDA must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine” [39]. Through years of advanced research, the trials and production of the vaccine were able to run in parallel without compromising the safety of the vaccine [50]. While there are some valid concerns specific to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, including myocarditis, blood clots, and potential allergic reactions, the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have been deemed as safe and effective by the CDC [26].</span>

<span>Side effects:</span>

<span>It is possible that individuals will experience certain side effects ranging from pain, swelling in the arm, nausea and fever, along with some more serious side effects, for example myocarditis and blood clots, reported by the CDC. It is important to note that if these less serious side effects even occur they are generally present for less than a week. A small price to pay for a vaccine that has been effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 [23]. This was shown through mouse and hamster trials, as they noted that they had full immune system responses that protected against COVID-19, similar to that of humans [57]. In another study done with rats, they focused on the vaccine’s potential impact on pregnant rats to simulate that of a pregnant woman and found that there are potential side effects on that impact fetal development, female fertility, and early offspring development, but none were observed [58]. </span>

<span>Through a variety of trials, scientists have determined that the body has been able to perform a timely immune response to the vaccine. A measurement of this has been the body's reaction in the form of specific side effects [52]. Only a small number of cases include more serious reactions, such as anaphylaxis (2.5 per 1 million Moderna vaccines). Most cases will only have small reactions and no long-term side effects have been recorded [34, 35]. Though the majority of people only have minor reactions, these side effects show that the vaccine has gotten into the cell and the body has identified the viral mRNA [52]. </span>

<span>Through the immense amount of data showing the vaccine's efficacy, Pfizer has received FDA approval while Moderna has begun the FDA approval process [36, 37]. This milestone highlights the safety and efficacy of both mRNA vaccines. </span>

<span>Storage: </span>

<span>Due to the fact that both Moderna and Pfizer need lower temperatures for stability, they require the vaccines be kept below freezing around -20 to -80 degrees C for long term storage [25]. RNA needs to be stored at lower temperature as it will degrade due to alkaline hydrolysis, (breakdowns on its own in basic conditions) and RNAse activity (a nuclease that cleaves RNA). There have been cases of COVID-19 vaccines being discarded due to improper storage [55]. This limits packaging, shipment, and regions of the world allowed to have access to these vaccines because their storage will require specialized equipment and refrigeration. </span>

<span>Conclusion:</span>

<span>The COVID-19 vaccines have paved a way for more mRNA vaccines to be brought to the medical field. If there is a steady increase in funding, researchers can begin to establish these kinds of vaccines for a variety of different diseases. By working through setbacks and finding a way to deliver vaccinations to the masses as well as bringing money to research, many of the limitations of mRNA vaccines can be mitigated in the future. The COVID-19 vaccine has proven to be quite efficacious and the recent FDA approvals are evident of this. These vaccines have been able to set a precedent of how mRNA vaccines can be used throughout health care as a protective measure.  mRNA vaccines are still considered a “new” technology and will continue to be researched and applied to a wide variety of fields in the future.</span>

<strong>Author's Note: </strong><span>This paper was written as a term paper for my HDE 117 class in which my professor, Dr. Carey, suggested that I submit this paper to the Aggie Transcript. Not only did I write this paper for my class, but I wrote it for myself as one of my goals while taking this class was to improve my writing skills. I chose to write on the effects of aerobic exercises on longevity because of my personal interest in successful aging and general health and well-being. The topic is similar to a previous term paper I wrote for HDE 100C which was The Effects of Aerobic Exercise on Executive Function. I earned a C+ on that paper and I saw this assignment as a redemption and a way to build my research and writing abilities. I hope that the reader is able to take away information on how to avoid or minimize the risk of chronic, degenerative diseases in adulthood. I also hope to introduce the reader to the concept of exercise as medicine. </span>

<b>ABSTRACT </b>

<span>Physical health and cognition are determinants of mortality. These factors are also measurements to discern if aerobic exercise influences longevity. Aerobic exercise is a treatment that has been extensively studied and has been shown to have a positive effect on healthy aging and longevity, such as, lowering mortality in older age, improving VO2 uptake, and increasing lean body mass, which can facilitate greater physiological function in aging adults. Physical activity can ameliorate adverse symptoms resulting from cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke compounded by the presence of Alzheimer’s Disease. An active lifestyle has been linked to greater cognitive function and improved mood. Those who exercise have, on average, greater brain volume which can stall the deteriorating effects of neurological conditions to lengthen one’s life expectancy. The implementation of aerobic exercise and healthy lifestyle practices is a key factor contributing to overall successful aging and mitigating risk of morbidity [1].</span>

<b>Introduction </b>

<span>Physical exercise is a highly effective and often prescribed treatment for a plethora of physical and mental health conditions. There is a strongly reviewed association between daily, moderate exercise and improved health, which becomes more imperative for successful aging. [2]. Healthy aging involves maintaining high function of physiological and cognitive abilities while resisting major diseases such as high blood pressure or Alzheimer’s disease [3]. One means of extending longevity in aging adults is a consistent aerobic exercise regimen such as brisk walking or jogging. By following a succinct, cardiovascular workout routine repeated multiple times a week, multimorbidity, the presence of two or more chronic illnesses, significantly improved. </span>

<b>Procedure </b>

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-4176 size-full" src="https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2022/04/unnamed.jpeg" alt="" width="376" height="106" />

<span>Table 1. The effectiveness of individualized aerobic exercise training combined with telephone-based motivational interviewing on physical activity amount based on mixed model analysis</span><span> [4]</span><span>.</span>

<span>In a longitudinal study, designed to test an aerobic exercise treatment for aging adults, participants were found to have an increase of muscle protein synthesis leading to greater lean muscle and body mass. Physical exercise as a prophylactic was linked to combating frailty. Participants were selected for age and health condition [5]. Aging adults were defined as being 65 years or older and were most often suffering from pre-existing chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer’s due to the subjects being residents of rehabilitation centers. Studies were also selected for individuals who did not already exercise on a regular schedule. </span>

<span> One-hundred fifty minutes of aerobic exercise a week is the recommended benchmark for healthy aging [6]. Physical exercises used as treatment were brisk walking and jogging, on a treadmill or outdoors, and cycle ergometer. Aerobic workouts were performed outdoors with weekly check-ins or completed in a lab or rehabilitation center. Aerobic exercise treatments were structured to be an hour long occurring 3-5 times a week for 12-18 weeks long. Physical and psychological measurements were taken before and after the training routine. </span>

<span>Activities were recommended to either be intentional, such as exercises done with the purpose for gaining health benefits, or for leisure, such as walking to destress. Since lower muscle mass is associated with cancer-related disease, researchers paid attention to increases in muscle mass and VO2 uptake, which can determine brain function and metabolic health [7-8]. More vigorous exercises were allowed but subjects were encouraged to participate in moderate physical activities [9]. </span>

<b>RESULTS </b>

<span>Improved cardiovascular measures positively correlates with greater VO2 uptake, a leaner body mass (measured by BMI), and improved endurance in aerobic exercise [10]. Greater cognitive function is correlated to a decrease in depression after receiving an exercise treatment. Participants exhibited a decrease in high blood pressure, which is a predictor of chronic health conditions. Alzheimer’s patients after exercising on a weekly basis had greater brain volume. Aerobic exercise can help aging adults retain their autonomy in daily life by reducing the naturally occurring physiological stress that accompanies longevity.</span>

<b>Effects on Physical Health </b>

<span> Consistent aerobic exercise can improve different measures of health such as weight, energy and pre-existing conditions such as Type II diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases. Moderate aerobic exercise can have anti-inflammatory effects on the aging body and provide significant relief for chronic pain [11]. Exercises such as walking and jogging on a weekly basis contribute to an increase in peak oxygen consumption by 10 to 15 percent when targeting frailty, the physical and cognitive decline that develops with age [5]. Subjects who adhered to the exercise regimen were reported to have a lower BMI, a greater heart rate reserve, and a lower blood pressure reading after 12 weeks </span><span>[4]</span><span>. For people struggling with cardiovascular diseases such as Type II Diabetes, exercise can be used to help alleviate symptoms, produce healthier measures of fitness, and contribute to an increase in longevity [12].</span>

<span>Lack of physical exercise is linked to an increase in noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and respiratory diseases. In addition, lack of physical exercise can increase hypertension and obesity. Twenty percent of deaths in the United States are due to obesity and Type II Diabetes [9]. The Copenhagen City Heart Study contributed additional evidence to the benefits that aerobic exercise can have on physical health and, in turn, life expectancy. The study concluded that those who are physically active have at least a 30 percent lower mortality risk when compared to inactive participants [13]. Non-joggers treated with an exercise regimen of light to moderate jogging had a significantly lower mortality rate than the sedentary control to prevent the accumulation of diseases that can contribute to high morbidity risk.</span>

<span>Aerobic activities can also improve the quality of life in aging adulthood. Capacity for movement and strength drastically decrease after 65 years, but the addition of aerobic activities in daily life can lead to better blood pressure and bone density [14]. This can help alleviate physical strain from activities of daily living [15]. Aerobic exercise is especially crucial for women, who, on average, experience a more drastic loss in bone density after twenty years. An active lifestyle should be prescribed as medicine and should be performed as a prophylactic and preservation of current ability. Along with reinforcing bone density in older age, aerobic exercise is also linked to retention of muscle mass [16]. As life becomes more sedentary for the aging population, health professionals urge aging populations to keep as mobile as possible. Short durations of exercise can help limit the physiological effects of aging and reduce the impact of chronic disease on activities of daily living [17].</span>

<span>Routine exercise can reduce the risk of many debilitating conditions that can become more prevalent at an older age, such as certain types of cancers and osteoporosis.</span><span> Exercise benefits are directly linked to intensity and quantity of the workout. Aerobic exercise can also increase measures of fitness such as muscle tone, flexibility, and cardiorespiratory function. Oxygen carrying capacity decreases with age which correlates with a 5 to 10 percent decrease in physical ability. The risk of sarcopenia, a decline in muscle strength and volume, increases with age which is why physical fitness becomes more imperative for successful aging [18].</span>

<b>Effects on Cognition </b>

<span>Aerobic exercise has led to improvements in memory processing and improvement in pre-existing neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease and dementia. The progression of Alzheimer’s Disease has been linked to a decrease in brain volume in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus [19]. These brain regions are correlated with episodic memory which stores personal experiences of previous events [20]. Brisk walking on a regular basis significantly slows the growth of brain atrophy in Alzheimer’s, reducing the amount of nonfunctioning years of a patient’s lifespan.</span>

<span>Those with mild cognitive impairment are expected to live 3.5 years (male) and 4.1 years (female) after receiving a diagnosis. Aerobic exercise cannot stop the biological clock, an organism's natural time and physiological cycle, nor can it reverse the effect of dementia. However, aerobic exercise can extend quality of life and extend the functioning years of those with memory diseases [27]. Biological age, the measurement of age based on biological health, is a more accurate predictor of mortality than chronological age [28]. Leukocyte telomere length, a biological age marker, appeared to be nine years healthier in active participants compared to sedentary ones [29]. Aerobic activities can compress the prevalence of symptoms in aging adults [18]. </span>

<span> Aerobic exercise is associated with activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), promoted by the mild stress caused by physical activity. The exposure to mild stress with the purpose to build tolerance and improve cognitive function, known as the process of hormesis, is associated with greater neuroplasticity and thus successful aging [3]. Structural connectivity is not only correlated with better cognitive, overall operational processing, and executive function, working memory and self-regulation, but also with the prevention of Alzheimer’s and dementia. Exercise can help slow down the loss of gray matter and brain volume, contributing to greater longevity in those with degenerative conditions. </span>

<span>As brain volume begins to decrease with age, moderate exercise has been shown to increase cortical thickness in preclinical Alzheimer patients. Decrease in brain volume is one of the most present symptoms of Alzheimer’s, and an active lifestyle could combat the progression of memory loss. Aerobic exercise specifically benefits homeostatic functions such as brain plasticity and neurogenesis [3]. Physical exercise can attenuate amyloid, an abnormal protein made in bone marrow, which can lead to greater cognition. The presence of amyloid beta proteins, an inactive part of the protein amyloid, is linked to memory diseases such as Alzheimer’s [22].</span>

<span>Risk of heart failure along with Alzheimer’s disease greatly increases with age due to rapid myocardial dysfunction and a higher rate of perfusion and inflammation. These risk factors can be worsened by cardiovascular diseases and can lead to cognitive impairment. The progression of Alzheimer’s is linked to a greater risk of stroke due to a buildup of amyloid beta proteins between brain cells. Cognitive decline is found in both conditions and is believed to be linked to the presence of amyloid beta protein build up to form plaque in the brain which affects myocardial function [23]. Likewise, heart disease is linked to the deposition of amyloid plaque into the heart which leads to swelling and stiffness of the soft tissue [24]. </span><span>Exercise has been shown to improve some of the cognitive deficits brought upon by Alzheimer’s such as executive function.</span><span> Cognitive test scores measuring memory, attention, and mood significantly improved after a physical exercise treatment consisting of cycling or psychomotor activities administered 2 to 6 times over the course of 7 weeks [25].</span>

<span>Exercise is significantly correlated to improvement in mood for people with memory conditions such as mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Adherence to an exercise regimen has decreased dependency on others for activities of daily living (ADL) along with increased mood and feelings of self-efficacy. Depression can cause both physiological and psychological stress leading to rapid degeneration due to worsening cognitive symptoms. Physical activity along with environmental enrichment can induce hippocampal neuro-genesis resulting in greater benefits than either physical activity or an enriched environment alone. Aerobic treatments stimulate neural pathways found in the hippocampus, an area of the brain that decreases in function in those with neurodegenerative diseases, leading to greater retention of cognitive operation [25].</span>

<b>Discussion </b>

<span>Aerobic exercise should be prescribed to aging adults to preserve cognitive function with the purpose of extending longevity and improving quality of life. Exercises such as walking or jogging are non-invasive treatments that produce significant improvements in blood pressure, body mass, and cognition. Direct implementation of exercise is crucial for healthy aging and early intervention is associated with a lower risk of developing adult-onset diseases later in life [26]. Participants who have experienced many life stressors were able to find health benefits through routine exercise, especially when combined with other life pillars such as adequate nutrition, well-being, and sleep. Public health professionals and researchers encourage the public to use exercise as medicine [11]. There are currently no FDA-approved medications for functional decline [30]. </span><span>Aerobic exercise is now being regarded as a lifestyle medicine to combat chronic diseases that can develop later in life.</span>

<span>The goal of aerobic exercise is compression morbidity which is reducing the number of years one is disabled and extending the ability to perform ADLs in older age. Successful aging consists of both biological and psychological measures. Causes of death have shifted from infectious diseases to age-related chronic diseases meaning that personal wellness and successful aging are becoming more salient with age. Absence of disease has appeared on surveys measuring feelings of content throughout aging and is a key factor in emotional wellness as well as physical [28].</span>

<span>Aerobic exercise should be done in consideration to the individual. Exercises performed should not negatively impact other physiological functions and can be uniquely designed for the individual’s ability. The CDC recommends 150 minutes per week such as 30 minutes of walking 5 times a week or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week such as running [31]. Aerobic exercise is prescribed as safe and doable for most individuals regardless of socioeconomic status or other sociological categories which makes it a more equitable treatment than pharmaceuticals or invasive surgeries. Aerobic exercises do have barriers that should be accounted for such as access to an appropriate location, lack of time, and disease-specific symptoms that infer with the ability to participate </span><span>[4]</span><span>.</span>

<b>Conclusions </b>

<span>The aging population of this generation is healthier than any previous cohort. To ensure the health of this generation and those to come, aerobic exercise must be incorporated into the weekly routine of the general population. It is important to consider exercise as medicine and as public health policy. With increasing longevity, older populations should place a greater focus on physical independence and the maintenance of well-being in old age. Social institutions, starting as early as primary school and as late as retirement home should encourage walking and light jogging for aging adults to maintain health and foster longevity. Education and encouragement to engage in practices that contribute to successful aging should be promoted to further ensure the health and longevity of future generations. Aerobic exercise is a crucial factor in healthy aging and elicits health benefits that decrease the likelihood of early morbidity.</span>

<b>Author's Note: </b><span>While in the Jin lab at the MIND Institute, I was introduced to the intersection between inflammation and neurodegeneration, specifically in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. My interest in this relationship has primarily been in manipulating inflammatory pathways to investigate the effects on the disease. However, I wanted to step back and understand how they connected, and compile a review on microglial activation as a bridge between the two.</span>

<b>Introduction: </b>

<span>Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. It is still largely untreatable: the last drug approved by the FDA was released nearly two decades ago. Currently, there are only a few available treatments, all of which deal with alleviating symptoms rather than affecting any of the underlying pathology [1]. There are two primary hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid plaques are formed from aggregations of small amyloid beta protein (Aβ); these amyloid beta are the product of cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins found in the membrane of neurons. Neurofibrillary tangles, on the other hand, form from tau protein, which stabilize neuronal microtubules and therefore allow for transport from the cell body to other parts of the neuron. Hyperphosphorylation of tau (a signaling mechanism) leads tao its detachment from the microtubule and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles [2, 3]. </span>

<span>Both amyloid plaques and NFTs are implicated in neurodegeneration and cognitive loss. Amyloid plaques are thought to be precursors that trigger a cascade culminating in neurodegeneration. On the other hand, the loss of support for microtubules in NFTs leads to impaired axonal transport, resulting in synaptic loss and neuronal dysfunction in an Alzheimer’s brain [2]. This review will explore an emerging aspect of Alzheimer’s research, microglial activation, as a means of mitigating both of these pathological characteristics of the disease thereby providing a potential avenue for approaching treatment. </span>

<b>The Role of Microglia:</b>

<span>In order to approach microglial activation, it is necessary to establish neuroinflammation’s role in neurodegeneration. Neuroinflammation refers to the central nervous system’s immune response, activated in response to trauma, pathogens, or the amyloid protein aggregations of Alzheimer’s, among others [2, 4]. It is a necessary immune response, but an overactive or continuous inflammatory response can be harmful, as evident in the body’s release of anti-inflammatory mediators alongside pro-inflammatory cytokines [2, 4]. Proinflammatory cytokines (proteins that are critical for immune signaling) such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), have various adverse effects on neuronal function including neuronal death, synaptic loss, and synaptic “pruning” or stripping [2, 5]. Therefore, unmitigated neuroinflammation can drive neurological disease, and is implicated in the pathology of all neurodegenerative diseases [4]. </span>

<span>The main instruments of neuroinflammation are microglia: non-neuronal phagocytic cells that are the primary proponents of the brain’s immune response. Microglia recognize potential pathogens or irritants through receptors, and in response phagocytose and/or degrade the irritant while releasing cytokines, chemokines and interferons, immune signaling proteins [2]. There are two microglial activation states which dictate the inflammatory response: the “M1” or pro-inflammatory state associated with exacerbating neurodegeneration, and the “M2” or anti-inflammatory state [2, 4]. It must be noted that this binary is simplified, and currently under research. The overactivation of the inflammatory response can be linked to the M1 state of microglia. When inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β were released by microglia, they amplify the inflammation by activating more microglia, creating a positive feedback loop of neuroinflammation characteristic of a diseased state. </span>

<span>Based on their role in neuroinflammation, researchers have looked to microglia as key players in Alzhiemer’s pathology. Numerous research studies have indicated that microglial activation is increased in Alzheimer’s by observing increased expression of microglial receptors in the diseased brain [3, 6]. An example of this is a study that utilized [11C](R)-PK11195, a carbon labeled ligand specific to phagocytic cells. The ligand’s specificity to microglia was increased, allowing it to serve as an indicator for microglial activation. They found a significant increase of microglial activation in Alzheimer’s patients. Furthermore, the pattern of microglial activation physically mirrored the disease’s progress in the brain in terms of atrophy, among other indicators [5]. The research is supported by previous studies as well, all of which suggested that microglial activation is an early event in neurodegeneration, as it was present in mild/early cases of Alzheimer’s [3, 5]. The immune response appeared to escalate into causing more damage as the disease progressed [3]. </span>

<b>Amyloid Plaques:</b>

<span>Decades-old research has confirmed the involvement of microglia in Alzheimer's by demonstrating that microglia cluster around amyloid plaques. There is a progressive increase of activated microglia closer to dense plaque buildup, as well as a linear increase of activated microglia as overall plaque numbers increase [7]. As previously mentioned, amyloid precursor protein splicing leads to a beta amyloid protein; a derivative of the splicing, sAPP-α, has been shown to activate microglia. As microglia are activated by irritants, this falls in line with the general defense role of microglia. The sAPP-α protein, especially an Alzheimer’s-causing isoform which is more likely to aggregate, acts as a threat and thereby activates microglia. As an assumed consequence of the microglial activation, the same study verified that the presence of sAPP-α also increased inflammatory protein expression [8]. </span>

<b>Tau Protein Involvement:</b>

<span>In addition to amyloid plaques, microglia have more recently been linked to the other hallmark of AD, neurofibrillary tau tangles. Similar to amyloid plaques, a linear pattern between NFT’s and activated microglia has also been shown [7]. Further supporting this connection, experimental depletion of microglia has led to decreased tau propagation [9]. Interestingly, although inflammatory mediators observed in one study were increased in patients with tau tangles and neurodegeneration, this was not the case in patients with only amyloid plaques. This highlights the importance of tau in microglial activation, as well as the difference in microglial relations between the two [3].</span>

<span>The interconnection between microglia and tau is proposed to be due to microglial phagocytosis of damaged neurons containing misfolded tau. The tau is secreted in exosomes, and these “seeds” of misformed tau protein are capable of inducing other tau to misfold and aggregate [6, 9, 10]. Although the exact mechanism of microglia engulfing tau is unclear, this theory fits with the overall degenerative pathology of Alzheimer's in that microglia “prune” already damaged neurons and then engulf them. This increased tau phagocytosis and consequent release of misfolded tau increases overall NFTs, thereby further aggravating the disease state.  </span>

<b>Tau, Amyloid and Microglia:</b>

<span>Microglia may also play a role in the pattern of tau accumulation and growth in the Alzheimer’s brain. Typically, as the disease progresses, NFTs “grow” in specific patterns or stages, culminating in the neocortex, the part of the brain devoted to higher cognitive functioning. This accumulation of plaques and NFTs in the neocortex is theorized to be the cause for dementia [6]. The propagation of tau, however, is still not fully understood—research is being conducted on whether microglial activation could be a cause. The current understanding of Alzheimer’s pathology via the amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that amyloid plaques precede other aspects of Alzheimer’s pathology and neurodegeneration, and that tau tangles occur as a result of the “cascade” [2]. However, a recent study proposed that microglia could be the key player in this cascade. Microglia are theorized to act on Aβ, thereby increasing tau propagation, although they are not directly implicated in tau spread. Studies have shown a correlation between activated microglia with the development of cognitive impairment and dementia, supporting the theory that microglia are responsible for the tau propagation patterns seen as AD progresses [6]. This bridge between tau and amyloid via microglia-driven inflammation is further elucidated by another study. Researchers propose that microglial activation, intended to clear amyloid, additionally activates kinase pathways, specifically p38MAPK, directly/indirectly increasing tau phosphorylation, leading to neurofibrillary tangles [11]. </span>

<i><span>Figure 1. In the healthy neuron, tau stabilizes the neuron, but in the diseased state, the phagocytosis of misfolded tau culminates in the formation of more tau misfolding when it is released. For amyloid, specific cleavage sites result in oligomers prone to aggregation which ideally is phagocytosed by the microglia </span></i>

<b>Potential Influence on Treatment: </b>

<span>Based on the role of microglia in immune activation and its implication in Alzheimer’s pathology, inhibition of microglial activation could theoretically be neuroprotective against the disease, among other neurodegenerative diseases in which neuroinflammation plays a key role. Research published earlier this year expanded on this idea. Based on increased expression of a receptor in activated microglia found in Parkinson's, a neurodegenerative disease similar to Alzheimer’s in that it is also marked by cognitive deficits, the researchers proposed utilizing the agonist NLY0. Not only did the administration of the agonist block microglial activation, it also reduced inflammatory mediators that in turn activate astrocytes, another glial cell, preventing the cycle of neuroinflammation to neurodegeneration. There were also reduced Aβ plaque numbers in an Alzheimer’s model, and perhaps as a result, improvements in cognition such as improved memory [1]. </span>

<b>Conclusion: </b>

<span>Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by inflammation, through which microglia, as proponents of the brain’s immune response, are implicated in the development of the disease. The two main hallmarks of the disease — amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles — are both associated with increased levels of activated microglia. However, in both cases, it is difficult to determine whether increased microglia are present as a result of neurodegeneration or whether they contribute to neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, emerging research places microglia as an important component of the amyloid cascade, by which Aβ and NFTs are connected. Neuroinflammation triggered by the need to clear amyloid plaques may lead to hyperactive kinase activity, hyperphosphorylating tau and leading to NFTs. </span>

<span>Given microglial involvement, further research is needed to investigate the potential of microglial inhibition in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, amongst other neurological diseases. However, the established interplay between microglia and Alzheimer's pathology provides an important avenue in which to investigate related treatment options while illuminating the connection between inflammation and neurodegeneration. </span>
