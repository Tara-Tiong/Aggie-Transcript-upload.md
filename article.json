However, the general public has offered little attention towards the use of this engineering feat in a broader ecological system. Upon watching the new Netflix original </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Un</span></i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">natural Selection</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, discussion of considering the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in New Zealand\u2019s effort to completely eradicate invasive species piqued my interest. The following article is an exploration of CRISPR/Cas9 prospect into New Zealand\u2019s bold environmental pursuit and its potential ecological impact.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Abstract</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since it has become feasible to cross oceans to reach unforeseeable land masses, invasive alien species (IAS) are an increasing threat to international biodiversity. Moreover, no other region faces as great of a peril as New Zealand (NZ), which holds the record as the nation </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">with the highest survival rate of threatened avifauna (birds of a particular region) species</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">[5]. In 2012, New Zealand physicist Sir Paul Callaghan introduced a large-scale eradication program to permanently remove eight invasive mammalian predators (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">rodents: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus rattus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus norvegicus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rattus exulans</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mus musculus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; mustelids: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela furo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela erminea</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mustela nivalis</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">; and the common brushtail possum: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Trichosurus vulpecula</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) [5]. Four years after this grand proposal, the NZ government committed to a national challenge titled \u201cPredator Free 2050\u201d (PF 2050) to pursue this audacious goal.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Approximately 85 million years ago, NZ was one of the first landmasses to split from the supercontinent Gondwana and as it shifted away, it did not carry mammals until bats flew and aquatic species swam to this island. [7]. With the introduction of rodent species initially through Polynesian settlement some 750 years ago and thereafter European seafaring ventures, the endemic species of NZ have been left vulnerable to novel predators. Consequently, at least 51 native bird species that have evolved adaptive skills of remaining close to the ground have been unsuccessful at surviving alongside these rodent predator species [4]. These invasive omnivorous rodents prey on birds, eggs, seeds, snails, lizards, and fruits. As a result, their varied diets prompt competition with the native fauna, further placing pressure on their vulnerable survival [7]. Despite CRISPR/Cas9 modifications offering the greatest potential in gene drive to eliminate these unwanted predators, several techniques implemented to control these invasive populations,\u00a0 such as pesticides, trapping innovations, and biological factors have given favorable results.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Past Successes and Future Endeavors\u00a0</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For decades, the NZ government has pursued eradication initiatives to permanently eliminate foreign invasive species on small local islands. Through concerted efforts, several of these projects have proven successful in the restoration of the natural biodiversity this island nation boasts.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In June of 2009, the NZ Department of Conservation (DOC) undertook a multi-action plan to simultaneously eradicate rodent, rabbit, stout, hedgehog, and cat species in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rangitoto and Motutapu islands. After three years of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">aerial dispersion of anticoagulant Pestoff 20R</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TM</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> combined with trapping and indicator dogs, the island witnessed </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">total elimination of the islands\u2019 stoats and four rodent species; declination of rabbit and hedgehog population by 96%; and over 50% reduction in cats [7].\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite these successful feats, the invasive species fecundity and ability to adapt to these challenges still present an overwhelming challenge to reach the goal of complete eradication. Recently, more direct approaches delving into novel genetic inheritance techniques have been explored to serve as a potential permanent solution. Termed the\u201cTrojan Female Technique\u201d (TFT), the method makes use of the correlation of sperm fitness dependence on the abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [2]. Healthy sperm is dependent on sufficient mitochondrial level for energy production to manage motility and fertilization. For example, experiments conducted on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Drosophila melanogaster</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> supports the causation of reduced spermatogenesis and sperm maturation due to induced mutations in cytochrome mitochondrial gene [9]. Contrasting female eggs, the asymmetric greater dependence of sperm on mtDNA for normal functionality results in only male populations to be the sole source of target. Induction of mitochondrial mutations in females to compromise total sperm viability in future male progenies will serve as an effective control to population growth.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although seemingly promising, TFT is not guaranteed to completely eradicate propagation for several reasons. For starters, males with impaired fertility can still provide sufficient sperm count to fertilize eggs on a population-based scale. Furthermore, in circumstances where females do receive nonviable sperm count, they can still seek adequate functioning sperm through matings with other males. On a larger scale, should the mutation pervade, selection pressures could still inadvertently choose for nuclear modifications to make up for the mitochondrial defects [2]. These flaws raise the need for more pervasive and permanent resolutions.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Daisy Chain CRISPR Gene Drive</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The recent biochemical breakthrough underpinning the ability to effectively and precisely modify genes with CRISPR/Cas9 has allowed for potential biotechnology to boom in the realm of ecology. The simple generation of a short RNA sequence into a virus or bacterium to serve as a vector, guides the cutting mechanism of Cas9 to specific regions in the genome to be excised, prompting for these double stranded breaks to be fixed through DNA repair mechanisms. While these fixtures can potentially repair the gene, it can also raise the possibility for the gene to be disabled, introduce a new function, or create an unforeseen mutation. Given the right specific targeting in the germ line, this approach houses the innovation for exterminating entire species through gene drive [6].</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The mechanism behind gene drive overthrows the traditional Mendelian sexual reproduction concept of proportional contribution from both the male and female parent. The power comes from the ability of one genetically modified (GM) contributor encoding for the \u2018gene drive\u2019 to cut the other set of chromosomes lacking these genes and replace this excision with a self-replicating copy. In effect, this divisive modification would push for an otherwise heterozygous offspring from a wild-type mating with a GM partner to become homozygous for certain genes to be carried on and propagated by future generations. Given that these genetic alterations do not affect the fitness of the organism, dissemination of 1% of the population with CRISPR modified genes can lead to 99% of the local population carrying the genetic indicator in as little as nine generations (The use of gene editing to create gene drives for pest control in New Zealand).</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2752 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"62\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-300x62.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-230x47.png 230w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-300x62.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-350x72.png 350w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-480x99.png 480w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-768x158.png 768w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-830x171.png 830w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-1024x211.png 1024w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed.png 1183w\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Such a unilateral approach poses political and ethical challenges amongst neighboring nations with diverging ecological approaches to confront pest control. Should this pervasive gene drive program reach beyond its intended border, great difficulty would arise in maintaining this ecological enclosure. For example, possum is on the list of invasive species in NZ while just 2,500 miles west, its neighbor Australia keeps this species of marsupials under protection. As such, scientists have devised a simple model to localize gene alterations, coined The Daisy Chain.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2751 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"243\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://aggietranscript.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-300x243.png\" srcset=\"https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-230x187.png 230w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-300x243.png 300w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2-350x284.png 350w, https://aggietranscript.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/445/2020/03/unnamed-2.png 439w\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike the original gene drive method in which all components necessary for transformation (CRISPR, edited DNA, and guide RNAs) are provided on the same chromosome, Daisy Chain provides a self-exhaustive means of guaranteeing genetic edits. This tool is designed so that\u00a0 each component required for genetic alteration is dependent on the presence of a different element upstream on the gene found on the same locus to be activated [8]. The most downstream portion of this chain contains the \u201cload\u201d of engineered dominant lethal genes preventing reproduction, which will be promoted to higher frequency in the population within several generations. For instance, should an engineered allele contain three elements A, B, and C, element C would render element B to drive, which will in turn cause element A carrying the final load to drive. The initial element (C in this case) does not actually drive, thus is restricted by the number of altered individuals released into the wild and will be lost via natural selection over time. During initial implementation, the presence of C will increase B in abundance, but B will eventually decline and finally disappear as C is lost in the population. The rapid rise in abundance of B will also cause A to increase in frequency within the local population; however, with the decrease of B, A would not be driven and will ultimately vanish as well [1]. Using MIT Professor Esvelt\u2019s analogy, \u201c\u2026 the elements of a daisy drive system are similar to booster stages of a genetic rocket: those at the bottom of the base of the daisy-chain help life the payload until they run out of fuel and are successively lost.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Challenges with Daisy Chain CRISPR Gene Drive</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CRISPR/Cas9 technology\u2019s ability to potentially alter these invasive species\u2019 fecundity provides an avenue of pursuing NZ\u2019s goal of PF 2050. Despite the developed understanding of how to carry out this plan, scientists in NZ are still working to piece together the genomes of stoats and possums in order to understand where to properly facilitate the engineered RNA sequence. Other barriers that must be acknowledged are the unprecedented approach to genetically modify marsupials and the difficulty of implanting hundreds to thousands of oocytes to be dispersed amongst their population.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond these known difficulties, scientists still tread in unknown terrains pertaining to whether these mutations can have pernicious effects in the survival, health, and reproductive success in propagating these mutations within their populations. Further exploration into the development of these modifications, and the potential impacts they can have on these animals, must be investigated on model organisms prior to widespread use.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Of the eight listed mammalian species vied to be permanently eradicated from NZ, Mus musculus holds the most promise, given the extensive knowledge of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mus musculus</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> genome. With the help of scientists outside of New Zealand, joining in on the efforts to identify which germline gene to focus on, this project has received international attention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although the daisy drive provides promising potential, research collaborators at MIT and Harvard have identified a possible risk of, \u201c\u2026 DNA encoding a drive component from one element to another, thereby creating a \u2018daisy necklace\u2019 capable of a global drive\u201d [1]. Due to this rare recombinatory event arising from the similarity of DNA sequences, these investigators have looked into circumventing the problem by creating numerous alternatives to CRISPR components and selecting the model with the greatest diversity.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>Conclusion</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From their renowned aviary to reptilian species, New Zealand\u2019s islandic geographical region houses some of the most biodiverse fauna known to man. The arrival of human settlement has introduced predatory species, causing endemic species to experience extinction at concerning rates [4]. With the purpose of preserving their unique remaining diversity, New Zealand has committed to concerted efforts of varying methods to eradicate these invasive vertebrate pests. Investigation into genetic modifications can provide for more expansive and thorough techniques to eliminate these human introduced pests and allow for these endangered species to thrive once again. By further exploring daisy chain CRISPR/Cas9, this effort can be genetically inherited by offspring, allowing for nature to carry out this effort. As opposed to continued efforts of targeting each individual one by one, conservation ecologists can borrow from molecular biologist\u2019s toolkit to revolutionize the means of pursuing pest control and perhaps even pave the road for future endeavors with similar pursuits.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Esvelt, Kevin M. \u201cDaisy Drives.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sculpting Evolution</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, www.sculptingevolution.org/daisydrives.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Gemmell, Neil J., et al. \u201cThe Trojan Female Technique: a Novel, Effective and Humane Approach for Pest Population Control.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 280, no. 1773, 2013, pp. 1\u20136., doi:10.1098/rspb.2013.2549.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Griffiths, Richard, et al. \u201cSuccessful Eradication of Invasive Vertebrates on Rangitoto and Motutapu Islands, New Zealand.\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Biological Invasions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 17, no. 5, 2014, pp. 1355\u20131369., doi:10.1007/s10530-014-0798-7.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Owens, Brian. \u201cThe Big Cull: Can New Zealand Pull off an Audacious Plan to Get Rid of Invasive Predators by 2050?\u201d </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nature</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, vol. 541, 12 Jan. 2017, pp. 148\u2013150.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Russell, James C., John G.
