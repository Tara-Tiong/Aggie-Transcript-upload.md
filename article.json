I was preparing to apply for the Undergraduate Research Center Provost Undergraduate Fellowship and felt this would be a good way to inform myself about a protein related to my own undergraduate project in Jodi Nunnari\u2019s lab. \u00a0I was puzzled that different experiments could lead to such conflicting findings on the same issue; thus, writing this review was an invaluable learning experience for me as both an undergraduate student and scientist.\u201d</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px\"><span id=\"more-883\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In mammalian cells, mitochondria are not only essential to energy production in the form of ATP, but they also play regulatory roles in overall metabolism and cell component recycling. \u00a0Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s have previously been linked to defects in mitochondria morphology, hinting that mitochondrial form greatly affects both cell homeostasis and mitochondrial function</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0\u00a0Mitochondria maintain their function by ensuring proper mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) distribution throughout the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, mitochondria have their own genome encoding 13 proteins essential for cellular respiration, as well as 22 tRNAs and 2 rRNAs</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0The distribution of this mtDNA is maintained by balanced fusion and fission of the mitochondrial membranes;</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> moreover, recent data has shown that mtDNA synthesis precedes endoplasmic reticulum-mediated mitochondrial division (ERMD), suggesting that mtDNA biogenesis plays a role in maintaining mitochondria morphology</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">3,4</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Additionally, these ER-mitochondria contact sites prove to not only be essential for mtDNA synthesis, but also for lipid and calcium exchange</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">5,7</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Enzymes required for phospholipid biogenesis are enriched at these contact sites, where a fraction of precursors, such as phosphotidylcholine and phosphatidylserine, are imported from the ER to the mitochondria inner membrane for modification into various lipids crucial for cellular function</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">5,6</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Additionally, calcium import from the ER to the mitochondria is key for processes that require Ca</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2+</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> binding, such as mitochondria motility, apoptotic signaling and energy production cascades</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">7,8</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Without these ER-mitochondria contact sites, both mitochondrial and cellular function are disrupted.</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> \u00a0From a clinical view, abnormal mitochondria morphology, lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis are cellular phenotypes present in Alzheimer\u2019s patients</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">1</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. Thus, a structure that tethers the two organelles together is essential for preserving overall cellular and bodily function. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In yeast, the ER and mitochondria are tethered by the ER-mitochondrial encounter structure (ERMES), a tetrameric complex that facilitates various biological processes between the two organelles</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">9</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Although the discovery of ERMES provided great insight on contact sites in yeast, the proteins composing ERMES do not have mammalian orthologs. \u00a0This lack of mammalian orthologs caused many scientists to look to other proteins that have potential tethering ability. \u00a0Two potential candidates, mammalian proteins Mitofusin 1 and Mitofusin 2 (MFN1, MFN2), 80% homologous dynamin-related GTPases, facilitate outer mitochondrial membrane fusion to maintain proper morphology and mtDNA distribution</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">2,10</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Because these proteins have the ability to connect one mitochondria to another, they were identified as tethering candidates, and their functions became subject to further investigation</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Mitofusin 2 Proposed as an Er-Mitochondria Tethering Agent Through Light Microscopy</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Subsequently, de Brito and Scorrano proposed Mitofusin 2, specifically, as an ER-mitochondria tether based on light microscopy data suggesting decreased mitochondria-ER contacts in MFN2 KO mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs). \u00a0Scrutiny of the enrichment of MFN2 at mitochondria associated membranes (MAMs) on the ER by immunofluorescence analysis in these cells suggested that the amount of ER-mitochondria association was reduced in MFN2 KO cells, but not MFN1 KO cells</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0This group also determined that 59% of total MFN2 in the cell was present at MAM. \u00a0To observe the extent of MFN2\u2019s role on each organelle\u2019s tethering capability, they synthesized a MFN2 mutant restricted to the mitochondria membrane (MFN2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">ActA</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">). \u00a0While MFN2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">ActA</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> restored mitochondria morphology and not ER tethering ability, expressing a MFN2 mutant restricted to the ER membrane (MFN2</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">cb5</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">) restored ER morphology and tethering, but not that of the mitochondria</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Together, these data suggest that MFN2 is embedded at the ER surface and is a mammalian ER-mitochondria tethering agent</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">11</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Critics, however, suggested further investigation on what happens to these contact sites over time in the absence of MFN2, as not all ER-mitochondria contacts give rise to mitochondria division and chemical transport</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Additionally, light microscopy only indicates colocalization (points of overlapping fluorescence) and cannot prove or disprove physical interactions. \u00a0Thus, in order to accept this proposal these critics called for \u00a0more data quantification with higher resolution microscopy</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">12,13</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.</span></p>\n<p><h4>Mitofusin 2 Decreases Tethering by Electron Microscopy</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Following this publication, Cosson et al. quantified more data and used higher resolution electron microscopy (EM) to observe increased ER mitochondria contacts in MFN2 KO MEF cells, thereby contradicting the previous light microscopy data</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Whereas light microscopy\u2019s resolution is limited to observing the whole cell in tens of micrometers, electron microscopy allows scrutiny of one individual contact site within hundreds of nanometers. \u00a0Observation of these cells via EM indicated that WT MEF cells had approximately 50% fewer mitochondria membranes juxtaposed to the ER than that of MFN2 KO MEF cells: this group speculates that the differences in their data and that of the previous group were due to microscope resolution</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Additionally, when over-expressing MFN2 protein levels, these scientists observed a decreased number of ER-mitochondria contacts; together, these data provide high resolution, quantitative evidence that Mitofusin 2 is not a tether between the ER and mitochondria, and that Mitofusin 2 actually decreases their association</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">12</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Because this study provided contradicting evidence for a previously accepted model, there remained a need for a third party to verify or dismiss these findings. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Negative Regulation of Er-mitochondria contact sites via Mitofusin 2</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Filadi et al. investigated the discrepancy between the two groups\u2019 opposing findings and repeated experiments in both confocal and electron microscopy. After duplicating both experiments and reaching the same opposing conclusions as the previous two groups, they determined that the discrepancy lies within electron microscopy\u2019s 80x more magnification, making EM more suitable for observing the mitochondria outer membrane perimeter</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">13</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0By quantifying the data via confocal microscopy in a way that accounts for this difference, they determined that cells lacking MFN2 actually have increased overlapping ER and mitochondria perimeter, supporting Cosson et al.\u2019s electron microscopy data. \u00a0To rigorously test the idea that MFN2 is not a tether, contact stability\u2014as opposed to number of contacts\u2014was measured over time in the absence of MFN2 via confocal microscopy. \u00a0Because overlapping fluorescence may occur randomly, and only a subset of ER-mitochondria contacts persist and give rise to division or chemical import, measuring contact stability indicates whether these functions can still occur normally within cells lacking MFN2 protein. \u00a0Ultimately, the stability of these contact sites was unaffected by the presence or absence of MFN2, negating MFN2 as a tethering agent</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">13</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0To that end, this group attributes the contrasting findings to differences in biochemical techniques, as they both used light microscopy to come to opposite conclusions</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. </span></p>\n<p><h4>Critical reappraisal arguing Mitofusin 2 is an Er-mitochondria tether</h4></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">In response to Cosson et al. and Filadi et al., Scoranno\u2019s group recently published exhaustive data using novel biochemical and cellular techniques to demonstrate that Mitofusin 2 is in fact an ER-mitochondria tether</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0After considering the differences in data quantification, this group developed a new system to evaluate contact sites: they considered both the distance between the ER and mitochondria and overlapping perimeters. \u00a0They report that this newly quantified data still supports the idea that MFN2 KO cells have reduced contacts. \u00a0To further test whether MFN2 is a tether, they used a dimerization-dependent fluorescent marker that will only fluoresce if two molecules targeted to different areas of the cell are in close proximity. \u00a0From these experiments, it was determined that cells lacking MFN2 have reduced fluorescence, again supporting their previous conclusion that Mitofusin 2 is an ER-mitochondria tether. \u00a0They ascribe the mismatch in experimental findings to methods of cell culture, stating that if cells become too confluent on a petri dish, it can affect mitochondria calcium reuptake and tethering ability</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">14</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. \u00a0Scrutiny of previous studies on calcium transfer, as well as future studies exploring not only Mitofusin 2, but also other proteins active at contact sites, will help validate MFN2 as a tether and identify other potential tethering agents necessary for cellular function. \u00a0</span></p>\n<p><h4>References</h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Area-Gomez, E. et al.
